With costs of at least £25 per session, many parents can’t afford it.‘The government should look at introducing a means-tested voucher scheme to enable lower income families to provide tuition for their children.‘Schools should also consider the implications of teachers offering paid tuition outside of lessons and how this is promoted in school.’The study also found ethnic minority children are almost twice as likely to have a private tutor in comparison with their white peers.It found 42 per cent of children from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds have tutoring, while among white children it is just 22 per cent.Some of the most prolific users of tutors are Asian children, with 46 per cent using them.The figures will add further weight to the theory that on average, ethnic minority families may be more motivated to succeed.Experts have previously warned that white working class children are falling behind because they are stuck in communities which lack aspiration.The Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), the Sutton Trust’s sister charity, has identified one-to-one and small group tuition as a way to boost attainment.The charity said schools should consider prioritising one-to-one and small group tuition in order to ‘level the playing field’.Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: ‘Increasing use of private tuition reflects the worries that the Government has unnecessarily created in so many parents’ minds about school standards and students’ prospects.‘Although offering support to students whose parents can’t afford private tuition may seem appealing, any extra funding available for disadvantaged students should be directed at addressing the shortfalls in pupil premium funding and the Government’s decision to favour schools in less disadvantaged areas in its own recent funding announcement.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Moth five inch wingspan experts thought extinct resurfaces again","story":"Share this article \u0027Already this year, we have received reports to our migrant insect news service, Flight Arrivals, of Clifden nonpareil sightings from Cornwall, Devon, Sussex, Warwickshire, Suffolk, Dorset, Kent, Norfolk, Somerset and Northamptonshire.\u0027Some of these are likely to be immigrants and some part of the recently established resident populations.\u0027When we started Moth Night 20 years ago, this moth was a very rare immigrant but it is now becoming familiar to moth enthusiasts across southern Britain.\u0027This illustrates just how quickly change can take place and that\u0027s why moths are such a fascinating group of insects to study.\u0027Coming at the peak of the Clifden nonpareil season, Moth Night 2019 is a fantastic opportunity to map the current range of this species in Britain.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Customers paying 100 year broadband","story":"Share this article Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom\u0027s consumer group director, said: \u0027Broadband customers who are out of contract can make big savings - around £100 a year on average - by picking up the phone to their current provider and signing up to a better deal.\u0027And in future, everyone will be told about the best tariff on offer.

But they are obscured by unreliable male narratorsOnly two women get any real page space in Donna Tartt’s debut The Secret History: Camilla Macaulay, the ethereal yet steely sole female member of the novel’s core friendship circle and Judy Poovey, the vulgar and brash Californian with a crush on the novel’s narrator, Richard Papen. The two seem to come from different planets. Camilla is cool, intelligent, untouchable, beautiful Judy has “wild clothes, frosted hair, and a red Corvette with California plates bearing the legend JUDY P” as well as a voice “which rang through the house like the cries of some terrifying tropical bird”.For a while, I played a game with the rest of Tartt’s female characters that goes: Camilla or Judy? The Goldfinch’s narrator Theodore Decker’s unrequited love, Pippa, is a Camilla, as is his mother Audrey background girlfriends Xandra and Kotku are Judys. It’s strangely easy to fit every woman into these two categories, as though there are only two ways to be a woman.The scarcity and restraint of female characters in Tartt’s novels is frustrating, even to super-fans like myself. Where Theo grows up in real time in The Goldfinch and Richard gets to anxiously navigate both college experience and murder plot in The Secret History, Tartt’s only female main character – Harriet Dufresnes, the 12-year-old heroine of The Little Friend – is forever stalled in time, dreading a womanhood that never arrives.Her youth allows her to escape the Camilla-Judy classification system, and it’s hard to imagine her growing up into either. She’s too dour to be a Camilla, too curious and clever to be a Judy. But what seems at first a more nuanced version of femininity is quickly subsumed into a wider disgust at adult womanhood Harriet fears adolescence, especially the “horrifying new indignity of being classed … a ‘Teen Girl’: a creature without mind, wholly protuberance and excretion”.The other women in The Little Friend are defined strictly in opposition to Harriet, and found lacking. Harriet’s older sister Allison is a “mild, gentle girl”, unlike Harriet the “bright-eyed tiger cub”. “There were plenty of girls at school prettier than Harriet, and nicer,” Harriet’s best friend Hely (a boy) thinks. “But none of them were as smart, or as brave.” The teenage girls at Harriet’s summer camp are filthy in their visceral physicality and stupid to boot: “Their conversation (the Bay City Rollers the Osmonds some boy named Jay Jackson who went to their school) bored and irritated her.” Harriet’s only hope is to hold on to her fierce sense of interiority and selfhood even as her teen years begin, but we never know if she succeeds. The novel ends before she has to try.Given Tartt’s skill in writing friendships, it is remarkable that there are no real friendships between women in any of her three novels. Camilla is the only girl in The Secret History’s gang Kitsey’s friendships with other women in The Goldfinch are alluded to without description in The Little Friend, Harriet’s only friend is a boy who can barely keep up with her.It’s easy to condemn Tartt for the lack of women in her work. It may pass the Bechdel test on technicalities – Judy Poovey talks to friends in The Secret History there is a mother-daughter conversation in The Goldfinch – but the Bechdel test’s ultimate goal of substantial representation cannot be satisfied by her novels. Women rarely speak, plot or work together, nor even fight or love one another. But our immediate attraction towards a particular kind of feminist impulse will lead us down the wrong avenues when it comes to Tartt, because in fact every one of her women is rich, dangerous and complex. The problem is that they can’t be touched.The great pleasure and privilege of Tartt’s first-person perspective is its all-encompassing immersion notably, her one book led by a female character, The Little Friend, is told in third person. But part of that immersion involves a wilful blindness to the interiority of women. In a conversation with Camilla in The Secret History, Richard looks “at the side of her face, listening to the sweet, throaty cadences of her voice, when I was jolted from my musing by a sharp exclamation”. It’s almost funny: he’s not listening to her at all! Camilla is an unsatisfying, insubstantial ghost because Richard has no interest in what lies underneath her physical allure she is “the real mystery, the safe I could never crack”.Resisting the psychological pull of these unreliable narrators allows us glimpses of strange, complicated women Tartt knows down to their bones. Judy is kind and generous even with her parrot voice she takes care of Richard, offers advice and is revealed in the epilogue to be one of the more successful graduates of their college. Pippa has a life full of trauma that Theo actively avoids thinking about, while Xandra, his apparently ditzy stepmother, is one of the few people in The Goldfinch who knows exactly what he’s doing she just has no interest in intervening.It’s obviously Tartt’s narrators who are shallow when it comes to the women they meet, not the women themselves. But this means that we never get to wade into those waters either. We watch their turbulent seas from over the clifftop, permitted to glimpse but not to enter. In this context, Harriet becomes less a determined outsider to the ranks of women and more a tragedy waiting to happen, her perspective about to be immolated.At the same time, it is both undeniable and exhausting that if Camilla were the hero of The Secret History or Pippa the star of The Goldfinch, the novels would be very different, because women don’t move in the world the same way men do. Theo stumbles into the world of underground gangsters Richard spends a winter nearly freezing to death. Their lives aren’t easy, wrestling with trauma, class, loss and grief. But if they were women, there would be an additional layer of disadvantage they would have had to fight through just to tell the story in the first place. Perhaps they would have compensated by becoming “hard or quarrelsome”, as Richard worries about Camilla. Tartt’s characters are often working against a very ancient idea of fate, a dark thread set out for them to follow that they cannot ide themselves from. Undoubtedly, her clean, masterful novels would clutter quickly if you added the structural forces of misogyny alongside the ine.All the same, sometimes I wonder about the Tartt heroines we could have had. What if The Secret History was about five feral girls and their token boy instead, drinking gin straight and lying to the FBI in white linen and pince-nez, translating Greek to Latin and chasing after Dionysian mysteries? What if a female Theo Decker lost her mother too young and became a charming, girlish liar with an opiate addiction, a tendency towards panic attacks, and a sexily complicated relationship with her criminal best friend?Given the deeply thrumming awareness of women and narrative possibility that guides Tartt’s work, it’s hard to feel particularly worried. She produces a novel once every decade. I have hope for a heroine yet.• The Goldfinch is released on 27 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00f3bc5cdf64be60152a76c01a9dada92ffa3c89/0_233_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b8b2a94f688a7e4114f64955c48a6b","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It’s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other’s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning… Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a “major shout-out for the British Library’s crime series”:Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000:There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn’t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip is “marvellous, as you would expect from this author,” writes SydneyH:The main thing I’ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it – though there obviously wasn’t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America’s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn’t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn’t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it’s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.Pseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:… A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has ‘taken’. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I’m not far enough into it to talk about it’s meaning, etc, but so far it’s entertaining and thoughtful.We Don’t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore:A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.Vasily Grossman’s Stalingrad is “very long” says paulburns, but that “doesn’t matter”:It’s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various iniduals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I’m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.Finally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:It’s not as dark than others of hers I’ve read, which may be because it’s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there’s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson?Now I want to know too.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

As a result, it is going back to the drawing board and may ditch Monzo Plus altogether.The move is both a financial and PR blow for the company, which said recently that “there’s still plenty of work to do to get to profitability”.Monzo recently passed the 3-million customer mark and is particularly popular among millennials.Monzo Plus, which included features such as travel insurance and travel money, launched in April and was a key part of the company’s revenue strategy. The bank initially offered a discounted monthly fee of £3. Then in August it unveiled a range of bundles costing up to £12 a month. One bundle, called the Supporter, cost £4.95 a month and offered exclusive Monzo Plus merchandise such as water bottles and T-shirts, plus access to prize draws to win metal payment cards.But two weeks ago the bank admitted that, while a “significant number” of people had signed up for the Supporter package, “takeup of the new bundles isn’t what we’d hoped it would be” and it was therefore rethinking Monzo Plus.In the latest development, a post on Monzo’s community forum, appeared to admit that many customers had been unhappy. It said that following the announcement two weeks ago, “we’ve decided to go one step further and start from the very beginning”.One of the headings on the post reads: “New team, new product, new name?” Meanwhile, anyone clicking on the Monzo Plus section of the website will be met with a message saying it won’t be available for a while.Tom Davies, a product marketing manager, said in the post that anyone who had an subscription and wanted to cancel could do so by contacting customer support.He added: “If you’ve chosen our Supporter bundle, we’ll be automatically refunding the amount you’ve paid in fees, plus some interest, because you’re missing out on some of the features we offered.” This reflects the fact that the bank will not be sending out any “swag” or holding the prize draws."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf8a6d53573f4b6ddf63cb7817bd80c81611a840/0_0_2321_1392/master/2321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=008de614fe60140cbd98db983f9d26e4","title":"ryanair urge uk pilots to transfer overseas or face job losses","story":"Airline says numbers must be reduced at bases such as Stansted and ManchesterRyanair has written to UK pilots asking them to take unpaid leave or transfer to other bases abroad, saying they could otherwise join the 9,000 job losses at Thomas Cook.The airline, which reported profits of €1bn (£886m) in May, told its pilots that a “significant surplus of pilots must be reduced” at UK bases including Stansted and Manchester, and that it was encouraging them to take up to 12 months of unpaid leave.It said that there were limited vacancies for full-time pilots at bases in Morocco, Romania and Hungary.It blamed the delay to Boeing 737 Max deliveries for the decision. Ryanair had ordered up to 135 of the aircraft for its expansion plans, with the first planes due this year. The model remains grounded, however, since the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes.The memo came a week after UK pilots called off the remainder of a series of strikes this month. The pilots union, Balpa, had complained about Ryanair’s “abysmal approach to industrial relations” and said the dispute over pay and conditions was driven by resentment over a range of cost-saving measures used by Ryanair.Ryanair had called the strikes pointless and managed to operate the majority of its UK schedules by bringing in more contractors and pilots from overseas bases. The airline had warned of winter base closures across Europe.Last week, the chief executive, Michael O’Leary, was awarded a new pay package in which he could receive a €99m (£88m) bonus within five years, although almost half of Ryanair shareholders voted against it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78c86f69627bd4cb4abde781318ce64a2ed8ecfa/0_13_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccd8493b2f5956e6ab088dec571238db","title":"wrightbus goes into administration 1400 jobs routemaster northern ireland","story":"Collapse puts about 1,200 jobs at risk and is second major UK insolvency this weekThe maker of the revived Routemaster bus and one of Northern Ireland’s biggest employers has collapsed into administration – leading immediately to 1,200 redundancies.The failure of Wrightbus, which comes after a breakdown in 11th-hour rescue talks, represents the UK’s second significant insolvency of the week, following the demise of the holiday group Thomas Cook.The Ballymena-based engineering company had been scrambling to find a buyer.An expected sale evaporated at the end of last week when the Chinese engineering group Weichai and a firm led by the JCB heir, Jo Bamford, pulled out of talks. That double blow came days after the Northern Irish businessman Darren Donnelly also withdrew from making a potential bid for the firm.The original Routemaster bus was mostly withdrawn from service in London to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The original 1956 design was not accessible for wheelchair users, and was difficult for people with limited mobility or with pushchairs.Boris Johnson, then the Conservative mayoral candidate for London, announces he is contemplating introducing a modern-day Routemaster.Now elected mayor, Johnson announces the New Bus for London competition to design it. The requirements are for a low-floor red double-decker bus with at least one internal staircase, a rear open platform, and one other entranceexit with doors.Six manufacturers are invited to compete to design and build the new bus, with Northern Ireland-based vehicle manufacturer Wrightbus awarded the contract in December.\u0026nbsp The final design is unveiled the following May.Johnson drives an early prototype of his bus in a public demonstration.The new bus goes into service for the first time, on the No 38 route between Clapton and Victoria.Johnson commits to ordering 600 of the buses at an anticipated cost of about £160m.Modifications to the design of the rear doors mean the buses will be operated with only a driver, and the “hop onhop off” rear platform will be closed while the bus is not at a stop. This breaks Johnson’s election promise that the buses would be operated by two crew members and removes the unique “hop onhop off” flexibility the original Routemaster had brought to London’s streets, the main reason for introducing the new design.Tfl spends an additional £2m fitting opening windows on the top deck of the buses, which Londoner nicknamed ‘Roastmasters’ for how hot they get inside. Temperatures had been recorded as high as 32.5C, higher than the legal limit for transporting live cattle.Sadiq Khan, Johnson’s successor as London mayor, declines to order further new routemaster buses.A TfL response to n freedom of information request reveals that the total capital cost of the vehicles is about £346m - approximately £430,000 per bus, nearly double the cost of purchasing conventional buses.It is announced that Wrightbus, the bus manufacturer Johnson contracted to build the buses, is goes into administration.The accounting group Deloitte, which had been running the sales auction for the company, has now been appointed administrator for a collection of the businesses within the group, including Wrights Group, Wrightbus, Wright En-Drive, Wright Composites and Metallix.The firm’s collapse came after Boris Johnson told parliament his government would do everything it could to help Wrightbus. Ian Paisley, the MP for North Antrim, also told the  last week he believed the government had already demonstrated it could help the stricken manufacturer without breaching state aid rules by directing state-controlled companies to place orders with Wrightbus.However, a government source strenuously denied any such assurances had been given. A source close to the company’s board also denied government support had been offered.Michael Magnay, who is joint administrator, said: “We recognise the companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years.“The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.”The firms have about 1,250 employees and just 50 will remain to assist with the winding down if no buyer can be found.Paisley said: “Administration, I hope, offers an opportunity to attract a sale on amended terms to the last month’s negotiations. I can’t imagine a situation where Ballymena would be without its bus building company and I hope we can get this matter resolved quickly.”Workers dragged heavy toolboxes out of the factory after hearing the news. Gordon Mairs, who has been with the firm for 22 years, said many workers were angry with management.Ballymena has lost several major employers in recent years including the closure of sites operated by tyre maker Michelin and tobacco firm Gallaher.“Boris Johnson as his hobby makes buses out of wooden crates. What he needs to do is stop with his hobby and engage now straight away in a rescue plan to save these jobs and save this area. What future is there for young people in Ballymena?”Unite added that it estimated a further 1,700 jobs were at risk in the supply chain. One Wrightbus supplier said: “There’s going to be a lot of debt out there. There’s a lot of local suppliers. For Ballymena and everything it’s not good.”Sir William Wright, Jeff Wright’s father and the head of the family owners of Wrightbus, advocated Britain leaving the EU during the 2016 referendum. He also nominated Paisley as the Democratic Unionist party’s Westminster candidate. The DUP is a staunch backer of Brexit.The parent company of Wrights Group also donated more than £16.1m to charity between 2012 and 2017. Those donations helped to fund the expansion of Green Pastures, an influential evangelical church in Ballymena run by Jeff Wright .Workers said they planned to protest at the church on Sunday. Lee Kyle, who has 17 years’ experience of coach building at Wrightbus, said: “I think it’s disgusting. There’s 1,200 people put out of work because of the church. The men are destroyed. This is all they know since school. Where do they go?”Following the donations, Wrightbus has increasingly been struggling with its finances and made two rounds of redundancies last year, with 95 jobs going in  February and June. It had recent sales successes, including a Transport for London order in May for 20 hydrogen-powered buses, which each cost about £500,000 and only emit water as exhaust.However, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, cancelled further purchases of the New Routemasters in 2016, which had been launched with a huge fanfare when Johnson was running the capital in 2012.The UK bus market has since slowed. Operators have taken a cautious approach to new orders after ordering a large number of vehicles in recent years to meet stricter emissions standards.In its last set of accounts, for the 12 months to December 2017, Wrights Group made sales of £227m and a profit of £1.5m – down from £264m and £10.7m on the year before. The financial position of the company is thought to have deteriorated significantly since the last financial update.Before the potential bidders pulled out of talks last week, the company had raised staff hopes that a deal was imminent. On Thursday, Wrightbus management told employees it was “now in a race to complete a final deal with credible bidders”.It added: “This ongoing business and its employees are our number one priority and we are confident that a positive outcome can be delivered over the next few days.”Wrights Group did not comment.Workers at Wrightbus are not the only employees in the Northern Irish manufacturing industry who have faced the loss of their jobs in recent years. Despite unemployment hitting record lows, work has stopped at some of the region’s industrial icons, taking away well-salaried jobs.Harland and WolffThe historic Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic was placed in administration last month, threatening the jobs of 140 workers. Harland and Wolff’s distinctive yellow cranes form the backdrop to the capital’s skyline, but workers still hope that the yard could be saved from permanent closure.Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace company, put its Belfast operations up for sale in May as part of a wider restructuring. In June, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries bought the company’s regional jet fuselage manufacturing arm, which carries out work in Belfast. However, a buyer has yet to be found for the rest of the Belfast business, descended from the pioneering Short Brothers, which makes wings and fuselages for aircraft such as the Airbus A220.Production at Michelin’s tyre plant in Ballymena ended in 2018, costing 860 jobs. The French company cited a downturn in demand for truck tyres in Europe after the financial crisis for its decision, while relatively high energy costs made the plant less competitive than other factories. Local politicians sought to attract luxury carmaker Aston Martin to take on the plant but Ballymena lost out to a site in Wales.Japan Tobacco International announced the closure of the Gallaher’s cigarette plant in Ballymena in 2014, amid a decline in the number of European smokers. The final closure came in 2017 but Wrightbus took over the Gallaher’s site, initially providing some hope to the local economy before Wednesday’s closure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a15a22e148defc5a980551f92098c299f9dee89/0_198_5074_3045/master/5074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c328b33af7c1739f17da108335f642","title":"try before you buy german city offers workers a free one month stay","story":"Picturesque Görlitz is offering free lodging and studio space in exchange for feedback on what potential residents want from a cityLast year Eva Bodenmüller read about a city in eastern Germany inviting people to live there for a month for free. She and her partner Carsten Borck, an artist, knew they had to leave their residence in Italy soon and weren’t looking forward to moving back to their native Berlin.“I thought: ‘Why not Görlitz?’” said Bodenmüller, a freelance journalist .Görlitz, Germany’s easternmost city, is a well-preserved gem that has played the part of quaint Mitteleuropean burg in Hollywood films from The Grand Budapest Hotel to Inglourious Basterds to The Reader. But its pastel-coloured old town, which draws 140,000 tourists a year, hides a darker reality.City officials decided they needed to do something to reverse this trend, and hit upon the idea of offering a free one-month stay, no strings attached.Other cities had already been experimenting with the idea of luring new residents by offering to cover their housing. Detroit was the first big city to try it, launching an innovative programme of paying promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year, and today the idea is being used everywhere from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, which offers $10,000 to digital workers to move there for a year.The proportion of workers who conduct their business remotely is growing. Already, millions of people spend much of their adult lives hopscotching from one place to another, perhaps including the occasional work-tourism visit to Medellín or Tokyo. The officials behind Görlitz’s programme figured it could both attract some of those nomadic workers and give them the chance to learn some lessons on how to reverse its population decline.“When we applied we thought the project was about convincing people to move to Görlitz,” Borck said over borscht at a restaurant overlooking the Neisse River. “But now we have the feeling it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after these four weeks or not. We’re just the laboratory mice for this science experiment.”The Görlitz-based Interdisciplinary Centre for Ecological and Revitalising Urban Transformation (IZS), which is overseeing Testing the City, as the federally funded project is known, received more than 150 applications. Two-thirds were from larger cities, and several came from outside Germany, including from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the US and the UK.The 54 iniduals and groups participating are singles, couples and families ranging from their 20s to 60s, including digital entrepreneurs, a film-maker, a model, visual artists and musicians. Each is assigned to one of three project-maintained apartments and offered free use of one of three spaces for work.Though the municipality hopes that some will permanently relocate to Görlitz, the main intention is for ISZ to use participant interviews and questionnaires to inform a national urban development policy to help revive Germany’s smaller cities. “Our aim is to learn more about what people need, and if they move, what is their motivation,” said IZS head Robert Knippschild.Görlitz is a fascinating place to test these theories. The city has around 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is a third higher than the national average. This, in part, is why Görlitz has taken in 1,200 refugees. But surveys have shown immigration to be the most urgent issue for residents of eastern Germany, where the far right has taken hold.“It was a tough campaign,” said Ursu, a Romanian immigrant who played lead trumpet in the local philharmonic orchestra before turning to politics. He says he wants to put the animosity of the election in the past, and sees Testing the City as part of a budding revival which includes a new data analysis centre employing 120 scientists and engineers, a Siemens hydrogen technologies innovation campus that will employ another 100, and a €36m (£32m) facelift for the art nouveau municipal hall.Ursu believes the key to creating jobs is a more welcoming society. “I’ve said to the people, you must think about whether you want to have an open city, a European city, or a closed city,” he said.This is not a settled question in Görlitz. A July report on the project by the German news outlet Deutsche Welle attracted sharp comments online. “The incentive to lure you here is just the desperate attempt of our city to fight the shrinking population,” said YouTube user Polter Geist. “They hope your leftwing alternative garbage will appeal to the youth.”During their stay, Bodenmüller and Borck have sought to engage with these issues directly. Borck staged a show of his work at the Europa Haus gallery, with posters asking passersby questions such as “Am I welcome here?” and “How do I know you are not a Nazi?”.The couple said they spent a lot of time talking to locals and found a city of extremes. “In other places you generally have people from different groups talking to each other,” said Bodenmüller, who has lived in Berlin, Munich and several smaller towns. “But here there is no centre – there are just the two sides.”Another project participant, Nikolas Kammerer, 34, a photographer from Leipzig, sees the locals as one of the city’s main draws. He found it refreshing that artists and creative workers in Görlitz are not looking to become YouTube stars or Instagram influencers, but instead are laser-focused on producing and collaborating. He credits his month in the city for his first successful commission for the German news outlet Die Zeit: a portrait series of local voters on election day. “In Leipzig I probably wouldn’t have done this,” he said.He also saw the other perspective, at a far-right election rally where the AfD candidate denounced foreigners as criminals and the crowd chanted “Lugen Presse!” (“lying press!”). “It was horrible,” said Kammerer, whose grandmother is from Görlitz. “Most of these far-right people don’t want to talk to the media, which is a problem because I want to have them represented in my work.”With the project about halfway through, four participants have committed to move to Görlitz, including German-Finnish poet Mark Mallon and his wife, Finnish artist Venla Saalo. The couple decided to leave Berlin because of its traffic, pollution and high rents, and settled in Görlitz in April. “Görlitz feels like a lively town with a lot of young people, students, opportunities, empty spaces, and on the other hand peace and remoteness,” they said. “It is a great combination for creative work.”Borck and Bodenmüller like the cheap rents and high density of organic grocery stores and vegetarian restaurants but wish Görlitz had better regional transport and more open-mindedness. They also wished they had more time there.“It’s very intense, to try to meet people, learn the city and do our work in just four weeks,” said Bodenmüller. “If we could stay here longer, we could leave and come back and have a better chance to understand the city.”Knippschild’s early conclusions from the pilot project suggest that cultural offerings and leisure activities are crucial to attracting nomadic workers, as are reliable travel connections and good housing.“People are taking the project seriously, thinking about which phase of life they are in and what they need in terms of housing and living,” he said of the participants. “This is giving us a great deal of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Görlitz.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70131044a906eaf9750e7c9a6101944a810b2ae0/0_2196_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11ab2a57c3366cce530673d8766fcb18","title":"what lies beneath the craze for selfeets of eye catching floors","story":"Cities on Instagram: Hundreds of thousands of people have shared striking floor designs – sometimes from unusual placesFrom brightly patterned tiles to intricate mosaics, sometimes beauty is right under our feet.Hundreds of thousands of Instagrammers have shared photos of eye-catching floors using the #ihavethisthingwithfloors hashtag.

During the campaign’s final weeks, families watched as the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu launched ferocious tirades about the threat of a “leftist-Arab government”. He told his followers the Arabs “want to annihilate us all”, and that they were “stealing” the elections through rampant voter fraud (his legislative attempts to place surveillance cameras at Arab polling stations failed to get through the Knesset).Tira’s residents were no strangers to the prime minister’s history of racist incitement, but for many people his shocking escalations compelled a response. If they couldn’t stop him from winning, they thought, they would at least try to make his job as difficult as possible.Traditionally, Arab parties have refused to nominate an Israeli prime minister – their last recommendation was for Yitzhak Rabin in 1992, who went on to sign the Oslo accords with Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization. But in a historic and controversial move on Sunday, Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, formally recommended to President Reuven Rivlin that Benny Gantz, leader of the centre-right Blue and White party, be appointed to form the next government. Only one of the List’s factions, the nationalist party Balad, withheld its support. Had Odeh declined to nominate Gantz, the task was more likely to be assigned to Netanyahu again. (At Rivlin’s urging, the two leaders have now begun talks about forming a unity government.)These surprising developments have been praised as major steps towards “integrating” Palestinian citizens into national politics and reigniting the opposition to increasingly hard-right rule. But such claims are seriously flawed. Like much of Israeli politics over the past decade, the value placed on Palestinian voting power has been centred almost exclusively on one issue: ousting Netanyahu. There has been little engagement in Israel or abroad with the community’s larger policy concerns, which include stopping home demolitions and land seizures, eradicating gun violence in Arab towns, revoking dozens of discriminatory laws and ending the occupation of the Palestinian territories. And yet as the Palestinian writer and feminist activist Samah Salaime put it, the Israeli centre-left now thinks that it is the responsibility of Palestinians “to take Bibi down – as second-class citizens, but first-class voters”.This narrow narrative, which the Joint List itself often resorts to, reduces Palestinian citizens to pawns in a competition between Jewish political elites, whose differences have more to do with personality than policy. It’s not just that Blue and White’s platform mirrors Likud in nearly all but name: Gantz and his partner, Yair Lapid, have repeatedly derided the Joint List as extremists who don’t represent their constituents, and have rejected the conditions put forward by Odeh for backing Gantz’s candidacy – conditions ranging from recognising dozens of Bedouin villages in the Negev to cancelling the Jewish nation-state law, which reflect the basic needs and rights of Palestinian citizens. “Centre-left” Zionist parties, such as the Democratic Union and Labour-Gesher, have also shifted rightwards in many of their positions: the two-state solution, once the centre-left’s flagship agenda, is no longer a priority.Given this ide, Arab parties usually prefer to stay out of the Jewish majority’s leadership battles. But with today’s competing blocs neck-and-neck, with Palestinian national politics severely fragmented and with Palestinian citizens demanding results from their infighting leaders, the Joint List found itself between a rock and a hard place.Removing Netanyahu and disrupting the rightwing’s decade-long hold on power could provide many strategic benefits to Palestinian citizens – a path that appears to be endorsed by most of the community, who are feeling the brunt of the government’s increasingly harmful policies. But to do this, they must back Gantz, a former army chief who boasted of bombing Gaza “back to the stone age”, and who declared that he would only sit with coalition partners who were “Jewish and Zionist” – echoing the racist politics of the very rival he is trying to depose. Palestinians are damned if the List steps away and allows Netanyahu’s return, and they are damned if it steps in and offers Gantz a path to power.By opting for the latter, the List has taken a gamble that is already polarising Palestinian opinion, and which could backfire devastatingly if a unity government is formed. Regardless of what unfolds, the obsession with Netanyahu’s fate must shift to the bigger problem at the heart of Israeli politics. Despite differing ideologies, Palestinian citizens remain united around a core political consensus: full equality and social justice for all, and an end to the military occupation. These pillars – which would be basic values in any other part of the world – are still viewed by most Jewish-Israeli parties and voters as uncomfortable at best and an existential threat at worst. That makes the Joint List, despite its numerous flaws, the only truly progressive party in Israel.But as long as Israel’s “democracy” is predicated on accepting racial primacy and disenfranchising millions, it won’t matter how many parliamentary seats the List can muster – its “first-class voters” will remain second-class citizens.• Amjad Iraqi is a contributing editor at +972 Magazine and a policy analyst at Al-Shabaka"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a3e18888f1d750765def6cdcb1c38d250037f1a/0_129_3251_1950/master/3251.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1454b6cfe11a5e8069e424d287a4dfc4","title":"the guardian view on brexit politics arsenic in the water supply","story":"Britain is five weeks away from the ruinous and dangerous position of leaving the European Union without a deal. There is no sign of the country having made any progress towards getting one. Boris Johnson did not meet the 30-day deadline set by Angela Merkel to come up with an alternative solution to replace the Irish backstop to resolve the Brexit impasse with the European Union. This week he suffered a devastating judicial blow in the supreme court over an attempt to suspend parliament for an unprecedented five weeks at a time of political crisis to evade scrutiny. In a worrying sign of how far the Tory party has embraced radical populism, its MPs responded by calling for the court to be abolished. And instead of remorse Mr Johnson offered offence in parliament, couching his bluster in the jingoistic terms of “betrayal”, “surrender” and “sabotage”. Mr Johnson touched a new low by besmirching the memory of the murdered MP Jo Cox.Mr Johnson, like his predecessor Theresa May, describes Brexit as the will of the British people. It isn’t – not least because there was no shared vision as to what “leave” actually meant – but the language is designed to remove dissent, and any acknowledgment of erse voices and views. The contraction of Brexit and the national interest has curdled and soured British politics. While the result deserves respect, almost half the country opposed it. During the referendum campaign Mr Johnson, a prominent leaver, did not engage in a deliberative, honest and respectful argument with opponents – a historic failure in light of the gravity of the decision. In office he has continued to offer insouciance and belligerence.In his book Beyond Brexit, Vernon Bogdanor warns that in leaving the EU, Britain could again become a country with no legal remedy for breaches of human rights. At present, when courts make a declaration of incompatibility between convention rights and British law, ministers act to put things right. That might not be the case in the years ahead. We could become a “paradise for an overweening executive”. Brexit populism is pouring arsenic into the water supply of our national conversation. Brexit raised questions that it cannot answer because it identified problems that politicians did not recognise and were unprepared to solve. They should start.

Like Abraham Lincoln’s revered speech, which ran to 273 words, Thunberg’s was also very short, only 495 words long.Lincoln famously spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg Cemetery, following the leading orator of the day, Edward Everett, who took two hours to deliver the official address, a 13,000 word oration. Lincoln’s speech, simply described in the day’s official program as Dedicatory Remarks, lasted less than three minutes.Thunberg would similarly have had some good acts to follow at a UN talk-fest, but her presence would not, at first glance, seem to be of the same significance as those of the various world leaders who had gathered for the event.And yet it is Thunberg’s speech, which took just four-and-a-half minutes to deliver, which, one suspects, will resonate long into the future.In the manner that was then traditional, Everett’s marathon speech, deemed very good by the standards of the day, was rich with classical allusion. But Lincoln used no classical reference. Instead, in a way that it is hard to appreciate from this distance of time, he was profoundly modern, using Biblical phrasing and rhythms that appealed to a population for whom the Book was the word, not Sophocles.Thunberg’s speech was similarly phrased in the contemporary argot pitched to the polarising force of social media’s algorithms, suffused with a contained rage. For she came not with a dream, but a nightmare, the scientific truth of climate change succinctly put in five paragraphs. Her dreams, she said, had been stolen from her along with her childhood.Thunberg’s speech used phrases and ideas she has deployed before and to better effect. So too Lincoln. But what gives both speeches their enormous power is timing, each coming after historic events the significance of which had not yet been fully understood and was still in the process of creation.In Lincoln’s case it was the Battle of Gettysburg that had taken place a few months earlier, now regarded as a turning point in the civil war. In Thunberg’s case it was the massive global strike of schoolchildren a few days earlier inspired by her original, solitary strike on the steps of the Swedish parliament.Lincoln’s speech sought to give meaning to the enormous blood sacrifice of the Battle of Gettysburg, and the war more generally in doing so he was shaping the future of the war and his nation.Thunberg’s singular achievement was to present the climate change issue as a battle for power. In doing so she spoke with the authority of the millions who marched only a few days before. For this Donald Trump trolled her. He intuited her power and tried to destroy it through mockery.In her speech Thunberg sets up an opposition between the plural we – those who want action on climate change – and a strangely singular use of the word you – those who don’t.And though she was speaking to an audience largely composed of those with power, her you was not only the assembled global leaders but everyone, and her we, while directly referring to the young and Friday’s three million marchers, was a we open to all, infinitely expandable.For the you is not just Trump or Scott Morrison or a fossil fuel company executive. Her you is personal. It is each of us who hears but as if in a nightmare cannot act. Will you recognise the necessity of the enormous task which must start now, or will you say nothing, do nothing, condemning yourself to the ranks of those who the future “will never forgive”?On Wednesday the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the nation’s creepy gaslighter-in-chief, criticised Thunberg for similar reasons to Trump, saying, “I think we’ve got to caution against raising the anxieties of children in our country.”Since 1996 – seven years before Greta Thunberg was born – the Liberal party has been working assiduously to advance the cause of fossil fuel companies at the expense of our future. Morrison’s paternalistic piffle is just one more piece of grotesque bad faith on an issue about which the Liberal record is one of lying, scheming and wrecking at every step for over two decades. With his bluster of quiet Australians, Morrison is trying to pull a spit hood over the nation to silence us all.Recently released Australian cabinet papers reveal the Howard Liberal government was conspicuously campaigning in 1996 against legally binding, uniform emission reduction targets in the Kyoto protocol, with the prime minister’s advocacy to key world leaders proving “influential”. When uniform targets were eventually dropped, the Liberal cabinet praised John Howard’s negotiating strategy.“Australia is in a special position,” the cabinet papers record Howard saying. “We are a developed country that is a major exporter of energy.”And so it went for the next two decades. With the Liberals and the Murdoch press running political cover, the fossil fuel industries ramped up and up. By 2019 the Liberal party had defined itself as the party of coal, and a craven Labor party, after its defeat in the most recent election, is now following its lead. Today Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and LNG, and over the next decade Australia hopes to double its coal production. In consequence Australia is well on the way to becoming a pariah state along with the likes of Russia and Saudi Arabia, its people hostage to the profits of its fossil fuel industry.The gross corruption of Australian public life so recently on display with examples of large sums of money from the Chinese Communist party seeming to flow into both Liberal and Labor coffers show exactly how easily purchased an enfeebled and unresponsive Australian democracy has become. And the corollary, the shameful, shared refusal of both Labor and Liberal parties to back a much-needed national corruption commission suggests only the obvious: the depth and breadth of corruption of our national polity.And yet while avoiding the criminality among their own, our leaders have been keen to criminalise those who actively campaign for our future. Queensland – the epicentre for major new coalmines – has significantly strengthened its laws against environmental protesters while lawyers for the Adani mine have publicly stated that they will seek to bankrupt any opponents of their new coalmine, the most controversial in the world, commercially viable only with the subsidies and tax breaks given for its consumption by the Indian government and for its production by Australian governments.When Morrison infamously brandished a lump of coal in parliament he told Australians not to be scared.But we should be.Australia is already living the grim consequences of climate change. If the world continues on its present trajectory, much of mainland Australia is predicted to be uninhabitable within 80 years. The climate collapse is here.For over 30 years those who wished for action on climate change have believed that reason and truth would persuade those with power to act. But it is not so, and it did not prove to be so, and therein lies much of the reason carbon levels continue to rise and the planet’s very future is today hanging by the thinnest of threads.For power never gives to reason. Power bends only to power. And on Monday a schoolgirl raised the spectre of an opposing power that is now rising around the world and which will not be satisfied by those “who can only talk about money and fairytales of eternal economic growth”.“The young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you … We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.”Watching Greta Thunberg’s speech I understood what last Friday was about: a historic turning point where for the first time the power of we met the power of you without artifice, without compromise and with a ferocious courage.Millions marched last Friday. The next march will be bigger. The battle lines are finally clear. And each of us must now decide: am I you or am I we?

His vibrantly coloured, intricately detailed but always wearable clothes have earned him a devoted customer base who have kept him afloat through the vagaries of trends. Christian Lacroix, 68, founded his fashion house one year later, in 1987. His star burned brightly for two decades in which his flamboyant dresses starred on red carpets and magazine covers, until losses forced him to shutter the house in 2009.Christian Lacroix no longer owns his trademark, and his name has not appeared at fashion week for a decade. The first hint that Dries Van Noten’s show was to be out of the ordinary was the red rose that had been placed on each seat, with a ribbon tag signed DVN*XCLX.Back when Christian Lacroix staged fashion shows, the audience would throw roses on to the catwalk when he made his bow during the finale, a ritual taken from the bullfights of Lacroix’s native Arles. The setting for this show was straight out of Van Noten’s understated playbook – a minimalist, poured-concrete space at the modernist Opera Bastille – but when the first model appeared, she wore in her hair a large black feather, another tradition remembered from Lacroix’s own fashion shows.Polka dots were followed by flamenco ruffles, and then a chartreuse opera coat gathered with festoon swagging. There were fuchsia taffeta trousers with waterfall hems. By the time exit 41 appeared – a blood-red matador jacket with gold embroidery – the closely guarded secret of a co-collection was becoming clear. The two men took their bow together at the end of the show.Van Noten said of the collaboration that he had found himself “needing exuberance, opulence, another volume and fun”.“I was constantly drawn to the 80s and 90s, to a love of dressing up, to couture, to beauty, to audacity – to joy. I quickly realised that all roads seemed to lead to the work and world - of Mr Christian Lacroix. So I thought why not just phone him, why not phone Christian and ask if he would be up for the challenge and enjoy working with me on a collection. I was so happy when he immediately said yes.”The two designers, who have spent the past five months working together, stood shoulder to shoulder as they accepted congratulations and posed for photos with their arms around each other. Christian Lacroix, who has had a successful career designing for the opera and ballet in the decade since his last haute couture show, was visibly emotional to be back in the fashion throng.The cloak-and-dagger secrecy and the surprise “drop” of the collection was a smart trick. Van Noten and Lacroix won the news cycle of fashion week and the stunt ensured that this collaboration will resonate on the social media feeds of millennials for whom the 20th-century glory days of Lacroix are ancient history. And by having the first few outfits pass as Van Noten before the realisation occurred to most of those in the audience, the show illustrated how surprisingly close Van Noten’s more cerebral, Belgian-trained aesthetic is to Lacroix’s flamboyant, Mediterranean-facing maximalism. In their painterly sense of colour and passion for drama in fashion, they are kindred spirits. The collaboration, which is understood to be a one-off for this season, was a celebration of “mutual admiration”, Van Noten’s spokesman said.

Adventurous writer-director Caspar Seale Jones has relocated a stock horror starting point – fraught young woman fleeing something abominable in her past – to Japan, which instantly gifts his frames more distinctive vistas than all those potboilers pursuing teenagers through the streets of Peterborough or Stroud. More intriguingly, To Tokyo is in that Japanese folk-horror tradition that yielded Onibaba and Kwaidan, making merry-macabre use of a still relatively unfamiliar set of demons and ghouls.To Tokyo scores high on dreamy-bordering-on-nightmarish atmosphere. On learning her mother is gravely ill, Alice (Florence Kosky) passes into either a fugue state or an actual wilderness that encompasses forests, deserts and a mountainside hut where she slaps on warpaint and receives offerings of fruit and entrails from whatever dragged her there. For half its running time, To Tokyo is just Kosky, some spectacular landscapes (cinematographer Ralph Messer apparently taking notes from that visual whizz Tarsem Singh) and a properly creepy spectre. Seale Jones makes the bold, rewarding decision not to explain a damn thing. The result is a masterclass in show-don’t-tell cinema.Even when Alice reaches the bright lights of Tokyo, the depopulated backstreets and coldly indifferent skyscrapers are eerie and unsettling: it’s as though what came before was a dry run for the worst civilisation has to offer. Any interpretation will be yours, but there’s a fairytale logic to it, and the action is anchored by Seale Jones’s remarkably assured image-making and a performance of intense hollow-eyed persistence by Kosky. Self-evidently a first feature – running to just 75 minutes – it nevertheless serves as a striking and effective calling card. How encouraging it is to see an emergent British film-maker reaching for the uncanny and mysterious, rather than settling for hackneyed or humdrum.• To Tokyo is released in the UK on 27 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bbfc3e4e54c6eccae9559b88ee613a888e45aab/0_2270_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca63f123584df73df98b0e7bd750176f","title":"20 best easy autumn recipes yottam ottolenghi rory oconnell","story":"Yotam Ottolenghi’s comforting curried egg and cauliflower salad and Dan Lepard’s cinnamon cake – more of our favourite seasonal dishesThere is a great joy to be had from the mere mention of a chicken pie.

Stir this well and place a lid on top, lifting to stir from time to time, and let the vegetables cook, steaming until soft and bright.Meanwhile, heat a wide frying pan, add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the chicken legs until gently golden, then add them to the vegetables.Pour in the wine and stock, add the herb posy and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, and place the lid atop and let cook for 45 minutes over the gentlest heat. When the meat is just cooked, turn off the heat and leave to cool, then lift the chicken out and carefully pick the meat from the bones and add back into the pot.Stir the pot of vegetables and chicken and taste for seasoning. Remove the bundle of herbs and the bay leaves. Add the chopped parsley and the finely grated zest of lemon. Mix all this together very well but not so much as to break the meat into smaller pieces.Heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4 and fill a handsome pie dish with the chicken and vegetables.

Crack the egg into a cup and beat with a fork and then add the milk, then brush liberally over the pastry.

Jeremy Lee is the chef-proprietor of Quo Vadis, London W1Pheasant is generally speaking, excellent value for money. The lean birds can be a little dry so I like to casserole-roast them, finding the result juicier, and with the addition of a few robust flavours, the bird is almost self-saucing.When buying a pheasant, choose the plumpest-looking bird. The addition of cinnamon may seem a little odd, but it adds a delicious scent to the cooking juices. The savoy cabbage puree can be made ahead of time and gently reheated later.Serves 2 savoy cabbage puree serves 4-6rind-less fat streaky bacon 100g olive oil 1 tbsp plump pheasant 1 red wine 150ml, eg cabernet sauvignontinned or bottled tomatoes 100g, finely choppedcinnamon stick ½ rosemary 1 sprig, about 6cm longsea salt and freshly ground black pepperbutter 25g (optional)For the savoy cabbage pureesavoy cabbage 1 head water 1.75 litres sea salt and freshly ground black pepperregular or double cream 25-40ml salted butter 25-40gPreheat the oven at 180Cgas mark 4. Cut the bacon into fine lardons, about 3cm long and 5mm thick. Heat a heavy casserole on a gentle heat until quite hot. Add the olive oil and then the bacon, stirring it regularly with a wooden spoon and allowing it to become slightly crisp and golden. Remove from the casserole and leave to drain on kitchen paper.Dry the breast of the pheasant and place it, breast side down, in the fat remaining in the casserole. Cook gently until the breast is golden. Do not try to rush this stage of the recipe, otherwise you may burn the casserole, in which case the flavour of the sauce at the end will be spoiled. Remove the pheasant from the pan and pour off the excess fat. Replace the casserole on a low heat and add the wine, tomatoes, cinnamon, rosemary and bacon. Place the pheasant on top and season with salt and pepper. Place a piece of greaseproof paper and a tight-fitting lid on the casserole and cook in the oven for 1 hour.For the savoy cabbage puree, remove any damaged outside leaves from the cabbage. However, don’t remove any more of those nice green outside leaves than is necessary, as they are full of flavour and will give lovely bright green flecks to the finished puree. Place the cabbage on a chopping board and cut directly down through the middle of the head, then quarter and remove the hard core. Slice the cabbage against the grain, nice and thinly.Bring the water to the boil and salt well. Add the cabbage and cook uncovered at a simmer until it is just tender. Strain the cabbage well, reserving 100ml of the cooking water. In a blender or using a handheld blender, blend to a coarse puree, adding cream and butter as you see fit. The consistency should be like that of a soft mashed potato. If the puree is a bit firm, add a little of the reserved cooking water to soften it and blend briefly again. Taste and correct the seasoning and serve in a hot dish. A non-stick pan is perfect for reheating it, and a little of the reserved cooking water can be used if the puree has thickened in the meantime.When the bird is cooked, remove the casserole from the oven and reduce the temperature to 100Cgas mark ¼. Put the pheasant on a dish, cover it with greaseproof paper, and put it back into the oven to keep warm. Place the casserole on a gentle heat and bring the juices to a simmer. Taste and decide if the liquid needs to reduce a little to concentrate the flavour. If it already tastes delicious, you are ready to go. I sometimes swirl a little butter into the juices at this stage, just to give the sauce a little more body – however, the sauce should not become too thick and strong.Carve the pheasant neatly and serve with the bubbling sauce and the savoy cabbage puree.From Master It: How to Cook Today by Rory O’Connell (Fourth Estate, £16.99)This is one of the lightest cakes you’ll make with wholemeal flour, but it depends on both beating the eggs to a thick froth and adding a little baking powder.

It was a fine way for the 18-year-old to celebrate his new five-year deal and the latest in a growing list of reasons for Frank Lampard to give thanks to Chelsea’s flourishing academy.There were plenty of positives as Lampard collected his first home win as Chelsea manager. Chelsea had six youth players on the pitch and four more on the bench by the end of this 7-1 romp, with Ian Maatsen and Tino Anjorin coming on their debuts midway through the second half. Billy Gilmour, bright and inventive in midfield, caught the eye on his first start. Marc Guehi, only 19, belied his tender years with an assured debut in central defence. And Reece James, the youngster tipped to take César Azpilicueta’s place at right-back one day, introduced himself to the first team with a lovely goal, curling in a precise shot from 25 yards with eight minutes left.But Lampard, whose side host Manchester United in the fourth round, wants more. He was unhappy that Chelsea missed a chance to keep their first clean sheet of the season and his analysis even included criticism of Hudson-Odoi’s performance in the first half. Lampard said that the left winger, grasping for sharpness on his return from a serious achilles injury, had ignored instructions to run behind Grimsby’s defence. Strong words were required in the dressing room at half-time.Yet Hudson-Odoi grew into the game in the second half, as did Christian Pulisic on the opposite flank, and Lampard would also heap generous praise on his youngsters. “The two young lads improved the team when they came on,” Chelsea’s manager said.“Billy Gilmour ran the game from midfield. Marc Guehi was solid. The opportunities are there but now the hard work really begins to get in there regularly.”Amid the focus on the kids there was also encouragement for some of Lampard’s more experienced players. Four minutes had passed when Ross Barkley fizzed a low drive inside McKeown’s near post. The hosts built on Barkley’s first goal of the season three minutes later, a deflected cross from James reaching Michy Batshuayi, who grabbed his first goal for Chelsea since January 2018 with a sharp finish.However the League Two side halved the deficit in the 19th minute, exposing Chelsea’s defensive frailties when Kurt Zouma allowed a long punt to squeeze through to Matt Green, whose venomous shot sent the noisy travelling contingent wild.Lampard called Grimsby’s goal a disaster but Chelsea continued to dominate, earning a penalty when Green fouled Zouma. This time, however, spot-kick duties did not fall to Barkley, who missed from 12 yards against Valencia last week. Pedro stepped up to send McKeown the wrong way. “The good thing in my job is I can choose who does things and I chose Pedro to be captain and take a penalty tonight,” Lampard said.A fourth goal arrived when James conjured a brilliant assist, jabbing a cross into the six-yard box with the outside of his right boot. Zouma prodded in from close range.James looked the part after returning from an ankle injury. “Reece’s performances last year at Wigan, in the team of the year in the Championship, showed the talent he’s got,” Lampard said. “He’s got a great player and person to look up to in Azpilicueta. It’s just the start for Reece.” The best was yet to come from the 19-year-old, who made it 5-1 in the 82nd minute. Pulisic also became more of an influence, creating Batshuayi’s second, and there was still time for Hudson-Odoi, twisting and turning on the left, to round off a comprehensive win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06dc83cee49b0360a9dcdb0b0f6711390f8da8aa/0_158_2375_1425/master/2375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=083ef001ca9ee79adc92c6344e3d7fc3","title":"manchester city lugano womens champions league match report","story":"Janine Beckie and Pauline Bremer rose to the challenge of leading the line for Manchester City in the absence of the injured England trio Ellen White, Georgia Stanway and Lauren Hemp.

And it’s great to make Nick’s job harder.”It was always going to be routine for City with a six-goal cushion, courtesy of their 7-1 defeat of the Swiss side on the road, and with ‘Janine, Janine’ ringing round the ground to the tune of Blondie’s ‘Denis’, the 949 fans made sure they would enjoy progressing further than they did last year, when they went out to unseeded Atlético Madrid.“I’m really pleased,” said Cushing, when asked of Bremer and Beckie’s goals. “In previous years we’ve assembled a squad where we’ve known our XI and had maybe seven or eight players we can call upon in some games.“Last year and this year we’ve assembled a squad where we’ve got consistency across the board.”It took just five minutes for City to dash any meagre hopes of a comeback, Keira Walsh threading a pass to Beckie who dinked it smoothly over Morgan Bertsch from just inside the box. After the half-hour City doubled their lead. Cushing gave chances to the Ireland youngster Tyler Toland and the 17-year-old Jess Park, who both impressed, but it was the more experienced Walsh and Beckie partnership that would give the manager the option of resting a few more legs. Walsh broke to the byline before slipping a cross across the face of goal for Beckie to poke in.Cushing was full of praise for Walsh: “I will not hold back, she is up there with the most intelligent players I have worked with. She is pivotal for us.”This was much more comfortable for City. The Nationalliga A runners-up Lugano have become an unlikely home for former US college players. They have 16 Americans in their ranks and 10 were in the starting line up to face City, with English defender Helen Seed the outlier (she too, though, played NCAA football).Former NWSL player Beckie was the difference for City, and just two minutes after the break she had her third. A weak attempt at a clearance fell kindly at Beckie’s feet and the Canadian turned and powered a shot high past Bertsch. Bremer added a fourth, and her seventh in all competitions, when she carried the ball from deep, rounded Bertsch and prodded towards goal as she slipped to the ground."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bec26238f766f5acb52b934fcd297903cbc98cf7/0_35_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8df6539a4685bce137683b455137e3f6","title":"manchster united rochdale carabao cup match report","story":"Manchester United squeezed through to the Carabao Cup fourth round, 5-3 on penalties, Daniel James confidently dispatching the decisive kick on a night when Rochdale gave Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s men an almighty scare.Yet the result should not mask the latest worrying display, one that followed Saturday’s defeat at West Ham, as they were taken to spot-kicks by a 16-year-old right-back named Luke Matheson. He will long remember his 76th-minute equaliser and sprint to celebrate in front of the Rochdale fans he had sent into ecstasy.Matheson, an A-level student, will be 17 next week but it was United’s own 17-year-old, Mason Greenwood, whose earlier strike appeared to have won the tie. United then drew Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the next round and the manager said: “If you want to win it you have to beat the best.”Solskjær had retained only Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Andreas Pereira from the West Ham loss. The headline inclusion was Axel Tuanzebe who, at 21, captained United in only a 10th appearance. He was the youngest to do so since a 20-year-old Norman Whiteside in 1985. This was despite Paul Pogba’s first start for close to a month because of injury.Brian Barry-Murphy’s side are 17th in League One, six points above the relegation zone after nine games, yet reached the break on level terms.Of particular interest was how Greenwood would perform in his first game as United’s No 9 – and he impressed. He would have had a first clear chance if Pogba had turned a far-post header to him. Moments later, he was put in along the left by the same player but his control faltered.United seemed to be moving closer to the breakthrough: Greenwood crossed the ball in from the right, yet Pogba’s header was a particularly woeful miss. Possession was largely United’s but they lacked the class and composure to make it count.There was then a real scare for the United defence: it could do nothing as Ollie Rathbone – once of United – found Callum Camps and suddenly Wan-Bissaka had to clear off the line.This had the packed away end delirious and the home support wondering what, precisely, their team was doing. Rochdale could start to believe the upset was on.Greenwood was United’s brightest player, as he continued to pop up in and around Robert Sánchez’s goal.The sign of United’s desperate times came on the hour when Solskjær replaced the toothless Tahith Chong for James, whose impact was instant, laying off a pass to Greenwood whose shot forced Sánchez to concede a corner.Then United had the breakthrough and Brandon Williams, on his debut aged 19, was instrumental. He found Pereira, who relayed the ball to Jesse Lingard: Greenwood took over, and it was 1-0. Yet now came the twist as Matheson raced in from the right and buried a finish past Sergio Romero and penalties beckoned.Rathbone finished disappointed but proud. “It was amazing We were expecting to get drummed here. We did really well,” he said. Solskjær added: “You know we’re better in penalty shootouts than in proper games.” He was joking yet some fans may be worried that such a jest is now true of their team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d26164f7063b743a1c0fcc09bd15e2adbcdb3cf2/0_161_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db30e13f5d3718f08404f98b8ba5578b","title":"mk dons liverpool carabao cup match report","story":"With a sprinkling of gifted youths on a spine of trusty stalwarts, Liverpool cruised past MK Dons and set up a fourth-round showdown with Arsenal. James Milner opened the scoring for the visitors before helping to double Liverpool’s lead by creating a goal for a player nearly half his age, 17-year-old Ki-Jana Hoever.Never had a player as young as Harvey Elliott – age 16 years and 174 days – begun a competitive match for Liverpool’s senior team. Here the prodigy made his first appearance since joining in the summer from Fulham, with whom he made history last season by becoming the youngest player to feature for anyone in this competition. He shone here and could have scored but twice struck shots against the crossbar.Elliott was the most eye-catching of the teenagers in Liverpool’s front three, but 18-year-old Curtis Jones also impressed, while 19-year-old Rhian Brewster made less of an impact even if his movement hinted at the potential that he is known to have. Jürgen Klopp was eager to praise another of the debutants, 20-year-old Caoimhín Kelleher, who made an excellent late save to deny Jordan Bowery.MK Dons, with six changes from the Southend defeat, were determined to be more than supporting cast members in the Liverpool roadshow. They nearly stole the limelight with a nice attack in the 11th minute, which ended with Conor McGrandles whacking a shot just over the bar from 12 yards. Then Liverpool took centre stage. Milner danced forward from left-back to smash a low pass across the face of goal. This looked like being Elliott’s moment to announce himself but he slammed his shot against the bar from six yards.Undeterred, Elliott continued to down the right with skill, enterprise and an artful left foot. With one marvellous piece of play in the 26th minute he invited Milner to score but the veteran sent a plunging header inches wide.Eventually Milner made the breakthrough thanks to a large helping of luck. When a poor clearance fell to him just at the edge of the area, his shot seemed little more than a token gesture until Stuart Moore fumbled it over the line.The hosts tried to fight back but landed no blows, Bowery going closest with a shot off the outside of the post. Hoever soon settled matters for Liverpool with a wonderful goal. Milner created it by hanging up a cross to the back post, where the 17-year-old leapt between George Williams and Joe Walsh to head superbly into the net.Despite a bit of late panic, Liverpool went close to making it 3-0, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hitting the post from long-range before Elliott curled another effort against the bar. So the 16-year-old did not get on the scoresheet but sure made an impression on his boss. “He will always be a special player for moments but his overall performance, including defence, was very good,” said Klopp."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/170d8aac7e132770433b5d43cd984c9e19c24eb2/0_51_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dad909eff661dc44d0f068da524c2a5a","title":"oxford ease past west ham united shock carabao cup victory football","story":"Manuel Pellegrini took full responsibility after West Ham crashed out of the Carabao Cup following this humbling at Oxford. The League One side scored four unanswered goals via Elliott Moore, Matty Taylor, Tariqe Fosu and the excellent Shandon Baptiste to progress into the fourth round for the first time in 22 years.West Ham had made nine changes after the 2-0 win at home to Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday and Pellegrini said: “The whole team didn’t play well.“Not only did we concede four goals, but we didn’t create too many chances. We missed too many passes from the beginning and the responsibility is first on me because I picked the players and second of course on the team that didn’t compete.“The players must understand, but I repeat we couldn’t do it because in front was a team that played very well. I don’t want to take anything away from Oxford because they played very well.”Only Issa Diop and Pablo Fornals retained their starting berths from the win over United, but Pellegrini introduced Felipe Anderson and Sébastien Haller off the bench early in the second half. He defended his team selection here, insisting it was a necessity because of their fixture schedule.He said: “I think in England if you want to play in all the competitions you need to use your whole squad. You cannot just continue with the same players that play on Saturday.”West Ham supporters were making plenty of noise during the opening exchanges, including mocking their London rivals Tottenham, who were dumped out of the competition on penalties at Colchester on Tuesday. But Oxford delivered a brutal shock to send another Premier League side out.Pellegrini’s counterpart, Karl Robinson, was delighted with his players and urged the 9,000 home supporters to turn up again for Saturday’s league fixture with Gillingham. “We had the belief in ourselves that we could get a result,” he said.“I’m over the moon for the fans and the players. It’s about the players, about the fans and about the community of Oxfordshire and the big thing for me now is the people who came here for the first time in a long time, that they buy a ticket and come on Saturday. We want them to support us moving forward because economical growth is important for what we are trying to achieve.”Robinson, who masterminded a 4-0 win against Manchester United five years ago as MK Dons manager, admitted the result was one of Oxford’s best at home in recent years, surpassing their FA Cup wins against Newcastle and Swansea.“Looking at the scoreboard, 4-0 against West Ham and a very strong West Ham, this will probably go down as one of the biggest results at the Kassam in recent years.”Robinson’s side quickly got back into their stride after the substitution and hit the crossbar with when Hall’s free kick almost crept in.West Ham responded with the lively Holland testing Simon Eastwood from a tight angle on the left before Moore cleared the loose ball. Jack Wilshere tried his luck from range in the 32nd minute, yet it was a comfortable for the U’s goalkeeper.Robert Snodgrass was denied a shot on goal by Rob Dickie early in the second period before the hosts’ confidence increased again when Roberto sliced a clearance behind for a corner.West Ham survived that set piece and the next, but Robinson’s team kept the ball alive and Mark Sykes crossed in for Moore, who controlled and fired into the bottom corner from eight yards. shock was firmly on the cards and Sykes was giving Arthur Masuaku plenty of problems and almost created a second for Oxford two minutes later when Mackie flicked goalwards, but Roberto produced a brilliant stop to save the Hammers. It was one-way traffic, with the U’s eager for a second and Pellegrini reacted by introducing Sebastien Haller and Felipe Anderson, but it failed to have the desired effect.Oxford increased their lead with 19 minutes left. Sykes was allowed too much space on the right and he crossed in for Taylor to tap home at the back post. Fosu, fresh from a hat-trick at Lincoln on Saturday, then slipped past Arthur Masuaku, rounded Roberto and slotted home. In added time Baptiste side-footed into the bottom corner to send Oxford into the fourth round, and with it a home tie against Sunderland, for the first time since 1997."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=209c6913855b5d592b99b6f7d55f2989","title":"tell us about the moment you realised your cat loved you","story":"If you have lived with a cat we’d like to hear your stories about when you discovered they returned your affectionCats, it turns out, love humans more than we might think.

It sounds simple, but when you want to impress, the temptation to overcomplicate food can leave you feeling overwhelmed and overworked. So how do you make food to remember, without breaking your back in the kitchen? The answer is to take inspiration from the French – not their haute cuisine, but their countryside cooking, which is just as tasty and a fraction of the effort. The secret is simply to use the best quality ingredients, which should be left to do the culinary talking for you. When the basics are really good, there’s not much more you need to do other than throwing them together.Chicken is a great example. If you buy a standard supermarket chicken, you have to cover it in herbs and spices or even marinate it overnight to get a decent flavour out of it. Get yourself a poulet de bresse, and it’s a whole different story. These birds have been bred in the same French province for centuries, they have loads of space to run around, and they’re encouraged to eat a varied diet. Because of all that, you can put it straight in the oven on a low heat for an hour, then take it out, cover it in salt, and put it back in on high for 15 minutes, and you’ve got a meal for four that tastes out of this world.If you’ve got really nice bull’s heart tomatoes, cucumber and some olive oil, it’s pretty easy to just mix it up into a great salad to go with it crap vegetables make crap salads, and then you need to make it more complicated to make it taste better, which is a false economy. French culinary sensibilities make solo dining low effort too. I remember sitting out one night in Portugal with a tin of Ortiz tuna and crusty bread, and I just spent the whole evening on my balcony eating that with some drinks. It was perfect – no mayonnaise necessary.Speaking of drinks, when it comes to cocktails the same rules apply. If you’ve got good quality Grey Goose Vodka, you don’t need to mask the taste with syrupy mixers. Rather, you should let the inherent quality of Grey Goose Vodka do the talking, using it as the perfect base for botanical and classic citrus flavours such as elderflower, lemon juice or lime juice, as they complement the vodka without overpowering it – both Le Grand Fizz and Paris to Pampelonne are cocktails that add something new to the vodka without distracting from its taste. Grey Goose cocktails are wonderfully versatile too. If you’re pairing with something sweet, an Espresso Martini with high-quality espresso will balance things out nicely.Going straight to suppliers gives your food a story as well, which makes for great dinner party conversation. Customers love it when we wax lyrical about where our produce comes from in my restaurants, and so will your dinner party guests. Around six years ago, I was Instagramming some fishermen in their boat, and they were telling me what fish they’d caught that morning, and the next day it was in my restaurant. People love to hear these sorts of anecdotes because they help them feel connected to the food, which is why “I got it from the supermarket” never quite cuts it when you’re entertaining at home. While you will probably have picked your vodka from the supermarket, with a brand like Grey Goose there’s still a story to tell. Grey Goose is made with only two ingredients: single-origin Picardie winter wheat and water from its natural limestone well – a true reflection of Grey Goose’s French sensibilities.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

It’s only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives who will deliver Brexit by 31 October and end free movement once and for all.”The conference motion read: “Confronted with attacks on migrants – from the racist hostile environment to the Conservatives’ immigration bill that plans to end free movement and strip the rights of working-class migrants – we stand for solidarity, equality and freedom.“Scapegoating, ending free movement and attacking migrants’ rights are attacks on all workers. They make migrant workers more precarious and vulnerable to hyper-exploitation, pressing down wages and conditions for everyone. They ide us, making it harder to unionise and push back.”Ben Towse, an organiser for the Labour Campaign for Free Movement, said the conference had made history by adopting a policy of “radical solidarity with migrants”.He added: “The next Labour government will now make history by immediately closing every detention centre, by granting democratic rights to millions of people, by extending free movement and by taking on xenophobic scapegoating lies with workers’ unity and solidarity, across the artificial isions of birthplace.”Many migrants in the UK have residence on the condition that they have no recourse to public funds, meaning they are not able to claim most benefits, tax credits or housing assistance. The policy renders many destitute and reliant on charities to survive.Celebrating the success of the motion, the Labour Campaign for Free Movement tweeted a photograph of the controversial “Controls on immigration” mugs produced by Labour during the 2015 general election campaign. “Now officially in the bin,” the tweet said.At the 2017 election, Labour’s manifesto said freedom of movement within the EU would end when the UK ceased to be a member. After Brexit, the party wants a close relationship with the single market, but it has not formally committed to keeping the UK in the single market, which would ensure free movement continued."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f669792208e0c10410d9c23bd5975b35ed50fc87/0_118_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f72ece179682249406a9aa3c36e92e62","title":"pm branded a disgrace after saying best way to honour jo cox is to deliver brexit","story":"Boris Johnson’s reference to memory of murdered MP prompts gasps in Commons Boris Johnson has been branded a disgrace for dismissing pleas from Labour MPs to stop using inflammatory language in light of the murder of Jo Cox, telling one that it was “humbug” and another that the best way to honour her was to “get Brexit done”.Johnson caused uproar in the House of Commons after he responded dismissively to Labour MP Paula Sherriff, who made a heartfelt speech calling on him to stop using language such as “surrender”, “traitor” and “betrayal” in relation to Brexit.He also drew gasps when telling Labour’s Tracy Brabin, who was elected to Cox’s seat following the MP’s murder by a far-right extremist a week before the EU referendum, that “the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to bring this country together is, I think, to get Brexit done”.Before her death, Cox had campaigned to remain in the EU. Her widower, Brendan Cox, swiftly condemned the prime minister’s remarks, saying it had left him feeling sick.Johnson’s attitude was lambasted by Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, who called him a “disgrace” and Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP first minister, who said she felt “disgust watching Johnson”, describing him as “untrustworthy, craven, not a shred of concern for the consequences of his words or actions”. Dawn Butler, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, said his reaction showed that Johnson was “a cruel, uncaring, spoilt man”.Swinson revealed on Wednesday that she had reported to police a death threat against her young child.Amber Rudd, who resigned from Johnson’s cabinet earlier this month, told ITV the prime minister was being “dishonest and dangerous” in his use of language.Jess Phillips, the Labour MP and women’s rights campaigner, highlighted an anonymous death threat she had personally received, quoting Johnson’s image that he would rather be dead in a ditch than fail to deliver Brexit. “That is what will happen to those who fail to deliver Brexit,” it said.“10 Downing Street might think we are ‘humbugs’ about his words but they are literally being used in death threats against me,” she said.“I get death threats and still I stand up. I don’t surrender to fear and aggression. I don’t surrender to lowest common denominator of fear to votes. I don’t surrender to bullies who call me names. It is not I who have surrendered, it is Boris Johnson. He has surrendered his dignity.”John Bercow, the Speaker, implicitly rebuked Johnson and told MPs that he had also received threats: “Each and every one of us has a responsibility to weigh his or her words ... with care, eloquence, humour but in terms that demonstrate respect for those who hold a point of view that differs from our own.”Jeremy Corbyn called on the Speaker to call together the leaders of all parties to issue a joint declaration “opposing any form of abusive language or threats and to put this message out to our entire community that we have to treat each other with respect”.“If we don’t, then what happens is those on our streets who would do violence feel emboldened to do it and the most vulnerable people in our society suffer as a result of it,” the Labour leader added.Bercow said he was “very open” to the idea of convening a meeting to draw up a house-wide public statement.After an aggressive debate in parliament, with the prime minister accusing the opposition of signing a “surrender act” over Brexit, Sherriff received applause from the opposition benches for calling on Johnson to stop using such language.“We should not resort to using offensive, dangerous or inflammatory language for legislation that we do not like and we stand here under the shield of our departed friend with many of us in this place subject to death threats and abuse every single day,” she said.“And let me tell the prime minister that they often quote his words ‘surrender act’, ‘betrayal’, ‘traitor’ and I for one am sick of it. We must moderate our language and it has to come from the prime minister first. He should be absolutely ashamed of himself.”Johnson replied with a half-smile, saying: “I have to say Mr Speaker I’ve never heard such humbug in all my life.”He was also confronted by Brabin, who criticised him for using language such as “surrender”, arguing it cast his opponents as traitors.“As the woman who has taken over a seat left by our dear friend Jo Cox, can I ask him in all honesty as a human being please, please will he going forward moderate his language so that we will all feel secure when we’re going about our jobs?” she said.However, Johnson responded by repeating some of the language and suggesting the answer was to deliver Brexit.“Of course there will be an attempt to try to obfuscate the effect of this Act, but it does – the capitulation act, or the surrender act or whatever you want to call it – it does, I’m sorry, but it greatly enfeebles, it greatly enfeebles this government’s ability to negotiate.“But what I will say is that the best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.”Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, condemned the abuse that MPs had received as “deeply, deeply unpleasant and troubling”.He said: “We all have a responsibility to be mild in our language when we’re speaking in this house or outside.“I’m afraid to say it’s something where all sides err from time to time and it would be invidious to pick on inidual examples but we have a responsibility of leadership.”Former Tory Anna Soubry raised a point of order to criticise the prime minister’s language: “It takes a lot to reduce this honourable member to tears ... but I am not alone tonight. There are others who have left the estate such has been the distress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b858235a242932e60c4f97a9d0e9f0f4dbc89d35/550_1136_4693_2816/master/4693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd37fda1ac9629420d15a993b876c1c","title":"can labour unite and plot a path to power","story":"Sonia Sodha joins Anushka Asthana to discuss Labour’s options now that parliament has resumed and the party has backed Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit strategy.

They have teat-shaped spouts, appear designed to be easily held by an older baby or toddler and one is shaped as an imaginary animal, suggesting it may have doubled as a toy. Julie Dunne, a chemist at the University of Bristol and lead author, said: “These very small, evocative, vessels give us valuable information on how and what babies were fed thousands of years ago, providing a real connection to mothers and infants in the past.”The finding suggests that a shift towards weaning babies earlier could have played a crucial role in a population boom that occurred in the Neolithic period, around the same time that some humans moved away from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle towards one that depended on crops and animals. “It could help explain why Neolithic women can suddenly have many more babies,” said Dunne. “There’s so much more to it than the baby bottle.”Small feeding vessels, made from clay, first appear in Europe in the Neolithic (at around 5,000 BC), and become more commonplace during the bronze and iron ages that follow. However, it has not been clear whether the pots were specifically made for babies – it has also been suggested they were used to feed the sick or elderly.The latest findings provide a vital link, showing that three vessels found in child burial sites were filled with animal milk. A chemical analysis of lipids that survived in the bottom of the pot suggests that the milk would have come from a cow, goat or sheep.The children that the bottles were found alongside had ages of between one to two years, around two and under six years.Katharina Rebay-Salisbury, a co-author from the Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, said: “Bringing up babies in prehistory was not an easy task. We are interested in researching cultural practices of mothering, which had profound implications for the survival of babies.”She said that the development of bottles could have made mothering a more “collective” responsibility, at a time when people were starting to live in larger groups, with some settlements of several hundred people. Stopping breastfeeding infants at an earlier age could also have led to shorter gaps between siblings.Rebay-Salisbury, who is leading a major project on motherhood in prehistory, said that there is a growing realisation that studying how children lived in the past could provide crucial insights into ancient societies. “For a long time, people were just interested in swords and men,” she said. “Gradually we’re discovering that there were other people as well who deserve our attention, including children and mothers.”The team is planning to analyse other, similar artefacts. “Similar vessels, although rare, do appear in other prehistoric cultures, such as Rome and ancient Greece, across the world,” said Dunne. “Ideally, we’d like to carry out a larger geographic study and investigate whether they served the same purpose.”The analysis is published in the journal Nature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a2ba65ae420982be156a676607e3a4491001d2/249_187_1605_963/master/1605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd07ee16b322606b9beca1aad060e8cb","title":"scientists invent new technology to print invisible messages","story":"Messages can only be seen under UV light and can be erased using a hairdryerForget lemon juice and hot irons, there is a new way to write and read invisible messages – and it can be used again and again.The approach, developed by researchers in China, involves using water to print messages on paper coated with manganese-containing chemicals. The message, invisible to the naked eye, can be read by shining UV light on the paper.With the use of hot air from a hairdryer, the message can be erased and the paper reused.Despite digital communications and data security becoming more sophisticated, the study’s authors said finding ways to securely send hard copy messages remained important.“Data leakage has become a global problem with terrible consequences including outbreaks of war and severe economic and social issues,” they say in the study.“Although electronic media have become indispensable in our daily lives, paper is still the most widespread medium for information storage, and many important documents are still paper based.”Writing in the journal Matter, the team say other approaches to “secure printing” include the use of fluorescent inks that can only be seen under UV light. However, they say these have drawbacks, including that they cannot be erased and the paper reused, and are predictable – meaning the messages, once found, can be easily cracked.The team report that they have developed a number of solutions to tackle each of these problems. The new approach involves coating filter paper with a polymer that has manganese-containing chemicals, which can absorb UV light and emit green light, and then printing messages on this paper with pure water using an inkjet printer. The team said the materials have very low toxicity.When the pure water interacts with the manganese-containing chemicals, it disrupts their structure, hence their photoluminescent properties. The upshot is that while the message cannot be seen with the naked eye, it shows up as a dark drawing under short wavelength UV light.If the paper is heated under a hairdryer for about 30 seconds, the message disappears. So far, the researchers have managed to reuse the paper up to 30 times before it breaks down – with each print costing fractions of a penny.“If we can find a good substrate to replace filter paper, we believe the cycle numbers will be further improved,” said Dr Yun Ma, the co-author of the study, from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.The authors said the message did not simply disappear with evaporation of water in the absence of a hairdryer, and it can last for more than three months under ambient conditions.One possible explanation, they say, is that it might be necessary to melt the polymer coating to allow the necessary movement for the structure (and hence photoluminescence) of the manganese-containing chemicals to be restored after the water has evaporated. The team also took a different approach, using two manganese-containing inks to print a message and background on a different type of coated filter paper.The message cannot be seen by the naked eye or, importantly, under UV light since the similarity in the inks mean both it and the background emit light of a very similar wavelength and intensity under UV illumination. However, the message emits light over a longer period of time than the background, meaning it can be read using time-based imaging techniques.Developing this further, the team came up with an even more sophisticated approach that involves printing a series of numbers on paper using several manganese-containing inks, each of which emits light over a different period of time after UV illumination.By tracking the intensity of light emission over time, a new order of the numbers is revealed – allowing the code to be cracked. The paper can then be washed in a special solution and the same string of numbers reprinted with a different order of the inks to encode a different message.“This information decryption method possess an extremely high security level and might be promising in military and economic domains,” the team said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2195fff7877319f166b98f2e55d4258e041fd0df/89_34_1983_1190/master/1983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d53eec76e96074b46e1eb50e6f332a07","title":"dina asher smith history three medals world athletics championships","story":"No British athlete has left a world championships with three medals clanking from their neck. But Dina Asher-Smith’s form is so ominous that the bookies give her a better than 5050 shot of writing a new chapter in track and field history. They are running scared. Her opponents could be forgiven for feeling the same way.After all, Asher-Smith is this year’s Diamond League winner over 100m, the clear favourite for gold over 200m, and the vital cog in Britain’s 4x100m women’s relay team who won silver in London two years ago. For most people in the sport it is not a question of whether she will win a medal in Doha, but how many and of which colour.That is an enormous weight for Asher-Smith to bear on her 23-year-old shoulders, especially given that – Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Laura Muir apart – the British team do not possess a deep well of inidual medal talent at these championships.Asher-Smith insists that she has been planning to go global since 2017 – and is now ready to deliver. “My coach John Blackie has been putting me through my paces for a very long time to prepare for this,” she said.“When we came off London 2017 and went into training for 2018, that was when we made the decision that I was going to double up and that is the time period you need to build up the strength to be able to put together six elite standard sprint races in a championships. We have been preparing for a very, very long time. It has been painful. John has been testing me. When he tells me: ‘You are doing this today,” I am like: ‘What?’“But we have been preparing and that is why the decision to double up isn’t one that I have taken lightly, it’s not a flippant decision.”The European championships last year in Berlin proved the perfect dress rehearsal as Asher-Smith beat her British records in running 10.85sec to win the 100m and 21.89 to take the 200m before winning her third gold in leading the relay team to victory with a stunning anchor leg. This time she knows it will be tougher, especially in the 100m where she faces the formidable Jamaican Olympic champions Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Elaine Thompson, who have both run 10.73 this season. The word from the Jamaican camp is that both are in fantastic shape for Doha, which could put gold out of reach for Asher-Smith in that event.However in the 200m she is clearly the women to beat, especially with the Bahaman Shaunae Miller-Uibo, who has not lost a race since 2017, deciding to only run the 400m because of scheduling issues.While Asher-Smith knows a podium place in the 100m or 200m would make her the first British woman since Kathy Smallwood-Cook in 1983 to win a global sprint medal, she insists she is not feeling the pressure. “Weirdly enough I don’t and I think that is because I tune out of social media. We have been very clear, John and I, about what my aims are for this season. And we don’t really publicly disclose that until afterwards and that is done deliberately to control expectation.“There definitely is a little bit of expectation but it is something that is nice and something that is refreshing as a British female sprinter – we expect you to do X, Y and Z.”However as she prepares for her first race, in the 100m heats on Saturday, Asher-Smith knows she is facing a moment of truth. “The world championships is going to be the first time where we see everybody with nowhere to hide this year. There’s no ‘I wasn’t ready for this, I wasn’t ready for this’, because if you are not ready for the world championships, when are you ready?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/776c79fb627c5002720c10fba13f3247d4aa0ddd/0_299_5134_3080/master/5134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0783ca853d7ed85c1f789b59e19e7fb","title":"england usa rugby world cup","story":"Having sapped a few spirits in Sapporo last Sunday England’s next objective is to put the “ko” into Kobe, Japan’s most enthusiastic rugby city. Waiting until their key pool games against Argentina and France to underline their genuine World Cup pedigree is theoretically fine but, as Wales showed against Georgia, it is never too early to catch and pass with precision and give their future opponents something to ponder.A four-day turnaround including a hasty flight south, on the other hand, have allowed precious little time for reflection on the Tonga game and England’s plan for the USA Eagles was preordained a while ago. The objective is simple: get the job done as simply and effectively as possible before moving on to the crunchier fixtures in Tokyo which will determine the final pecking order in Pool C. While they pride themselves on their world-class beef hereabouts, Eddie Jones’s side do not want to make a meal of this particular contest.It could well prove more awkward than some are envisaging. In past tournaments it has generally been the lower-ranked nations who have been required to back up within 96 hours of a bruising Test. This time it is the Eagles who have been enjoying the luxury of uninterrupted preparation on the island of Okinawa while England have been playing and shaking out their suitcases. A similar schedule clearly did not help Fiji against Uruguay, mentally or physically. When Gary Gold, the USA head coach, talked up Jones’s squad as having no apparent weaknesses he slyly omitted to mention he and his Eagles have been targeting this game for months.Much work has gone in to improving their set-piece and they will be equally keen to test England physically and via their tactical kicking.Get ahead and there are few more committed sides in terms of putting bodies on the line. England’s challenge – which partly explains the starting XV Jones has named – will involve making the most of any ball kicked their way, utilising their pace out wide and retaining possession rather better than they did against the Tongans. “The one area we really want to impress with is our attack and keeping hold of the ball,” said Joe Launchbury, one of 13 players in the matchday 23 not involved in Sapporo. Over their midweek team lunch largely consisting of the aforementioned Kobe beef, however, it might have been worth someone raising the subject of the 2007 version of this fixture in Lens when England made desperately heavy weather of beating a spirited American side and lost their then‑captain, Phil Vickery, for their big pool game against South Africa after he was banned for a trip on the Eagles centre Paul Emerick.For Jones to lose a key player or two to a similarly out-of-the-blue incident or injury would be untimely to say the least. Nor does he want to see those currently not perceived as first-choice starters trying to throw miracle passes or veering “off script” in a bid to further their inidual chances of selection against the Pumas. The USA may be ranked 13th in the world, below Georgia, but they could pose their opponents more scoreboard problems than Tonga, ranked 15th, ultimately did in Sunday’s 35-3 contest.Gold also knows this stadium well, having coached the local Kobelco Steelers. Kobe is home to a huge port and is Japan’s leading sake-producing region, a combination which may help to explain why its residents love their rugby so much. For seven years in a row between 1989 and 1995 their team won the Top 14 title, inspired by Japan’s so-called “Mr Rugby”, Seiji Hirao, who attended Oxford University, played in three World Cup tournaments and also coached the national side.Hirao died of cancer aged 53 in 2016 but his legacy lives on in Kobe. “It has always been a place where rugby is the predominant sport, which is not the case in most cities in Japan,” said Jones. “There are bars around the town which are dedicated to rugby which is unusual here. Most of the fans are rugby fans, not football fans or baseball fans, so it stands out in that way.”Rugby, furthermore, played its part in rebuilding morale following the 1995 Kobe earthquake which killed almost 6,500 people but Jones’s most abiding sporting memory was a match his Japan side played here in the autumn of 2014. “We had two games against the Maori All Blacks and when we played them here we were beaten by 60 points. We didn’t deliberately go out to get beaten but we deliberately played away from our strengths to send a message to the team about how we were going to play. The next game we played, we got beaten by one point. It reinforced the point we had to play to our strengths.”Jones, apparently, has since attempted something similar as England’s coach, with similar results. “How did it go? Not well. It doesn’t usually go well when you don’t play to your strengths, but it can be a great education for the team.” Soon enough, though, the time for experimentation and tinkering will be over. With Jack Nowell and Henry Slade seemingly on the mend, competition for places is about to intensify further from next week onwards. This is not the moment for England’s midweekers to take their eyes off the ball."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4df9c62eed2868176815582ea79ead6838964c3/0_370_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=245058ac5e1d8428f3e088725a315f03","title":"jane couch britains first licenced female boxer interview","story":"“I just think I’m damaged, like really damaged,” Jane Couch says quietly as the tears roll down her face. She hunches over and her body shakes. This is the painful cost of being the pioneer of women’s boxing in Britain. Couch was the five-time world champion boxer who was barred from fighting in her own country. Just over 20 years ago the British Boxing Board of Control still insisted women were too emotionally unstable to box.On my way to meet Couch I hear that Katie Taylor, the brilliant Irish boxer, will headline a bill at the Manchester Arena on 2 November with Anthony Crolla, a former world champion and much-loved Mancunian, on her undercard. Without Couch’s courage and defiance, Taylor would not be in this position.Couch had to win a court case against the sport’s governing body to make British sporting history in August 1998. Bernard Buckley, the board’s solicitor, built his case on the claim that “many women suffer from premenstrual tension which makes them more emotional and more labile and accident-prone. They are too fragile to box and they bruise easily.”But Couch had shown her mettle to win her first world title in only her fifth fight in 1996. She had flown to Denmark to face Sandra Geiger, the French world champion who came from a kickboxing background. Couch suffered a broken jaw, shattered cheekbone, fractured eye-socket, cracked ribs and a missing tooth but she still won a unanimous decision over 10 rounds. She and Geiger both ended up in hospital.Her world titles and landmark legal victory were of little benefit to Couch. She still struggled to get fights and there were many times when she travelled abroad and, after brutal bouts, was not even paid. At home Couch was shunned by boxing promoters and mocked on television and in the tabloids.I have known Couch since the late 1990s, when I first interviewed her, and she is one of the most admirable and kindest people I’ve met in boxing. She retired 10 years ago but today, as she relives the past trauma, her usual laughter is replaced by grief. When we take a break, because it is so upsetting for her, Couch says simply: “I wish I hadn’t been the first. I wish I hadn’t gone through all that shit.”The 51-year-old Couch looks up when I say her scars seem more like wounds. “I’m damaged,” she says again. “I didn’t think I was but the counsellors and doctors encourage you to talk. They say: ‘It’s good to get it out. If you hold it in, Jane, you’ll only do more damage.’”She wipes her eyes and apologises for crying. Yet her tears are a sign of strength. They show her candour and fight. “I hope so. I just find it hard. It hurts my pride to talk this openly but I don’t think people realise the damage they did. Most of them had never met me and they’d call me a lesbian or a freak.”“Dinah messed them up because they thought she was going only on sex discrimination. She used that but focused on restraint of trade. I was already a double world champion and the board was stopping me making a living in this country. We won but, when I got the licence, I thought: ‘It will be all right now.’ The abuse got worse. Dinah knew it would happen. We left the press conference after the court case. She put her arms around me and goes: ‘I don’t want to tell you this, but your fight’s just beginning.’”Couch’s eyes are clear again. “I know what she means now. I’d be on TV shows like Richard and Judy and they would have phone-ins for people to vote. ‘Is she a freak? Should she be allowed to box?’ When people keep calling you a freak you think, ‘Maybe I am?’ Three years before I retired I would just sit on my own, crying. I couldn’t see a way out.”A year after she retired, in 2008, Couch had a breakdown. “I was very down. I didn’t want to go out. I was having panic attacks. Other women fighters were sending me messages about their problems. I had pains in my chest like I was having a heart attack.”A friend took Couch to hospital and “this amazing lady doctor told me I was having a panic attack. I was like: ‘How can I have a panic attack? I’m not scared of anything.’ I told her what I did and she said: ‘You’ve got to bury boxing otherwise this will always haunt you.’”Writing her book, and talking about it, has been distressing but Couch knows this is the road to lasting peace. “I wasn’t a skilful boxer. I fought with my heart. I learned that in the gym because I had to be tough – sparring with boys. Those first days in the gym were bad. They’d say: ‘Fuck off, you’re a girl.’ They laughed at me. They’re all skipping brilliant and I’m tripping over the rope. I could hear them laughing but I was thinking: ‘I’ll show you.’”She laughs at her youthful audacity. Before her first world title fight against Geiger she trained for nine months and sparred against well-known male professionals such as Glenn Catley and Dean Francis. “Glenn was a serious puncher but he was good with me. They were all good with me but they still hit me. They’d be no good to me if they didn’t. They taught me to fight back when you’re hurt.”Not one line about her becoming world champion was written in the national press or mentioned on radio or television. “I thought I was going to get mobbed at the airport but no one was there. I got Boxing News that next Friday. I was all excited but there was nothing. My manager shrugged. ‘They don’t do women’s boxing.’ He was as bad as them. A week later he said: ‘You’ve got a defence in New Orleans.’ I didn’t even want to go back to the gym but I convinced myself.”Couch cleared £200, after expenses were deducted, for winning the world title. But the New Orleans promoter said he had no money to pay her after she won another hard fight. At least she ended up having Angelo Dundee, Muhammad Ali’s trainer, and the great former world champion Matthew Saad Muhammad helping in her corner. Couch also talks about the kindness of Marvin Hagler and Lennox Lewis, and her friendships with Frank Bruno and Ricky Hatton. But her love of boxing has soured.“I wasn’t right a few years before I retired. I went on too long. We did the brain scan. They said: ‘Oh, you’ve had a slight alteration.’ I knew that meant brain damage. They said: ‘If you carry on taking blows it will get progressively worse.’ That’s why I retired.”Does she feel any side-effects now? “Yeah. The memory’s a bit bad. But that’s most fighters, isn’t it? Physically I’m not too bad but I became institutionalised, I think, to the other damage.”Many former fighters suffer from depression and Couch believes “boxing is definitely a factor. So many of my old sparring partners are in prison or on drugs or alcoholics. There’s got to be some connection with boxing when you look at all the lads in jail or on drugs.”Couch’s toughest fight was against Lucia Rijker in Los Angeles in 2003. Rijker is arguably the greatest female boxer in history and Couch survived 10 rounds despite having an eardrum perforated. “I thought I was brain-damaged because there was a roaring in my head and my balance was totally gone. I was swallowing blood and it made a cracking sound. I thought: ‘Seven rounds to go. The damage is done. I might as well carry on.’”After all the pain she suffered for such little reward does she feel any envy when hearing about Taylor’s headlining show? “Not a bit because I’ve buried it all now. What Katie’s done for boxing and women in Ireland is massive. I know because my fella’s Irish. She’s a superstar and that’s how it should be. It just wasn’t like that for me – or most women boxers today. I had a girl telling me her fight’s been cancelled because she didn’t sell enough tickets. That’s more typical of women’s boxing. It’s even been tough for Nicola Adams.”When she won gold at the London Olympics in 2012, Adams made a point of acknowledging her success would not have been possible without Couch carving out a path before her. British boxing’s great female pioneer is still fighting to win her own battle to overcome everything that boxing did to her. Does she feel as if she is winning?“I’m getting there,” she says with a little smile. “I’ve been with my partner Brian for nine years. We’re so happy. It’s helping me find a way out of boxing. It’s hard – but I’m happy when I’m not talking about boxing.”Jane Couch’s The Final Round is published by Pitch"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb7e5dbdce936be222626a5cd46d414c7f5e204/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fd3770e75e2d76dcdffae409d694e1a","title":"canadas green party alters photo of leader elizabeth may using single use cup","story":"Image of Elizabeth May manipulated to make it seem as if she was using a reusable cup and metal straw instead of a disposable cupCanada’s Green party has admitted to manipulating a photograph on its website to make it seem as if the party leader was using a reusable plastic cup and metal straw instead of a disposable paper cup.The image shows Elizabeth May, smiling and holding a plastic cup emblazoned with the Green party logo and with a metal straw inserted in its cover.But the same photo had previously appeared on news websites and showed that May was holding a paper cup with no straw, the National Post reported.Confronted with the clear discrepancy, May told reporters she was “completely shocked” that staff had edited the image without her approval.“And I’m sorry for the staff person that did it.

I have no idea.”May denied that the manipulated image was meant to bolster her environment credentials, arguing that paper cups are compostable.“It won’t surprise you to know I never take a plastic drinking water bottle, I carry my own mug, I carry my own utensils on airplanes so I never take a single-use plastic item,” May told reporters. “So it’s bizarre that the notion of fakery should stretch to someone who doesn’t fake anything.”In recent months, plastics have become an environmental touchstone in Canadian politics, after the Liberal government pledged in June to ban single-use plastics, including disposable plates and utensils, by as early as 2021. Shortly afterwards, however, Justin Trudeau was photographed in a meeting with single-use items scattered on the table, and as a result, some politicians have become wary of images that could potentially undercut their environmental credentials.May did, however, have advice for her team in the event they chose to manipulate another image: “If they’re going to Photoshop, couldn’t they do something with my face and make it look a little younger?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa718f964aa6515b236c9290337c244264a2022/0_9_1141_685/master/1141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0db0f773148f805c3de1baec8b15f6c","title":"israels president chooses netanyahu to form government","story":"Reuven Rivlin frustrated after talks between ruling party and opposition stallIsrael’s president has tasked Benjamin Netanyahu with forming a coalition government, throwing a lifeline to the incumbent prime minister after an inconclusive election threatened to end his political career.Reuven Rivlin’s offer does not guarantee Netanyahu will lead Israel’s next administration. Before that can happen, Netanyahu has up to six weeks to forge a majority coalition in Israel’s parliament.“The responsibility for forming the government will be handed to prime minister and Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu,” the president’s office said in a statement.With a ided Knesset, the 69-year-old leader now faces an uphill battle to secure support from at least 61 of 120 lawmakers. If his attempts fail, Rivlin could assign the task to someone else, most likely Benny Gantz, the leader of the opposition.That scenario almost played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance.Many fear a third election will be called if the stalemate holds.The president had been pushing the two main parties to put aside their differences and form a unity government as together they would have more than enough seats for a majority. Talks appeared to have stalled.Domestic media speculated the Rivlin may have picked Netanyahu as a way of pushing the two to reach an agreement. The president could have waited up to a week to decide but his announcement adds pressure on Netanyahu to make political deals on a deadline or risk losing grip on power.The prime minister has several potential routes to form a government, but many would require lawmakers from rival parties to defect. The clearest path would be to get support from Avigdor Lieberman, whose eight seats afford him a kingmaker status. However, Lieberman, a secular ultranationalist, has refused to sit in a government with religious parties, whose support Netanyahu also depends on.Netayahu’s freedom is also potentially on the line. Next week, pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him are set to begin. If he retains the role of prime minister, he will not be required to step down, even if indicted. Netanyahu has denied all allegations.The central election committee released an official vote tally on Wednesday from last week’s poll that confirmed an inconclusive, razor-thin margin between the two main parties, the ruling Likud and Blue and White.Blue and White was one seat ahead, but neither party had enough support from lawmakers to form a majority coalition. Netanyahu, however, came out narrowly ahead of Gantz when Rivlin asked this week for all parliamentarians to endorse a candidate.There is a precedent in Israel for political rivals to serve together after Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres rotated the role of prime minister in the mid-1980s, each agreeing to serve two years.Yet there was little optimism Gantz and Netanyahu could forge a unity government, as both men have demanded the top seat. Gantz, whose election campaign focused on toppling Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, has also repeatedly pledged not to ally with Netanyahu while he faces potential indictments.Further complicating talks, Netanyahu also struck an agreement with rightwing and religious parties that back him to make sure they are part of any future government, something Gantz has sought to avoid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd359dae5cf733a7bb613c348375516b71e27ecc/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=343bf8ca934079128fa093f76702dddd","title":"merkel promises revitalise german forests beetle plagues","story":"Storms, drought, beetles and fires have destroyed equivalent of 250,000 football fieldsAngela Merkel’s government has promised more than half a billion euros to revitalise the country’s crisis-hit forests in the fight against climate change.A third of Germany’s landmass is covered in woodland, and forests play an important role in the country’s national folklore, from the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm to the poems of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.But a combination of storms, drought, forest fires and aggressively spreading bark beetle plagues have so far this year destroyed swathes of German forest equivalent to more than 250,000 football fields, forcing the government to convene an emergency “forest summit”, held on Wednesday in Berlin.“Every missing tree is a missing comrade-in-arms against climate change,” agriculture minister Julia Klöckner said ahead of the gathering of around 170 organisations representing both environmental groups and industry. “Whatever we don’t reforest today, our grandchildren will, of course, miss.”In the face of the numerous challenges, Germany’s federal government has announced making available €547mover the next four years to remove dead trees and plant new ones, with state contributions boosting the emergency fund to €800m. The defence minister and CDU leader, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has pledged the military’s help with the effort.Woodland owners however insist their trees deserve better financial compensation for cleaning polluted air.Representatives of the country’s influential forestry industry – employing some 720,000 people, almost as many as the car sector – have already warned the funds won’t be enough to replace the forest that has been lost.Umbrella organisation AGDW, representing forest owners and forestry workers, has called for direct investments of €2.3bn, as well as a new tax on industrial pollution that would help to subsidise forests at €125 a year per hectare of forest.“Those who pollute our environment with dirt have to pay for it, and those who receive the dirt should be financially compensated in turn”, forest owner Ferdinand Graf von Westerholt told broadcaster ZDF. “That’s the solution.”But even how the funds already made available can be used has become a isive issue between landowner and environmentalists. The forestry industry proposes replanting areas of destroyed forest with some non-native species that are more suited to a drier and hotter climate, such as the Japanese larch, the North American Douglas fir or the northern red oak.Environmental groups warn this could have a devastating impact on local wildlife, which could struggle to adapt to the new environment.Hubert Weiger, chair of the German branch of Friends of the Earth said cash should be injected on “public money for public services” principle: “Taxpayers’ money should only be spent to build up natural broad-leaved deciduous forests made up of native species”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a40c3299fe0eccef7ed2d9acc20301e14f333c/0_126_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cfc629b260b116ae6b89fbf19a85f2c","title":"spanish elections popular leftwing politician forms new party inigo errejon","story":"Podemos co-founder Íñigo Errejón says he hopes to attract disillusioned leftwing votersOne of the Spanish left’s most popular politicians has announced the creation of a splinter party that will run in the 10 November parliamentary elections, adding further uncertainty to the country’s fourth national ballot in four years.Spain has not had a stable government for years, with mainstream parties and newcomers that have appeared over the past five years struggling to strike deals.The Socialist leader, Pedro Sánchez, won a snap election in April but without enough seats for his party to govern on its own, and he ended up calling an election for November after failing to reach a deal with the leftwing Unidas Podemos.Íñigo Errejón, a co-founder of Podemos, which he left in January after disagreements with its leader, Pablo Iglesias, said he was launching the party, Más País (More Country), because he wanted to help form a government and encourage disillusioned leftwing voters to turn up at the polling stations.“I understand the widespread anger of the Spanish people with the current leaders and with the political stalemate,” he said in front of a crowd cheering “president”.Errejón’s party could further fragment the vote and either help the right get a majority or make it harder for any bloc to do so. There was already no guarantee the new election would make it any easier to strike a deal to form a government, and there will now be three main parties on the left and the right, after the far-right Vox made a breakthrough in the April election.“This makes it even more difficult to foresee how the new parliament will look, and what type of feasible majorities will emerge,” said José Fernández-Albertos, a political scientist at Spanish National Research Council.Errejón, 35, who is considered more moderate than Iglesias and was his second in command in Podemos, had in 2016 backed an agreement with the Socialists that Iglesias eventually rejected. In a recent interview, Errejón said he was in favour of a government deal with Sánchez.In his first speech as a candidate, Errejón said he wanted to achieve an agreement among leftwing forces to form a government.Sánchez is currently ahead in opinion polls, but Errejón and Iglesias are on bad terms, making a three-way government deal potentially difficult.Based on how a previous, regional party he set up earlier this year did in local elections in May, Errejón could hope to get as many as five seats in the national parliament in the Madrid region alone.Some analysts said the new party could convince leftwing voters put off by the lack of a deal between the Socialists and Podemos to turn up at polling stations.“The leftwing electorate is going to be motivated. Some to defend Iglesias, others to punish him,” Fernández-Albertos said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4030408.1569440395!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"almost 70 of cyclists without helmet at time of head trauma","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCycling accounted for all four of the sports and exercise-related deaths recorded at the centre over the period. File photograph: GettyAlmost 70 per cent of cyclists transferred to the State’s main centre for treating brain damage were not wearing helmets at the time they sustained their injury, new research shows.Eighteen of the 26 cyclists sent for treatment to the national neurosurgical centre at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin were not wearing helmets, two were and the status of six patients was unknown, a study of admissions to the centre over a 30-month period shows.Cycling accounted for all four of the sports and exercise-related deaths recorded at the centre over the period. Two of these patients were not wearing helmets, one was and the status of the other mortality was unknown.Two of the dead cyclists are recorded as having fallen off their bicycle, while the other two were knocked off.More than half of all sports and exercise-related referrals to the centre between 2016 and 2018 related to cycling injuries, the figures show. The findings are contained in a paper delivered to European Association of Neurosurgical Societies conference on neurosurgery, taking place in Dublin this week. Cycling accounted for 86 cases referred to the centre for a review, Gaelic football for 30 and horse riding for 23. While only 13 rugby injuries were referred, it accounted for the highest rate of patient transfer, almost half, and five of these six patients required major brain surgery for their injuries.Of the remaining referrals, eight related to hurling, while others involved injuries sustained in soccer, golf, mixed martial arts, tennis and trampolining.‘Risk of skull fracture’“The figures show no sport is immune to head injury, so common sense needs to prevail,” said lead author Dr Phil O’Halloran of Beaumont Hospital. As for the issue of helmet-wearing while cycling, he said “you can’t ignore the numbers. Wearing a helmet won’t stop all serious head injury but it does reduce the risk of skull fracture.”A total of 56 patients, including 30 children, were transferred to the acute neurological unit. Almost 70 per cent were ultimately discharged home. Aside from the four deaths, four patients were transferred out with high-dependency care needs. One of these cases was rugby related, while the other others occurred after a fall from a bicycle and a horse and while hiking.The study was prompted by growing concern over the long-term effect of repeated head injuries on brain function. “The continuing efforts by physicians, therapists, administrators and researchers go a long way to reducing the risk of fatal head injury and are a key factor in ensuring the continued popularity of all contact sports,” said Dr O’Halloran."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Research based on cyclists transferred to State\u0026rsquos main centre for treating brain injuryDelivery of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy bridge over Barrow delayed \u0026lsquoby several weeks\u0026rsquoKim Martin\u0026rsquos fiancee, who he was to marry in August, appeals for help to get him homeResearch Lives: Prof Yvonne Buckley, professor of zoology at Trinity College DublinVictim strangled or otherwise made unable to breath in a quarter of cases, study showsMigrant workers provide up to 12pc of global GDP, Michael D Higgins points outStudents who turn 18 while in asylum process should not face \u0026lsquoblunt categorisation\u0026rsquoSkeletal remains could link neolithic builders and Irish people alive todayWhat you need to bear in mind to make sure you end up in the best possible working environmentWhat graduates should keep in mind to ensure they end up in the right job\u0026lsquoAll the stuff we\u0026rsquove gone through for the truth.

While remediation work did not stop main construction work from progressing, the spokesman said that fixing the issue had led to a delay of “weeks, not months”.The council argued that “non-conformances of this nature are not untypical on a structure of this complexity”.Joint ventureThe project is a public-private partnership (PPP) with a joint venture of BAM Civil Construction and Spanish builder Dragados responsible for construction. A spokesman for BAM said the company was contractually precluded from discussing the project.The bridge was initially scheduled to open early this year, but construction complexities unrelated to the issue around the piers have led to delays. It is thought the bridge is now likely to open towards the end of this year or early next year.Challenging weather conditions during the winter may present another hurdle to completion of the project, Wexford County Council said in a statement.“Wexford County Council remains hopeful that the project will open before the end of the year, but also recognises that the timeline is challenging and is subject to an ongoing review. We are conscious that there is a growing anticipation of the opening and that a lot of people in the New Ross area and beyond have waited a long time to see this project come to fruition.”The bridge, which is one of the longest of its construction type in the world, is named after the mother of former US president John F Kennedy, whose ancestors came from the New Ross area.“The project stakeholders are working to ensure that the project is completed safely and opened at the earliest opportunity to realise the benefits that the project will brign to New Ross and the wider region,” the spokesman added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4030476.1569447618!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord brexit like being eight and a half months pregnant for three years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBy sticking to her script and keeping her replies low key  Heather Humphreys easily reached her objective of escaping unscathed. File photograph: Alan BetsonThese days we stand like spellbound urchins outside a sweetshop, eyes wide and noses pressed against the glass, gazing in growing astonishment as incredible scenes play out in the sugar-laden aisles within. Compared with the riveting chaos in the House of Commons, it is so, so dull in Leinster House. Brexit has completely sucked the energy from the place. It is only the second week back since the long summer break but the days are already dragging. We are sitting in one parliament, but watching another. It’s the strangest feeling.And while the ongoing jiggery-pokery in Westminster is gripping, it’s all kicking off in Washington too with the hoo-hah over Trump’s Ukrainian favours. But in Kildare Street there is nothing much to do but stick it out in Brexit limbo, casting a sideways glance towards the White House while humming a small fry’s lament. Nothing to do but wait for the big fish to savage themselves into some sort of a solution.To add to the sense of drift, the Taoiseach is missing for the week, away in the US on official duty. The Tánaiste and a number of Ministers also took off for the States. There was just one reporter on the Oireachtas press gallery for Leaders’ Questions on Wednesday. Heather Humphreys, the Minister for Business, was in the hot seat, taking over for Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, who had done the honours the previous day. “Where’s everyone?” we asked. “Leo’s not here so nobody gives a f***.”Harsh, but honest. It’s not that there is nothing happening at this end. Quite the opposite. The budget is due in a couple of weeks. The shadow of Brexit looms ominously (its impact on Border areas was raised by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald). Heather made all the right noises as indicated on her briefing note. Patients continue to languish on trolleys in hospital corridors. Labour’s Alan Kelly specifically mentioned the unacceptable situation in University Hospital Limerick.“Nobody wants to see anyone on a trolley,” agreed Heather, before reading out the relevant statistics from her briefing.“I thank the Minister for her generic response,” fibbed Alan.Statistics-strewn reply Independent TD Catherine Connolly rowed in with the continuing problems at University Hospital Galway and the gap between “the Government’s commitment to deliver a public health system and the reality on the ground”. Heather read a dry, statistic-strewn reply from her briefing notes, dashing the Galway deputy’s plea for a simple answer. “Please do not give me rhetoric or something I don’t understand.”Catherine got the answer the Minister was given. The Fianna Fáil leader raised last week’s “savage assault” on Kevin Lunney of Quinn Industrial Holdings, an act of “savagery and inhumanity” which shocked the country. The time has come, said Micheál Martin, for the British and Irish governments to set up a special agency “to once and for all root this evil out of the Border region”.The Minister roundly condemned the attack on Mr Lunney, with whom she is acquainted, along with earlier attacks on his colleagues. Loyal to her briefing note, she said the Government would consider Micheál’s proposal, but stressed the existing task force is effective and working well.By sticking to her script and keeping her replies low key before an Opposition content to go through the motions in the Taoiseach’s absence, Heather easily reached her objective of escaping unscathed. Health-related issues There were more health- related issues during Questions on Promised Legislation, but with Minister for Health Simon Harris still on the way back from the US there was nobody from his department to address them. Climate-change questions came up again, but Richard Bruton smothered them effortlessly. Former Sinn Féin TD, now leading Aontú, Peadar Tóibín took an Augustinian approach to the crisis. He asked Bruton to make sure the public transport service in Meath works before he gets involved in any more climate change-related photo ops. Lord, make us good environmentalists but not until we get a full fleet of buses for Navan. Meanwhile, across the Irish Sea, the aftermath of the prime minister’s 11-nil thrashing in the UK supreme court was causing ructions in the House of Commons. Attorney general Geoffrey Cox, Basso Pantomimo in Boris Johnson’s discredited chorus, hammed it up shamelessly in the face of Tuesday’s legal shellacking, roaring: “This parliament is a dead parliament!”Whereupon the listless legions in Leinster House looked around and experienced a collective “Hold me drink!” moment. You think that’s a dead parliament? We’ll show you a dead parliament.Although, upon reflection, that’s not true. The Dáil is merely marking time. Resting its eyes. It may not be as entertaining or alarming, but better behaved and with a beating heart.Near-deserted DáilWhen we couldn’t stop ourselves tuning in to see a rudely unrepentant Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson’s return to Westminster – a matter-of-factly mendacious prime minister forced back to the dispatch box by the highest court in the land, the second stage of the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill 2019 was snoring along in a near-deserted Dáil chamber.It was no match for Johnson’s brazen performance, topping the thigh-slapping music hall melodramatics of his boombastic AG.Back in the Dáil, Minister of State David Stanton was on his feet, talking to the other couple of TDs in the chamber for the second stage of the Criminal Record (Exchange of Information) Bill. The House was due to sit until 10.15pm. If they could stay awake. Switch back to Westminster and for some reason, Johnson was boasting about riding around London without any protection, proving that he can tell the truth when he puts his mind to it. “Cycling around London with no protection whatsoever” were the sludge-gusset’s actual words.A sludge-gusset revelling in his “incontinent goading” of an outraged opposition, as one MP put it. He was still going strong when the Dáil adjourned over an hour ahead of time. The TDs would have been out in time to hear him shout: “Show that we respect the judgment of the people.” What he actually said was: “Respect the judgment of de Pfeffel!”On the way out, we met a weary backbencher, wondering when this Brexit torment will end. “It’s like being 8½ months pregnant for the last three years.”She’ll have to wait. It’s up to the will of de Pfeffel."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4030352.1569436804!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"austrian election sebastian kurz pushes for return to office","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tÖVP chief Sebastian Kurz presses the flesh on the campaign trail in Baden. Photograph: GettySebastian Kurz and the pretty Austrian spa town of Baden are perfect examples of what German speakers call the Projektionsfläche – the projection screen.A century after the Austro-Hungarian monarchy’s collapse the streets of Baden still has stucco-filled facades, a whiff of sulphur in the air and stressed Viennese stalking up and down between spells taking the healing waters, like the Empress Sisi before them.And then there’s Sebastian Kurz. At 33, Austria’s youngest-ever former chancellor is the perfect projection screen for Baden’s conservative voters, longing for the past and uneasy for the future.When Austria elects a new parliament on Sunday, two years after it elected the last, a defining question for 6.4 million voters is whether Kurz should be returned as chancellor.“He’s young and he deserves a chance to change things, the older politicians are just too encrusted and sated,” said Doris Stern, a 72-year-old visitor in Baden from Vienna.\u0026nbspSlick political machineDespite his young years, Kurz is a polished professional and effective communicator with manners as manicured as his signature look: slim-fit suit and no tie.On his watch, Austria’s conservative People’s Party (ÖVP) has been transformed into a catch-all political machine as slick as its leader’s gelled-back hair. The apolitical message blasted at supporters: “Austria needs its chancellor back.”And like an abbatoir that uses every piece of the animal, the optimised ÖVP leader is using every minute of his 14-hour campaigning days to win back power.At rallies here in Baden and elsewhere, he devotes as much time to selfies with supporters – to amplify his brand online – as his stump speech.In between personalised messages direct to their smartphones, voters learn that his ÖVP is the party of balanced budgets, tax cuts and bureaucracy reduction. On climate change – a dominant election issue, he favours e-cars but opposes a CO2 levy as a “punishment exercise for people dependent on their cars to commute”.But he has some explaining to do. Like why, after the 2017 poll, he went into coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). And why he dismissed regular FPÖ scandals – their hardline interior minister, anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim outbursts – as regrettable, one-off missteps.Things came to a head last May, when a secret video emerged showing FPÖ leader and vice-chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache promising a fake oligarch heiress state contracts for party donations.Kurz pulled the coalition plug for a snap election. But his plan of sailing back to power as chancellor was undermined when the FPÖ, out for revenge, helped oust him with a no-confidence vote.Since then a series of scandals has not appeared to harm the ÖVP and Kurz: not the mysterious shredding of party hard drives nor creative accounting that has seen his party’s campaign spend nearly double legal limits. But the Kurz ÖVP is not soaring either.\u0026nbspAt 33 per cent in polls, the conservatives have an 11-point lead on the next party, the Social Democrats (SPÖ), but has gained less than two points on its 2017 election result. And in Baden, Kurz sounds unusually defensive.“The problem of this election is that finishing first is not enough,” he said before the state theatre. “I guarantee you, if there is a majority against us, then it will be used.”Dominant climate issueLast time around Kurz was hailed as a messiah, but now he is treading rather than walking on water.In interviews and debates he refuses to rule out any post-election options for power. The dominant climate issue could see an approach to suspicious Greens he has also mooted a minority government. And he has refused to rule out a return of his controversial alliance with the far right.That’s why migration – although no longer as pressing an issue as 2017 – has not vanished from the election campaign. Kurz reminds voters how, during the 2015 migration crisis, he pushed to close the so-called Balkan Route bringing migrants to Austria and Germany. In these final days of campaigning he has warned darkly that “something is building” on migration. The message: re-elect me or risk a return to chaos.Shrugging off scandal, leaving his political options open and refusing to be pinned down on policy, political analysts say it is very difficult to imagine any other future chancellor than Sebastian Kurz.“The ÖVP is winning voters from the FPÖ,” said Prof Peter Filzmaier, political scientist at the University of Krems. “But it is losing voters to other parties, including the Greens in an election dominated by environmental policy.”Austria’s political wunderkind will have to work hard for a return to power.But with 85 per cent of voters still undecided, Sunday’s elections – and subsequent coalition talks – could bring surprises.“I fear Kurz will just go back in with the FPÖ,” sighs local woman Daniela Arleth. “Or we’ll have failed coalition talks and another election. At this stage, we’re in training.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4030456.1569444103!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what the boris bettel show said about european discourse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLuxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, gestures to an empty podium as he speaks to the press after Boris Johnson  ducked out of a planned news conference pn September 16th.

Perhaps a slice of cake for the “have your cake and eat it” British prime minister?At one point he even addressed the vacant podium as if Johnson were there, dressing him down for causing enormous stress to EU citizens in the UK anxious about their fate.It was good theatre and Johnson did not come out of it well\u0026nbsp– a no-win situation for the British PM who, in truth, would have faced headlines just as awkward about being shouted down if he had opted to stay.But the British media waxed indignant at what it called the “humiliation” of the PM, insisting that Bettel had committed what the Sun called “a shocking breach of protocol”. Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, spoke of the Luxembourg leader “chucking the normal rules of diplomacy out of the window.”Johnson had been “mocked”, “disrespected”, “dunked on”, treated with discourtesy, we were told by various outlets.The assumption is that it was simply not on to engage so politically and bluntly with a head of state who should have been treated with polite deference. Nation state rules in an intergovernmental order. You have to tread softly and treat even Donald Trump politely, however difficult that might be.New paradigmBut times are changing inside the EU. Subtly but surely there has been a shift to a new paradigm. \u0026nbspMEPs have long spoken of their desire to create a single European political space in which debates, parties and leaders engage with each other across national boundaries. And the nature of their discourse is changing, as it clearly did in the recent European elections.Bettel treated Johnson like he would have treated an opposition politician at home, not as a discourtesy but a measure of the successful evolution of that common European space. Not a slight on the UK’s sovereignty – this is still a Union of nation states – but a reflection of the effect of the entanglements of the two states’ national politics in the common space that is the EU.Perhaps most striking was Emmanuel Macron’s campaign in the European elections. He fought the elections not so much against Marine Le Pen but against Italian far-right League leader Matteo Salvini and Hungary’s PM Viktor Orban. Not to mention Donald Trump. Macron publicly berated other leaders from the mainstream for failing to take on the common challenge of populism.Merkel was on board. “Our values mean,” she told a crowd of 6,000 in Zagreb during the election campaign, “that we can be proud of our country and at the same time work to build Europe. ”Salvini also made no bones about the trans-European nature of the fight, telling supporters rallying just days before the vote that they were fighting “the elites and the powers which have occupied this Europe in the name of finance, of multinationals, of the God Money and of uncontrolled immigration: Macron, Merkel, Soros, Juncker.” No mention of Rome.FederalistMacron was careful not to give hostage to those who want to portray him as an out-and-out federalist. Nowhere does he speak of or to “Europeans”, instead referring to the “peoples” of Europe. The challenge is clear: the nation states persist at the heart of Europe but the creation of a common European political identity, culture and space does not have to contradict that.These manifestations of the emergence of that new political identity are as yet only straws in the wind. But I think we have to see this political storm in a Luxembourg teacup in a new light, one that our neighbours certainly don’t understand.“I was astonished and furious,” an irate letter writer to the Yorkshire Post complained, “to see the prime minister of the tiny country of Luxembourg, smaller than the city of Birmingham, treat the PM of our great nation with such utter contempt at a news conference the other day.”Give me a break."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4030249.1569430069!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"janan ganesh democrats have stopped overthinking impeachment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi. Get this impeachment wrong and Democrats throw away an eminently winnable election next year. Photograph: Alex WongGetty ImagesUntil Tuesday, Nancy Pelosi, who turns 80 in March, was honouring the rule that people grow cautious with age. The speaker of the US House of Representatives had balked at the impeachment of Donald Trump over his alleged collusion with Russia. A comparable scandal, in an adjacent country, and suddenly she is nothing like as prudent. Her conversion holds a lesson for enemies of populism everywhere.The US president is alleged to have pressed Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, to investigate Joe Biden and his relatives. Biden happens to be the leading Democratic contender for Trump’s job.The barriers to impeachment have not lowered since “Russiagate”. Conviction of a president still requires a supermajority of the Senate. Voters are still unlikely to thank Democrats for the disruption. In the inevitable crossfire of scurrility with the GOP, Biden’s own reputation is liable to suffer.What has changed is not the calculus of impeachment, then. What has changed is the Democrats’ propensity to calculate. Essentially, the party has stopped overthinking. Rather than second-guess the political consequences of impeachment, their concern is for – do not laugh – the principle.BacklashThey have decided that staying their hand to avoid a backlash would set the tawdriest of examples. A president could thereafter do as he or she wanted and bank on opponents to choose a quiet life over the risks of confrontation. Those risks are awesome, no doubt. Get this impeachment wrong and Democrats throw away an eminently winnable election next year. Anything, though, is better than the pundit-isation of leadership, whereby courses of action are parsed for their second-order effects rather than for their innate rightness. What is necessary in a columnist is unbecoming in an office-holder.After the electoral traumas of recent years, it is natural that liberals lose themselves in game theory about what voters will do in this or that scenario. Natural, but not all that dignified. Hours before Pelosi made her announcement, Britain’s supreme court ruled against the prorogation of parliament by prime minister Boris Johnson. The decision might incite millions against the Brexit-sceptical petitioners. It might set back the European cause in Britain. But who believes it would be cleverer to let a legal principle drop?Brave the costWhether in London or Washington, what liberals are ultimately defending is not any policy but the rule of law: the frame within which a nation paints its politics, not the choice of colours. Protecting the one might entail some sacrifice of the other. Pelosi seems ready to brave the cost. The test is whether she holds to her course if voters revolt.Encouragingly, even Republicans are curious about Ukraine. All of their senators voted for the intelligence committee to receive the whistleblower’s full complaint. These include people who could see Trump flee a robbed bank in a mask and a hooped top with a sack marked “swag” and still doubt his guilt. Something has shifted. Indeed, a mere impeachment inquiry was the minimum that Pelosi could have announced in the circumstances. Withholding one would not just have split her party. It would have been an invitation to presidential nihilism, as well as a moral forfeit. Liberals will fight for the constitution, it would have suggested, as long as it is politic to do so.Niccolò Machiavelli’s supposedly clever advice for leaders was to feign virtue: “The vulgar crowd always is taken by appearances, and the world consists chiefly of the vulgar.” But Trump prospers exactly because he does not bother with a virtuous pretence. He understands that furtiveness and hypocrisy are what disgrace politicians in the electorate’s eyes. Popular wrathOn Monday, he seemed to all but grant some of the claims against him. An unabashed man cannot be all that guilty, millions will think, and any laws he broke must have been trivial anyway.The point is that democracy is not a foolproof check on power. Legal and constitutional protocols have to supplement the ballot. This is true even if they incur popular wrath. Perhaps impeachment will be the last glory of Pelosi’s career. Perhaps it will doom her party in 2020. Either way, the speaker is not a commentator or an adviser. She is third in line to the world’s highest office. There is a limit to how much she can war-game matters of principle.Trump’s alleged hunt for “kompromat” came after her decision not to impeach him the first time. Liberals have been afraid of their own shadows for years now. They might worry more about what they are inviting. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Transcript of Donald Trump\u0026#39s Ukraine phone call shows he pushed for investigation into Joe BidenDame Emma Thompson admits she \u0026#39may well be hypocritical\u0026#39 for flying but says she travels by air \u0026#39much less\u0026#39Midwives failing to check babies heart rates is biggest cause of birth blunders in the NHS  Over a quarter of secondary school children now have private tutorsSlow eco-friendly washing machine cycles put more plastic in the environment, tests showBoris Johnson condemned after saying best way to honour Jo Cox is \u0026#39to get Brexit done\u0026#39Prisoners use buckets as toilets in \u0026#39slop out\u0026#39 practice supposed to have been banned over a decade agoMen with fertility struggles far more likely to develop prostate cancerDoc Martin, series 9 episode 1 review: The grump returns as unchallenging yet entertaining as everChildren as young as seven view porn online because of lack of age checks, chief censor revealsI was targeted by Welsh nationalists at university, Prince Charles revealsLabour to scrap controls on immigration and hand foreign nationals the right to voteWhy Nancy Pelosi\u0026#39s political gamble over Trump impeachment is not guaranteed to pay offDay of the \u0026#39dead\u0026#39 Parliament: How Geoffrey Cox set the tone as anger poured off the Commons benchesComment: Remainers have turned Parliament into an anti-democratic monstrosityComment: From the rule of law, to the rule of lawyersSeventy dangerous prisoners transferred after riot at high security jail hit by shortages of experienced staffComment: Geoffrey Cox is right – this Parliament is a disgraceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/04/12/stand1.jpg","title":"apple mac pro release date china tariff texas manufacturing","story":"Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Premium free for 1 monthSee the optionsCompany did not say when new desktop would arriveApple says it will build the new Mac Pro in Texas, as it prepares for the release of what will be its most poweful ever computer.The long-anticipated desktop was announced at Apple\u0027s Worldwide Developers Conference earlier this year, when it showed off a strange design and high price that included a $999 stand.It was the first Mac Pro that Apple announced since 2013, when it showed off its trashcan computer that then went on without an update for years.Now Apple says that the new computer will be made in the US, just like the one it replaces.

This is how our interactions in VR and AR can one day look. It can change the way we connect.”Mr Bosworth goes on to explain exactly how this technology works, stating: “You have neurons in your spinal cord that send electrical signals to your hand muscles telling them to move in specific ways such as to click a mouse or press a button.“The wristband will decode those signals and translate them into a digital signal your device can understand, empowering you with control over your digital life.”Following Facebook\u0027s announcement of the acquisition, CTRL-Labs shared a message across its social media platforms that it is thrilled  to join Facebook Reality Labs, however not everyone was happy about the news.Recent scandals involving how Facebook handles and uses people\u0027s personal data raised some questions about the ethics of such technology being used by the company.Great for them, disappointing for the rest of us, wrote tech analyst Azeem Azhar. Facebook needs to inveigle itself into our lives less, not more.CTRL-Labs’ wristband is not the only brain-computer interface that Facebook will be working on, having already unveiled a headset capable of transferring a person’s thoughts directly onto a computer screen.A paper describing the mind-reading technology was published in\u0026nbspNature Communications\u0026nbspearlier this year, revealing how the headset can decode brain activity to instantly transcribe what a person is saying into digital text.“We’re standing on the edge of the next great wave of human-oriented computing,” Facebook said at the time.\u0026nbsp“One in which the combined technologies of AR and VR converge and revolutionise how we interact with the world around us – as well as the ways in which we workm play, and connect.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But each app must ensure they actually turn it on, or they will just look as they always do.Instagram has not yet done that. It means that users scrolling through their otherwise dark phone can open Instagram and be suddenly hit by a blazing light white design, which can be especially painful when scrolling at night.Twitter is full of users requesting that Instagram finally add the feature, comparing opening Instagram to having the curtains pulled open after sitting in the dark.Now Instagram appears to be finally testing it out, giving some people access to a dark mode that will automatically switch on if a phone has the setting turned on in their phone\u0027s options.The dark mode appears to leave the rest of the design largely similar. The colours of the app remain unchanged, and photographs look no different Instagram\u0027s dark mode simply swaps the bright white that is usually behind posts and stories and swaps it for a much darker colour.To get the update, users need to be on the latest version of iOS and Android as wel as the latest version of Instagram, as well as having the dark mode option chosen in the system\u0027s settings. But not everyone in that position appears to be able to get access to it, with the test rolling out gradually.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its journey means that it will be nearby for much longer, giving astronomers a chance to observe it more fully and hopefully understand more of its story.Scientists perplexed by mysterious alien space rock2IBorisov\u0026nbspwas first seen at the end of August by\u0026nbspGennady\u0026nbspBorisov, from Crimea. He noticed that it appeared to be a comet, based on the haze that surrounded it, and he turned out to be right\u0026nbsp– since comets tend to be named after the person who first spotted them, it was given his name.That distinctive tail is helping astronomers understand more about how the comet is making its way through the universe. Its current orbit suggests that it will be flying around the solar system for months, coming close to the Sun on 7 December and then flying out of the solar system.During that time, astronomers are scanning the visitor to learn as much as they can about it. That could help illuminate its origin and its destination, more about what it is made of, and how it could have been sent all the way to us – questions that could not be fully answered about Oumuamua, since it was spotted so late and was already heading out of the solar system before researchers could turn their attention to it fully.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I suspect the Neolithic ones were used for the same purpose but we can’t confirm that until we’ve examined them,” said Dr Dunne.\u0026nbspWeaning a child earlier using animal milk could have helped counteract a period of infertility that can happen when a mother breastfeeds.\u0026nbspHunter-gatherers were having children about once every five years yet early agriculturalists were probably having them every couple of years.\u0026nbspScientists believe\u0026nbspthese little vessels could help explain why there was a ‘baby boom’ during the Neolithic period.Seidl da Fonseca)Dr Dunne said: “Humans become agriculturalists and they start growing cereals. Once people are settled and they’ve got food on tap to feed babies they start having more babies and more often. Fertility increases which then leads to a baby boom and a massive increase in the population.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The items were found next to children between zero and six years old.\u0026nbspEach one was between five and 10cm across and had an extremely narrow spout that fitted inside the baby’s mouth. Because the spouts are so small it has been difficult to determine what they contained and before analysing them researchers thought they could have been used to nourish sick adults or the elderly.\u0026nbspExpert reconstructs face of 4,000-year-old Neolithic dogTo understand what was inside them researchers did a chemical analysis on the fatty acids from animal products. They found two of the vessels had been used for milk from a ruminant animal (cattle, sheep or goats) whereas the other was non-ruminant milk (probably from a pig or human).The study, published in Nature, is the first research to look at how infants were weaned in these prehistoric cultures. Similar vessels have been found in ancient Rome and Greece and researchers would now like to investigate whether they served the same purpose. \u0026nbspScientists say the study provides a crucial insight into the diet of children in prehistoric human populations.\u0026nbsp“Bringing up babies in prehistory was not an easy task. We are interested in researching cultural practices of mothering, which had profound implications for the survival of babies,” said researcher Dr Katharina Rebay-Salisbury from the Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology at the Austrian Academy of Sciences.“It is fascinating to be able to see, for the first time, which foods these vessels contained,” she said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unchecked, they could break into the Sacramento-San Joaquin river delta in central California, which provides drinking water for some 10 million people, as well as irrigation and flood protection.“It sounds ridiculous, but these swamp rats are actually a major problem for our water infrastructure. They can cause floods by destroying irrigation canals and levees,” said Democratic congressman Josh Harder earlier this year.Now, armed with $10m (£8m)\u0026nbspin state funds, rangers are deploying new tactics to eradicate the nutria and try to prevent the widespread destruction they are known to cause.“Over the past two years, our best efforts were trying to not even control the population but keep it from exploding while we pursued the resources needed to actually pursue eradication,” said Valerie Cook, from the California fish and wildlife department’s eradication programme.“We haven’t had nutria in California for 50 years, so nobody really knows much about them,” Peter Tira, a department spokesman,\u0026nbspsaid. “We’ve had to learn on the job as we go.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The area is the US’ most productive agricultural region, responsible for more than half its\u0026nbspfruit, vegetables and nuts, including almost all apricots, table grapes, carrots, asparagus and tree nuts.Damage to the region, whose output was estimated in government figures to have been $29bn (£23bn) in 2017, would be disastrous for its economy and diet.“It would mean no more sushi, because the alternative would be to buy rice from Japan or Korea, where the price is five times higher,” said Daniel Sumner, director of the Agricultural Issues Centre\u0026nbspat the University of California-Davis. “Kiss off carrots, or live without table grapes in the summertime.”Additional reporting by Associated PressShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The tribunal found evidence they were “being used as a bank of organs” and subjected to regular medical testing.China has repeatedly denied the use of unethical organ transplant practices, and said that it stopped using the organs from executed prisoners in 2015. In a statement earlier this year, it accused the London-based China Tribunal of perpetuating “rumours”.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester fires at riot police during university students\u0027 protest outside the Indonesian Parliament in JakartaRussia\u0027s Soyuz-FG booster rocket with the Soyuz MS-15 space ship that will carry new crew to the International Space Station (ISS) is transported from its hangar to the launch pad at the Russian leased Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan.

Sir Geoffrey called on the International Transplant Society and national medical associations dealing with transplant surgery to “face up to what is revealed in the China Tribunal judgment and act”.\u0026nbspSome countries, including Italy, Spain, Israel and Taiwan, already have restrictions in place for those seeking to travel to China for organ transplant surgery.And the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (Etac), which initiated the China Tribunal, said it expects a private members bill to stop unethical organ tourism will be tabled in the UK parliament in October.Etac is hoping its findings will prompt the Human Rights Council to open up a UN Commission of Inquiry into forced organ harvesting in China, said Susie Hughes, the organisation’s executive director.In his speech, Mr Sabi said\u0026nbspthat the targeting of minority groups for organ harvesting amounted to a “possible charge of genocide”, and compared it to other examples of mass religious or racial persecution in recent history.“Victim for victim and death for death, the gassing of the Jews by the Nazis, the massacre by the Khmer Rouge or the butchery to death of the Rwanda Tutsis may not be worse than cutting out the hearts and other organs from living, blameless, harmless, peaceable people,” he told the Human Rights Council. “It is the legal obligation of UN Member States to address this criminal conduct.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu’s\u0026nbspparty won 32 seats.\u0026nbspBut the incumbent prime minister secured the backing of more lawmakers than\u0026nbsphis rival, albeit with equally tight margins, with Mr Gantz\u0026nbspsecuring 54 and Mr Netanyahu\u0026nbspsecuring 55.The question now is whether the prime minister will be able to form a coalition, or whether the deep isions between Israel’s political parties will force another election, which would be the third in just one year.The president has impressed upon both sides that an election should be avoided at all costs, telling both men: “People expect you to find a solution and to prevent further elections, even if it comes at a personal and even ideological cost.”Mr Gantz’s party said that while they were\u0026nbsp“committed to the principle of unity” they could not enter into government if Mr Netanyahu is kept as leader, as he faces indictment in three corruption cases next month.Mr Gantz added: “Blue and White, led by me, does not agree to sit in a government whose leader is facing a severe indictment.\u0026nbsp This issue, among a number of other critical factors, is more important to us than any delegation of ministerial posts or a rotation.”Mr Netanyahu, who\u0026nbsphas signed a deal with smaller allies including ultra-Orthodox parties, will struggle to form a coalition.\u0026nbspFormer ally\u0026nbspAvigdor Lieberman\u0026nbspcriticised Mr Netanyahu and urged him to be more flexible in talks. He won eight\u0026nbspseats in the election but has so far refused to join either side.\u0026nbspThe ex-defence minister and now head of the\u0026nbspultranationalist\u0026nbspYisrael\u0026nbspBeiteinu\u0026nbspparty had called for a secular unity government that excluded the prime minister’s religious allies, a demand Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu\u0026nbsphas rejected.\u0026nbspPresident Rivlin meanwhile added in his statement that he had offered several suggestions to help with the “legal complications” the country faced, in a veiled reference to Mr Netanyahu’s likely court proceedings.He suggested the appointment of an interim prime minister who would take over if the premier was “unable to fulfil his role”, it also added that the law could be amended to put a 100-day limit on the prime minister’s leave of absence.Tamara Wittes, senior fellow in the Center for Middle East Policy at Brookings, told The Independent that the question will now be how strongly the various political parties will hold on to their campaign principles.“Lieberman said he will only join a unity government with the two major parties. Does he mean it, or might Netanyahu be able to entice him back into a right-wing coalition? Blue and White said they would not sit in a government with Likud headed by Netanyahu — will they really insist on his departure as the price of unity, even if it means a third election?”, she said.\u0026nbsp“The Likud MKs and all the parties to its right swore loyalty to Bibi as the head of their bloc. Do they mean it, or will they be willing to throw him over to avoid a third election? These are the questions.“Gantz seems to be banking on Lieberman holding his ground, meaning Bibi will fail to form a government of the right and will have to come to Gantz hat in hand. We shall see if that bet pays off.”Blue and White Party\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

My copies of the files will never be released unless something untoward happens to me.”When asked by the Mail Online about what information he has on the Prince, Dougan said: Do I have dirt on Prince Andrew  I have lots of things.But Im not a Kremlin agent and I did not share any materials with the Russian Government. I dont intend to blackmail anyone with my information.

I do not have a physical copy in my immediate possession, because of security reasons.The files are safe and the people who hold them have no idea what is on them.The Times has reported that MI is worried about how much Dougan knows of the original police investigation into the paedo’s activities .It is particularly concerned what information the ex-cop might have already shared with spooks in Russia.An unnamed source told the paper: “His knowledge of the Epstein case would have been of great interest to Russian intelligence.”One of the girls trafficked by Epstein was Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claimed she was flown to London and had sex with Andrew when she was . Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I cant rememberTyrone or she mentioned that she was dating a footballer.She mentioned she was upset with the way she was treated by him. She wanted to expose him to his missus or something like that.We discussed what she could do. She had a few options. I mentioned to her she could sell it to newspapers.Rowe said the plan was to take incriminating footage of Wood with the footballer in the hotel room.He added: Basically we would enter the room, get a recording of the footballer and Natalie in a compromising position and then leave.I was sceptical about the whole thing. I was actually surprised when I entered the room and saw it was actually the footballer.Rowe said he asked Tyrone Coleman to send him the video so he could show it to friends who had contacts with the media.He claimed he was handed the footballers tracksuit by Wood after they left the hotel room and said he later found a £, Rolex watch and wallet inside it.I just panicked, he said. I didnt want to get myself into trouble or anyone  into trouble.Under cross-examination, Rowe said they wanted to sell the story to The Sun but did not know how much it would be worth to the newspaper.Simon Jones, prosecuting, suggested: The reality is you knew you could earn big money from . Thats why you were going to go to the media You are motivated by money Rowe, who said he owned a vape shop and did not need the money, replied: To a certain extent.He insisted the tracksuit, which still had tags on, was handed to him by Wood who told him she had purchased it for the footballer.Rowe said: I was never going to keep the Rolex, I was going toit.Rowe also said it had never crossed my mind about whether the footballer would be wealthy.Mr Jones said: The truth, I suggest, is that you came up with the idea to get an image of him and use that image to sell to the newspaper and what you were going on to discuss with Tyrone and Nathan was how you could threaten him.If you were in the room and filming him and had footage on a mobile phone, you could demand there and then the money to keep you quiet.This is all part of a very detailed blackmail plot, was it not Rowe replied: No, not at all.I was planning to exposeto the media and expose him to his missus.The jury of nine women and three men has heard a police investigation was launched after the footballer ran into a nearby restaurant in his underwear.Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of thefts relating to the Rolex watch and designer tracksuit.His brother Tyrone Coleman, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail.Rowe, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.Ras Robinson denies a charge of handling stolen goods relating to the watch.The trial continues."},{"url":null,"title":"zoo reopens new animals charity cash close down","story":"Rafah Zoo in Gaza was slammed after disturbing pictures revealed dozens of emaciated lions, monkeys, and peacocks living in cramped cages.The zoo agreed to close and accepted more than £, from Vienna-based animal charity Four Paws to pay for food and medical treatment until the animals could be moved.In April, the animals were sedated and moved  miles to a new home in Jordan via Israel, which gave special permission for the land transfer.But the zoo is now reported to have reopened and keeping lions, ostriches, and monkeys, again in tiny cages.Four Paws hit out at the development and received assurances from the zoo owners that it would close once the transfer of animals had been completed.Martin Bauer, a spokesperson for the charity, told Central European News: Of course we are disappointed that it has reopened after promising to close, and it now rests in the hands of local authorities to act because, as far as we know, the newly opened zoo has no licence.Of course,local officials confiscate the animals, we would be prepared to enter into talks about assisting in their rescue and relocating in a more species-appropriate habitat.But we need to move away from the circle of paying each time to rescue the animals in a kind of hostage situation.Of the lions now being kept in the zoo, two are fully-grown and three are cubs.Recent visitors to the zoo report seeing staff trying to separate lion cubs from their mothers users sticks so that customers could be photographed with them.They also said ostriches were being kept in tiny cages and were constantly pecking at their bars, and that monkeys could be seen eating rubbish off the floor.New manager Ashraf Jumaa, who is thought to be related to the people who promised to close the zoo, denied the zoo was trying to blackmail charities for more money.Our main objective is not trade but entertainment, and we decided to reopen because that was what local people wanted, he said.But he admitted that the zoo would be unable to afford to feed all its lions once the cubs began to grow.He said the fully-grown lions would need -kg of meat a day, which they would not be able to cover given current visitor numbers.Gaza continues to suffer economically under a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by Israel after militant organisation Hamas took control of the strip in .Around half of Gazas two million people are estimated to live below the poverty line.A spokesman for the Gaza agriculture ministry said they had not discussed the reopening with anyone at the zoo, and that there was little likelihood the necessary land could be made available for a zoo to meet international standards.Four Paws has said that the current cages sizes are completely unacceptable and that the animals were in need of better food and medical care.Local animal rights activist Mohammed Aweda cast doubt on the prospect of a further rescue, saying there was already a debate about whether the last payment should be counted as animal trading."},{"url":null,"title":"affinity water declared drought britains wettest day","story":"As forecasters issued a “danger to le” warning due to flash floods, Affinity Water even threatened

The least we can do is take care of those they leave behind.These failings are immoral and they are a direct assault on military effectiveness and therefore the defence of our country.Why  Because they corrode the morale of our servicemen and women.However many ultra-sophisticated aircraft carriers, F combat fighters, tanks and missiles we supply, the morale of the fighting man will always remain the cornerstone of combat power.High morale achieves miracles in battle, low morale leads to disaster and defeat.Low morale also makes people vote with their feet, signing off for civilian jobs where they will be properly looked after.This helps explain the woeful undermanning in the forces today, where recruiting has failed miserably to keep up with outflow.Yet a government that hopes to plug the gaping hole by increasing recruitment of soldiers from the Commonwealth shoots itself in both feet. It has made it virtually impossible for many recruits to be joined here by their families due to petty bureaucracy that could be overcome at a stroke.The Sun’s Never Forget Them campaign led the Government in July to create an Office for Veterans’ Affairs, with direct access to the Cabinet, with a new minister for Defence People and Veterans heading it.At the same time the PM promised the Government would: “Do all it can to support our Armed Forces from the day they enlist and for the rest of their lives.”No one expects overnight transformation.But after two months we have not heard one single new idea on tackling all of these age-old problems from the minister, Johnny Mercer.Mr Mercer is no ordinary politician. He’s a distinguished and courageous former soldier who fought in Afghanistan during three tours of duty and a man who I and many veterans admire and respect.He went “on strike” during Theresa May’s premiership in protest at the prosecution of British troops over historical allegations from the Northern Ireland campaign.Yet only last week we witnessed the opening of a murder trial against an elderly former soldier for alleged crimes in Londonderry half a century ago.Mr Mercer could not have done anything to prevent this.But he has not explained to the public how he intends to halt the disgraceful hounding of veterans through the courts in what is the greatest betrayal of their own Armed Forces by any government in history.In response to the Defence Committee report Mr Mercer tweeted: “I will offer a private informal session to the committee and update on every single issue raised.”Such discretion would be the way of a soldier but it is not what we expect from political leaders.The British public, as well as serving soldiers and veterans, are outraged by the abuse of our troops and those who have served.What we demand is to be told about solutions that will be actioned as soon as possible.Mr Mercer has experience of the issues raised in the latest report and served on the Defence Committee.Since entering Parliament in  he has campaigned energetically to sort out the plight of both servicemen and veterans, describing it as his main mission.If he was new to the forces’ problems we could understand he might need time to gain understanding and consider possible options.But he was selected because he has a deep understanding and experience and should have been able to announce his programme on day one.I worked at the centre of government for years and know the quagmire that confronts a minister trying to fight through a bureaucracy resistant to change and adept at wielding the civil service machinery that exists to frustrate progress.But Mr Mercer must find the resolve to overcome these obstacles. He should adopt Churchill’s dictum of “action this day”.There is no time for private briefings, blusterings and paralysis.Our troops are deployed on operations around the globe today. And who knows when the next intense battle will begin, whether over Russian expansion, Iranian aggression, or Chinese provocation, or something totally unforeseen We expect our fighting men and women to lay down their livesnecessary.It is vital that the Government and Mr Mercer do everything they can totheir courage and dedication in deeds as well as words.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While a large percentage of the younger generation are genuinely concerned about the planet — and rightly so — how many of them are actually going to do their bit beyond the enviable opportunity to skip school on a sunny day and virtue signal with a hand-made banner Deliciously tempting though it may be to blame their parents, the simple truth is that up to  years ago, no one had even heard of climate change.Far from worrying about the planet heating up, I distinctly remember our geography teacher telling us that a mini ice age was coming.In the meantime, I walked or cycled to school every day, wore jumpers indoors in winter because we didn’t have central heating and baked in the stling heat of the summer of ’ in classrooms without the luxury of air-con.There were no ready meals, we ate simple food cooked by mothers who had grown up with rationing, the vast supermarkets of today didn’t exist and we didn’t have a freezer.The only “takeaway” in easy reach was a fish and chip shop and the first time we ever ate out was when I scraped a couple of O-level passes and my mum took me to the local Berni Inn to celebrate.Our milk came in glass bottles, we ate locally grown, seasonal fruit and vegetablesand I didn’t set eyes on an avocado or any other exotic foodstuff until well into adulthood.At school, I was taught to mend things, not throw them away, would wear something several times before my mother would even think about washing it, and only received new clothesat Christmas or on birthdays.We had one TV, didn’t even get a landline until I was and I didn’t go abroad until I was  — by boat, not plane.No one went on “a gap yah” and my mum would have killed meI left our tent at Glastonbury, because we used it for holidays in Wales.I could go on, but the younger generation’s collective eye-roll of boredom might cause a damaging tremor.Suffice to say,today’s kids are happy to strip their lives back to reflect the childhood we had, it would be a great step towards helping the planet. But it’s not going to happen.So, instead of the lame, “old people have ruined everything for young people”, mantra, all generations should be working together to not only do their bit at homebut to continue putting pressure on those who govern us and have the power to effect realistic, not idealistic, change for a planet that currently accommodates seven and a half billion people.Then the admirable young Greta can go back to school and get on with having a normal le.THE Duchess of Sussex has learned the hard way that making inclusive speeches and appearing accessible has its pitfalls.In other words, someone might ask you to dance. When everyone’s watching.Shortly after declaring to the people of Nyanga, in South Africa: “I am here with you as . . . a woman of colour and as your sister,” she was grabbed by the hand to take part in a traditional dancing display, an offer she could then hardly refuse.From memory, the inscrutable Queen’s “don’t touch me” demeanour has thus far prevented her from being urged to participate in anything beyond a bit of heavily stage-managed ribbon-cutting, but her more modern-minded children have had their dignity sorely tested by many a tribal dance.Prince Charles’s awkward sword dance in Saudi Arabia springs to mind, and the rictus “please make it stop” grins of William and Kate when shimmying with the locals on the Pacic island of Tuvalu in .But Meghan pulled off her global dance debut with cheery aplomb, rhythmically wiggling her hips in time to the music and deftly moving on before it got too eggy.As Strictly’s Craig might say: “Fab-u-louuuus, dahling.”Consequently, he and we Adele live “mostly on benefits” in a Brighton council house along with their three young children.Thankfully, working hard is in the psyche of the majority, so luckily for him we help pay for his self-indulgent lestyle choice.JAMES Anderson has been dubbed “Britain’s kindest plumber” after fixing the boilers of the elderly for free.James, , above, from Burnley, risked going bankrupt but is now hoping to extend his services across the country after receiving £, in public donations.A truly heart-warming story.But why don’t councils nationwide use cash from their parking fine coffers to employ a “James” to help the needy in their area It would be a far better use of our money than some of the daft initiatives they come up with.AROUND  per cent of us hide treats so they don’t get eaten by our partners or kids.The top ten hiding places include under the bed and in the car.Puh, amateurs.Mine’s the back of the vegetable drawer.A record  people took part and celebrated with a BBQ straight afterwards.DEMI Moores newly released memoir reveals she engaged in threesomes while married to fellow actor Ashton Kutcher.“I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be,” she says.Ah, yes, the perils of an age-gap relationship and the continual struggle to appear “on the same page” as your much younger partner.Ashton was  to Demi’s  when they met in  and, no doubt, his sex drive was at its optimum while hers was perhaps struggling for air under the pressure of bringing up her three children with former husband Bruce Willis.While you fancy a night in with a boxset and some Pinot, he’s wanting to leave the house at pm for a night of clubbing and group sex.No thanks.And don’t even get me started on all the times you’d talk about David Cassidy and they’d reply: “Who ”ACCORDING to SNP MP Joanna Cherry: “The UK Supreme Court has made the ruling necessary to restore democracy and the rule of law.”She adds: “Now politicians must make sure that ruling is respected.”What, in the same way they respected the democratic vote to leave the EU Sigh.

Although he officially retired from public le in the late s, the Archbishop continues to advocate for social justice and equality across the globe.He has written several books over the years,

agenda","story":"First the BBC soap posted its lowest ever ratings, .million viewers for an episode back in June, and now respected BBC commentator Mark Lawson has pointed out the show, along with Coronation Street and Emmerdale, has become outlandish and ­unsustainable on account of the ludicrous number of rape victims and murderers.And that’s before you even start trying to calculate the number of Walford characters who’ve been abducted.Personally, though, I don’t ­remember a time when EastEnders was anything other than the most deranged show on television.I would’ve thought more obvious signs it had lost the plot would be Ben Mitchell’s six ­dferent heads, Phil Mitchell’s ­people smuggling operation with Barry Grant off Brookside and the surprisingly high number of ­characters who revealed they were gay in time for the opening of the show’s new LGBT bar.Which has to be the happiest ­EastEnders coincidence since The Queen Vic organised a “European night,” not long after the Brexit vote.It’s good to have your prejudices ­questioned, though, so I watched with added care last week to seeI’d been missing a trick, as the Square came to terms with the bloody aftermath of the pub siege.Hunter’s still dead, thankfully, but Keanu’s made a remarkable recovery from being shot at point blank range and Bex is up for something called a “Pride of Walford award.” The real focus of the drama, however, was Bobby Beale, who’s freshly released from prison and so traumatised he’s prone to taking drugs and wandering off into train tunnels.As would youyou’d killed your sister and undergone four head transplants.The cure for all this ­torment is classic EastEnders and actually a bit easier to believe than the idea Ian Beale’s new lodger is Rainie, the ­prostitute he had sex with the night daughter Lucy was killed.Bobby’s embraced Islam.He says: “It helps me see the good in people.”The show says it is “to counter negative representations of Islam.”No word on why these representations might be negative, of course, just as EastEnders never had any dramatic response or even a mention of ­Islamist terror attacks in London or three East End schoolgirls running away to join IS.Bobby’s story exists in a soap vacuum.It’s a no-context approach that treats the viewers as dangerous idiots, of course, but wouldn’t grate quite so much­EastEnders had a blanket approach to all religions.It doesn’t, though. Only a ­couple of weeks ago some Christian “End is nigh” nutter was roaming the market and the show had no qualms about introducing Rev Lucas Johnson, who was driven to kill by his Christianity.This slanted agenda defines EastEnders as much as all its murders, rapes and abductions.The only thing that’s changed here, since the dawn of time , is the amount of ­scrutiny and competition it gets, which, given that ratings have recovered, means the misery will probably continue indefinitely.Still, on the positive side, Adam Woodyatt’s tenderloin of Iberico pork, with parsnip three ways, has seen him through to the next round of Celebrity MasterChef.#PrideOfWalford.Sent in by the brilliant Reenie E.Picture research: Marta Ovod.STRICTLY Come Dancing came out of the traps like Johnny Vegas on the opening leg of a x metres relay on Saturday.Two weeks they’ve been rehearsing and viewers still aren’t trusted enough to vote.Instead, the contestants laid out their nervous credentials over  testing minutes.“Eighteen years in the Premiership and I’ve never been as nervous as . . . ”We know, we know.There was an awful lot of “great energy” flannel from the judges as well, including Craig Revel Horwood, who needs to ignore any “be more positive” instructions.This ’s already compromised enough by the fact Motsi Mabuse’s sister Oti has – by accident rather than design – ended up with Kelvin Fletcher, who’s one of the favourites.Mercully, there are two dancers no amount of “great energy” can save. One is James Cracknell, whose tango had more than a touch of the Boris Karloffs about it.The other is BBC reporter Mike Bushell, who did a sailor’s hornpipe to The Contours with double nork-grab to finish, accompanied by the insatiable Katya Jones, who sounds like she still won’t take no for an answer.“Even when I was in bed, next to my we,” complained Mike, “Katya’s saying, ‘Give me five, give me five, give me five’.”Mike.

Grant Shapps was slammed for his comment during an urgent Commons debate as it emerged the failed holiday giant owed its suppliers £million. Taxpayers are now facing a redundancy bill for Thomas Cook’s , UK workers and a £million bill for repatriating , stranded holidaymakers. Mr Shapps said: “Our concern was we would put £million at risk and thrown away good money after bad, then still have to pay for this ­repatriation.”    But Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said the Government “sat back and let the company fold”. Pressure is piling on the Tories after it emerged Turkey and Spain had off­­ered big investments to help Thomas Cook. But Mr Shapps insisted that Turkey made no approach and the travel firm was “not viable” by the time Spain made its offer. The TSSA union’s Manuel Cortes said: “The public deserves to know whether our Government was negligent in not acting to safeguard Thomas Cook.”Court documents filed this week show the firm had a deficit of £billion – with £.billion of debt and nearly £million owed to suppliers. It had £million in the bank. Swiss chief executive Peter Fankhauser, , concluded in the documents that the firm would “run out of cash” by October  “andprobably earlier”. He and other ex-bosses were criticised after directors were revealed to have shared £million in pay andperks since .Mr Shapps said an Insolvency Service probe would look at the role of directors and had powers to recoup bonuses. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook customers have reported price rises when trying to book new breaks.

Almost , customers have been brought home on  flights by the Civil Aviation Authority in the first two days since the travel firm collapsed. But despite the swt £million effort, not everyone has been able toto the UK airport from which they originally left for their holiday. It means , passengers so far have had onward travel arranged by the CAA after, in some cases, being flown hundreds of miles from home. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed an extra flight to Glasgow from Londonaposs Gatwick had been laid on “to relocate passengers who have flown back to the wrong airport because of that scheduling issue”. Tory minister Mr Shapps today praised the swt and decisive response to Thomas Cookaposs collapse, which will involve repatriating , Brits in  countries using , flights over the next fortnight.    A further , passengers hope to repatriate today on about  flights, he told the House of Commons. Mr Shapps said % of people have been repatriated to original point of departure. But he admitted: We haven’t been able to bring everybody back to the airport from which they left, because of the dference of size and shape of those aircraft that are available.” Despite the glitch, Mr Shapps said the rescue effort was going well after , calls to customer service lines and million visitors to website on the first day. This has been an unprecedented response to an unprecedented situation, he told MPs. “We’ve never had the collapse of an airline or a holiday company on this scale before. We’ve responded swtly and decisively.  Right now our efforts are rightly focused on getting those passengers home and looking after those employees who’ve lost their jobs. But we also need to understand whether any iniduals have failed in their duties of stewardship within the company.” It came as MPs argued over the causes of the firmaposs collapse, huge bonuses paid to bosses before it went under, and who is to blame. Mr Shapps said that bailing out the troubled travel firm would have been throwing good money after bad that may not have averted repatriation costs. However, he said the Government will look at whether bonuses paid to Thomas Cookaposs executives can be recovered through the insolvency process. Tory Robert Halfon said: My constituents have lost their jobs, the directors go back to their million-pound-plus houses. Theyaposve taken £ million in bonuses and wages over the past few years.

Issues with the visa process has left Syeda in Dubai while Azhar, who is British, is at home from Birmingham. Because the couple had not been planning on delivering the baby in Dubai and because Syeda was on a student visa - making obtaining maternity insurance impossible - they did not have health care coverage.    Syeda said: My husband, who works in the UK, is suffering terribly from this and cannot be with me as we require six payslips to be able to re-apply for a visa again. The couple, who married in December, fear that by the time Amal is ready to leave the hospital the medical bill could have risen to £,.In a bid to get the money together Azhar and Syeda set up a Go Fund Me page , which has raised close to £, so far.On the page they wrote: The hospital have threatened legal action and the doctor has advised they won’t give us our daughter back until the bill is totally cleared.

Martins Erdmanis had been drinking alcohol ahead of the easyJet flight from Budapest to Manchester at .am on September  this year.As soon as the -year-old entered the plane he fell over, one witness said, before he stumbled around and bumped into passengers attempting to take their seats, Manchester Evening News reported.Once he sat down he produced a bottle of Grey Goose vodka and started pouring it into orange cartons, Manchester Magistrates Court heard. Erdmanis, from Birmingham, was described as being completely out of it.    He befriended another person on the aircraft who appeared to be drunk as well, prosecutor Steven Woodman said. The female passenger and a male passenger with her heard them making a number of comments about females on board. He was asked to place the bottle of vodka in the overhead compartment but he said he would not. The couple sat beside Erdmanis complained to staff about the comments he and another man were making. They were shocked when he shouted you snitch at them before unleashing a volley of slurs. The cabin crew asked the pairthey were ok and they were moved to another part of the plane, the prosecutor added. The passenger said she welled up because she was so angry and frustrated at having to put up with that behaviour. The cabin crew asked the pilot to call for the police on arrival at Manchester Airport. Erdmanis, who is currently unemployed, and the other male were both arrested as the plane landed.    Police recorded that he smelt heavily of intoxicant and was very unsteady on his feet. He explained to officers that he did not know that being drunk on a plane was illegal before admitting having had half a bottle of vodka. Defending, Peter Broderick said his client made full admissions at interview and was not the more rowdy of the two males. This was an unsavoury incident and it is not a nice thing for sober passengers to be around, the lawyer said. He was in Budapest with his friends to see a pop concert. He was drunk when he got on the plane and had a bottle of vodka which he was drinking on the plane. To his credit he is a gentleman with no previous criminal record. I would submit that the unsavoury comments were made by the other party and not this defendant.

Richard Keedwell embarked on a long and incredibly expensive legal journey back in  when he drove his Nissan Qashqai to the shops in Worcester to pick up some Christmas gts. A speed camera clocked the vehicle as going  mph.A couple of days later the -year-old received a fine for £, which sparked a strong reaction in Mr Keedwell, Bristol Post reported.He said: “Incredulity. I was pretty certain I hadn’t broke the limit.    “I have only had three or four tickets in more than  years of driving.” After asking and getting photographic evidence from West Mercia Police, he showed the photos to a friend of a friend, Tim Farrow. The former RAF man had worked with radar cameras back in the s and explained a Double Doppler has occurred - when a radar beam bounces off one object onto another.  “There was a Volkswagen Golf in the middle lane of New Road while I was on the right, Mr Keedwell said. If some of the beam bounces off that car onto mine, it causes a distorted camera reading.”    Armed with a sense of injustice and the willingness to spend a few grand, the irate motorist took the government on. Mr Keedwell appeared before Worcester Magistratesapos Court four times and took the case to Worcester Crown Court on appeal last month. Unfortunately for the pensioner the judge ruled in favour of the Crown Prosecution Service. In making sure his case got a fair hearing Mr Keedwell forked out £, on barristeraposs fees and £, in court costs, on top of travel costs. Mr Farrow, who was his key witness, failed to convince the judge with the Double Doppler defence.    The district judge who presided over the magistrates’ court trial offended Mr Keedwell with the comment: “Why is my time being wasted with this ” Mr Keedwell said: “I was quietly appalled. What chance have ordinary people like me got with a legal system like that  “I was thinking already, ‘I wonder how much it will cost to go to Crown Court.’” Despite losing thousands of pounds that, Mr Keedwell said, would have been inherited by his  and -year-old children, the figure that particularly irked him was the £ victim surcharge. He said:  “That was a joke. Who was the victim ” “Theystill live at home because they cannot afford their own houses,” he added.    “The eldest is like, ‘Why do you bloody bother ’ My we has a degree of frustration. “But on the other hand, she knows it’s my money. She’s aware there is more to this than a simple speeding case. “The money would probably have gone to our sons, or some of it maybe to the donkey’s home because my we loves animals – unfortunately itaposs now in the pockets of the law.” Fortunately for his sons, they will still inherit the family home and Mr Keedwell is still comfortable. When asked where he got his spirit from, he said: God knows where it comes from.

Thandeka took to Archie immediately, and she later joked that he was going to be a ladies man. The Royal Family are known for using nicknames when speaking to each other, and there are some weird and wonderful ones they use. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a number of sweet names for their kids, including Tips for George.    The name apparently started at PG - for Prince George - and they then started comparing it to the teabags. In the end, they dropped the PG bit. William has a much fancier name for Charlotte though, and he was heard calling her Mignonette when they played in a garden Kate designed at the Cha Flower Show. The French word means small, sweet, and delicate or cute. Older French definitions also show it can mean gentle and kind. But some of the Familyaposs names arenapost quite as cute and flattering.    While the royal kids call the Queen Gan-Gan, her husband Prince Philip has a few bizarre alternatives to Elizabeth. Apparently the main nickname he uses for the love of his le is Lilibet , but he also occasionally calls her Sausage . However possibly the strangest nickname for the Queen is Gary , and sheaposs got Prince William to thank for it.

A robber punched, kicked and threw -year-old Lauren Reece Flay to the ground while she was on her way to work. The robber set upon her in the town of Hessle, in Hull, moments after she left its train station on the night of Friday, September .She was ragged around by her attacker before he made off with her phone and a small amount of cash, reports Hull Live .But Lauren, of north Hull, soon received the most devastating news from doctors when they told her she had miscarried the day after the robbery - and just days after finding out she was pregnant.    She said: “I was only literally early on pregnant. We only found out within that week. “When the ambulance first came I didn’t have any stomach pain. I just wanted to go home to my son and be in my own kind of place. “But then on the Saturday I started to have a few pains. When they told me I kind of knew straight away. “I was shocked but expected it. “It is s**t to be honest. I was excited about it. I told my sister and my friends that it was something I was really looking forward to.” The man who carried out the robbery was described as white, in his s, of slim build, wearing a black Northface jacket, grey joggers and a black baseball cap.    Lauren, who has an -month-old son, says she saw her attacker before she stepped onto the Hull to Sheffield bound train at Hull Paragon. She said: “I always get the .pm train and on this evening there was a man in his early twenties acting strange but I didn’t think too much into it. “I just thought it’s a Friday night and he might be on something and I didn’t take too much interest. “When the train was going he was walking up and down the aisle and that was when I was starting to feel a little worried. “He then sat at my table and kept staring at me. He answered his phone and was talking to a mate and it sounded like he was going to Sheffield. “As the train was stopping at Hessle I was at the door and he then got up to get off which I thought was strange as I thought he was getting off at Sheffield. “He then tried to get off the train on the other side where the tracks were, so I told him ‘youaposve got to get off this side, you don’t want to end up dead’.” As Lauren stepped off the train she began to “dawdle” her way to work, hoping that the strange man would bypass her on the bridge at the station – but he didn’t. Lauren kept walking along Southfield when she was then punched and grabbed by her alleged attacker and “ragged” around.    She said: “He never went past me so straight away I thought it was a bit strange. “I carried on walking and went to put my headphones in and then the next thing I knew he punched me in the chest and then again and then ragged me around. “He even kicked me in the legs”. Lauren suffered two fractured ribs on her left side and bruising to her chest. She had no phone so made her way to work for help before she was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. The next day, she was told she had suffered a miscarriage. Another man is said to have walked ahead of Lauren and her attacker as they got off the train who she thinks might be able to help. She said: “There was another male who was in front of us but he was walking at normal pace. “The way the man ran after the attack was in the same direction as that other man so I thought maybe he passed him.” "},{"url":null,"title":"terrifying picture shows girl 22","story":"NewsTerrying picture shows girl, , being spiked by stranger on Zante holidayGemma Reynolds friend caught someone trying to slip something into her drink while they were out partying in Zante, GreeceShareCommentsByDarragh BerryMilo Boyd:,  SEP NewsGemma was unaware someone was sneaking up behind her \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe worldaposs first aposbaby bottleapos used by our Bronze Age ancestors more than , years ago has been unveiled by scientists. The clay container was used to feed an infant fresh milk from cows, goats or sheep - up to , years ago. And it could mean that other vessels up to , years ago in Neolithic times were also used as baby bottles, though there is no definite proof for this. The Bronze Age vessel had a two inch wide bowl with an extremely narrow spout through which the liquid could be poured. It was found in a Bronze Age tomb in Baia, southern Germany - buried with the cremated remains of the one to two year old child. A chemical analysis of lipid residues found it contained traces of milk from domesticated animals. The specic species could not be identied. Two similar vessels discovered in the graves of infants at a nearby Iron Age cemetery dating back , to , years also had fatty-acids from ruminants. The discovery will prompt anthropologists to re-evaluate the way that humans have evolved over the centuries.    It had been presumed prehistoric babies were fed in their early months or years with breast milk provided by mother. The assumption ties in with the belief during the primitive hunter-gather era, mums stayed in mud huts feeding infants while dads went out into the wilderness in search of prey. These stereotypical roles were thought to have held firm until modern times when the invention of baby bottles, powdered milk and other innovations allowed women to be liberated from domestic duties. Lead author Dr Julie Dunne, of the University of Bristol, said: These very small, evocative, vessels give us valuable information on how and what babies were fed thousands of years ago, providing a real connection to mothers and infants in the past. The foods used to supplement or replace breast milk in babiesapos diets in prehistoric times had been a mystery. It is believed humans first started drinking animal milk in Europe. Earlier this year a study of dental plaque showed Stone Age cavemen consumed it , years ago. Now Dr Dunne and colleagues present the earliest known evidence of animal milk in small aposbottlesapos for babies. The study published in Nature sheds light on the infant weaning practices of prehistoric human groups. Pottery vessels with spouts through which liquid could be poured have been found dating back to Neolithic times, more than , years ago. They are usually small enough to fit within a babyaposs hands and have a spout through which liquid could be suckled.   Sometimes they have feet and are shaped like imaginary animals - such as a pig. It had been suggested they were to help feed the sick or infirm. But the three obviously specialised vessels in child graves - combined with the chemical evidence - suggests they were used to feed animal milk to babies, say the researchers. This would either be in place of human milk or during weaning onto supplementary foods. The only previous evidence for weaning came from isotopic analysis of infant skeletons. But this could only give rough guidelines of when children were weaned, not what they were eating or drinking. Dr Dunne said: This evidence of the foodstuffs that were used to either feed or wean prehistoric infants confirms the importance of milk from domesticated animals for these early communities, and provides information on the infant-feeding behaviours that were practised by prehistoric human groups.It is the first study of its kind, opening the way for investigations of feeding vessels from other ancient cultures worldwide.Dr Dunne said: Similar vessels, although rare, do appear in other prehistoric cultures - such as Rome and ancient Greece - across the world.Ideally, weaposd like to carry out a larger geographic study and investigate whether they served the same purpose. Breastfeeding is integral to infant care in all human groups and fundamental to the mother-infant relationship.  It provides an infant with the nutrients required to sustain growth for the first six months of le, protects against bugs and boosts development of the immune system. Dr Dunne said: The introduction of energy and nutrient-rich, easily digestible, supplementary foods in infant feeding - that is, during weaning - is unique to humans. Supplementary foods are generally introduced at around six months of age, when the metabolic requirements of an infant exceed the energy yield that the mother can provide through milk, contributing to the infant diet as chewing, tasting and digestive competencies develop. She pointed out animal milk contains more carbohydrates, in the form of lactose, and much less protein. Furthermore, feeding it unpasteurised comes with a risk of contamination and transmission of animal diseases, as well as bacterial contamination from the vessel. Added Dr Dunne: Notwithstanding these obvious risks, our discovery of ruminant-milk-based foods in these prehistoric baby bottles offers a rare glimpse into the ways prehistoric families were attempting to deal with the challenges of infant nutrition and weaning at this inherently risky phase of the human le cycle.

He added: “It’s about building up intelligence on where all the asbestos is.”An internal investigation was carried out into the incident at the school, and it was also reported to the Health and Safety Executive , who found that despite being warned that a damaged door contained asbestos two years ago, the authority had not replaced it.They also found that the contractor carrying out work had not been given an asbestos survey and was only told of the toxic substance during informal, undocumented meetings. The report to councillors states the door was removed from its hinges presenting a “possible risk”.HSE and the local authority made some recommendations in the wake of the incident, including making sure that any available asbestos survey is provided electronically to all relevant contractors on site.The report reveals information in the central database will now be available to design teams and building services and can be shared with contractors.The local authority is also in the process of developing a programme of site inspections, due to be in place by the end of , along with ensuring all site inspections are recorded."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 16 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLet#s face it.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main Line.\"Diesel hauled trains not in a hurry already go via Dumfries so having another ersionary alternative route would not add

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

However, the local authority has stressed it is aiming to ldquoenhance parking provision in such a way that the number of available spaces in Haddington is increased beyond current levels and that better use is made of each space.Currently, Haddington town centre is home to more than  spaces.The long-stay car park at Tesco has  spaces, which includes two disabled and car club spaces and four public electric charge spaces.On the opposite side of Court Street, the car park at East Lothian Councilrsquos headquarters, John Muir House, has  spaces.The majority of those ndash  ndash are long stay but the car park is reserved for ldquocouncil-based activities between am and pm throughout the week and is only available to the general public at the weekend and outwith those times.Proposals suggest a revamp of High Street, which has  spaces Market Street, which has  spaces Hardgate, which has four spaces and Court Street, which can accommodate  cars.Meanwhile,  town centre residents have parking permits, which enable them to park in any of the restricted -minute maximum parking areas for any duration.East Lothian Council has not revealed the number of spaces ndash or the site ndash for any proposed car park at Whittingehame Drive, although it has been suggested as having between  and  spaces.Liz McDougall, chairwoman of the Nungate Gala committee, told the Courier that the council had not been in touch about the proposals.She was concerned about the impact it could have on their gala activities.

and loneliness in the town.The project was officially launched in the summer in the community centre, with almost half of those attending signing up to volunteer.Similar projects exist in other places called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and sports clubs, emphasising community development and outreach.The project is helping tackle social isolation by encouraging GPs and other health professionals to refer those at risk of isolation to ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or all those non-medical things that might make the biggest dference to improving their health and wellbeing overall.Carol then meets the referred person to discuss their likes and dislikes, what is important to them and what the barriers are to taking part in community groups.She then puts the inidual into contact with one of her lsquocommunity connectorsrsquo related to a certain

them into it, said Carol.ldquoThe connector could give them a realistic sense of what the group is like.Connectors can also volunteer their time to accompany someone, for example, to the gym on a one-off basis.Others can meet someone over a number of occasions, providing them someone to talk to over coffee.Carol has also set up smallscale cafe meetings for those who would like to meet new people.She highlighted it was not only older people who were at risk of social isolation, referring to her own experience of losing her dad and becoming a new mother soon after.She explained how the experience left her ldquocompletely wrecked and thinking that everyone around her was coping very well.She said: ldquoThere are a lot of reasons people might feel isolated at some point.ldquoIf you have been through something that is a huge setback then your confidence is that much lower.As well as mental health, other reasons people could use Community Connections could be due to accident,

In many cases such as our sports reporter Alison McConnell they have opted to go freelance and had the financial cushion of continuing to write paid columns for us. We retain talent but on a reduced cost base.As with almost all industries, we need to continually adapt to new technology and new demands.

A letime away from the sacred art of developing film or even inserting an HD card.

Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-gardens-frontline-climate-change","story":"As rookies, my husband and I are feeling our way at this horticultural lark.

A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"chief-policing-parades-not-sustainable","story":"Iain Livingstone yesterday told his ruling watchdog too many of his officers were being dragged away from their normal duties this marching season.The chief and onehis deputies, Northern Ireland veteran Will Kerr, also railed against ldquoutterly unacceptable violence against police.Earlier this month six parades ndash Republican and Loyalist ndash were banned by Glasgow City Council amid concerns over public safety.The rare action came after clashes between rival groups on successive weekends, with officers among those injured.Police Scotland mobilised  officers from across Scotland in Glasgow for one September weekend of marches and counter-protests. That cost more than pound,.:All republican and loyalist marches this weekend banned by Glasgow City CouncilMr Livingstone told the Scottish Police Authority in Falkirk yesterday: ldquoThis has been demanding at an operational level but a strategic level as well.ldquoIs it sustainable  No, it is not. The capability of the single service comes in to bear. One of the officers injured was based in Dunfermline. We are drawing officers from right across the country away from their key role to respond to this.ldquoIn terms of sustainability, it is a signicant challenge. In terms of officer safety, there is a growing trend of attacks. There has been a signicant increase in the west of Scotland in particular. They are up by more than a fth.ldquoThe recent manestation of these marches, walks and protests seems to me to be part of a growing trend where our officers are coming under attack and it is utterly unacceptable. It is not part of the job.Referring to the last weekend in August and the first in September, Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said: ldquoThose are officers who are not involved in investigating ndash as we want them to be ndash domestic abuse incidents across the city and tackling drug and traffic offences, and dealing with normal police business.BACKGROUND:Political polarisation fears over Glasgows  Orange marchesSpeaking of the first weekend in September, he said: ldquoSo there are a whole range of opportunity costs which are attendant and added on top of that pound, pure cost of the operation itself.ldquoThat being said, the chief has made it clear that to protect the city of Glasgow and its citizens we will deploy as many police officers as we need to do to make sure the city is both safe and feels safe.ldquoWe have set up an investigation team led by a detective inspector ndashover  detectives are involved in that ndash who are robustly investigating all the offences involved.ldquoWe have made  arrests so far. There will be more arrests over the coming weeks and months.ldquoWe will not accept that sort of behaviour. We certainly wonrsquot accept assaults on our police officers.ldquoOne of those arrests has been for the throwing of the pyrotechnic and one of our officers being injured by that.Police have also been hurt at football matches, including at Rangers Europa League home game against Feyenoord of the Netherlands.Mr Kerr listed problems: ldquoWe had six officers injured before and during that match. Throwing coins at officers. hitting them in the head and legs. Spitting on officers faces, kicking at their legs, throwing stones, one of which hit an officers in the face, punching officers to the face.ldquoThat is just wholly unacceptable. It cannot be right in  that we have officers deployed to protect their communities subject to that level of violence both at parades and associated protests or at football matches.Mr Kerr urged a sense of perspective. Citing his  years in Belfast policing, he stressed that only a tiny minority were involved in trouble. But he added: ldquoWe do need to have a clear, hard look at ourselves as to whether that is acceptable. We should not be putting officers in that position in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"papers-digital-journalism-contributing-bottom-line-herald-ever","story":"But that was the position I found myself in on day one when I started as Digital Editor at The Herald in November .

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A body recovered near Boddam is believed to be that of Ruairidh Sandison\"  A body recovered from the coast near Boddam is thought to be that of missing man Ruairidh Sandison. viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We should not underestimate our achievements to date in tackling climate change – we have already almost halved emissions since . “We cannot, however, be complacent.

They are then being asked to report where and when they saw them on the Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels websitescottishsquirrels.org.uk.Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels is a partnership project led by the Scottish Wildle Trust that is working to protect red squirrels where they are most under threat from the spread of non-native grey squirrels. Squirrel sightings received from the public help the project understand how red and grey squirrel populations are changing over time and decide where to focus conservation efforts.Prject manager Dr Mel Tonkin said: “We monitor squirrel populations throughout the year, and in  we received an incredible  squirrel sightings from members of the public.“This year, thanks to support from National Lottery players, we’re trying something a bit dferent.“By going out and looking for squirrels during the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey people can help us create a more detailed snapshot of the current situation on the ground.”Autumn is an ideal time of year for squirrel-watching. With leaves falling they can be easier to spot as they move through the treetops, foraging for the autumn harvest of seeds, nuts and berries. They will also be spending more time on the ground, building up stores of food in preparation for the colder months ahead.Mel added: “During the survey week you could visit a well-known squirrel stomping ground to help us keep our records up-to-date. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jon Marshall, Zero Waste Scotlands recycling sector manager, and chief executive Iain Gulland want recycled food waste to be used to power vehicles, just like the DeLorean car in the movie Back to the Future. \"  \"  Food waste really can power cars like in the s’ Back to the Future movies viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“Or,you’re feeling adventurous, you could visit a woodland where few sightings have been recorded before. “The more information we receive from the public, the better our understanding of Scotland’s squirrel populations will be.” Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmaker and Scottish Wildle Trust ambassador, said: “The red squirrel is an iconic Scottish species. “Thanks to conservation efforts their populations are beginning to stabilise, but their future is still under threat. “Taking part in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey is a really simple way you can help.”The results of the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey will be published later this year.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The fact we donrsquot have Wi-Fi or reliable signal at our Shepherdrsquos Hut BB is a big selling point. ldquoSouth Ayrshire Council has just published a consultation document on planning policy for the area, she explained.ldquoWe have responded, asking that they consider introducing policy to create or protect a black spot on the land owned by Creeside Farm.ldquoThis high level of protection doesnrsquot currently exist anywhere in the UK so what we are proposing is unique.ldquoWersquore not looking to hold up improvements in connectivity across the region especially in communities where signal is poor.She added: ldquoWhat we are proposing would look to develop a level of protection around the land owned by the farm, which would therefore stop masts being allowed to be put up within a certain proximity.ldquoItrsquos about restricting networks on a small area, and wouldnrsquot impact the ability to make emergency calls, nor stop connectivity being improved from the surrounding area.The bid, in partnership with Shackleton Whisky,comes as new research for the whisky firm found that more than halfof , UK mobile phone users questioned found it impossible to switch off from technology.Ed Forrest, co-ordinater of the Galloway and Southern Ayrshire Unesco Biosphere, said: ldquoUnesco biospheres are all about connecting people with nature and we are fortunate in Galloway and Southern Ayrshire to have a Wild Place where you can really get away from it all.ldquoSo, whilst this is an unusual proposal and we would have questions around its practicality for some of our rural communities and businesses, we do recognise thatthere arehuge benefits to switching off and being at one with nature.The off-grid map, developed by Shackleton Whisky, featuressome of the remotest places in Scotland, as well as caves in the Lake District, and headland hikes in Cornwall.Map locations were selected because they receive poor or no G, G or G signal within the surrounding area.The top  included Glencoe Valley and Galloway Forest Park in Scotland,Cathedral Cave in the Lake District,Plover Hill in the Yorkshire Dales andLady Clough Forest in Derbyshire.The map can be viewed at https:offgrid.theshackletonwhisky.copy -.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment there is no travel insurance for the thomas cook employees","story":"Within hours of the Thomas Cook collapse, accusations were surfacing about rival holiday firms cashing in by hiking their prices. Meanwhile, the UK’s largest peacetime repatriation swung into action as the Civil Aviation Authority worked out how to bring , stranded tourists back home. Families turned up at airports not knowingthey were going to get to go on holidays, other stories surfaced about honeymoons and weddings thrown into chaos. It is, however you look at it, an appalling situation, and our sympathies are with everyone affected. Amid all the rolling coverage yesterday, however, one element appeared all but overlooked. The fact that , people, , of whom are in the UK have not lost their holidays with Thomas Cook’s failure but their livelihoods. While the £ million Operation Matterhorn is bringing tourists home, another looming challenge for the governments in both London and Edinburgh will be the thousands now out of work. The arguments over whether the UK Government was right to refuse a bail-out to the stricken travel giant will continue. There are questions around what it knew when and whether it could have stepped in sooner to prevent catastrophe. There is further anger over the lack of scrutiny of its actions caused by the proroguing of parliament. But none of that changes the simple fact that a -year-old business, a mainstay of the British high street for so long, has disappeared forever. Once the immediate challenge of repatriation is complete, efforts have to turn to supporting the Thomas Cook employees into alternative employment as quickly as possible. It is reassuring to see the Scottish Government has already made an offer of support through its Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentinitiative, and the support available on a UK-wide scale should be far greater.The thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos can retain some comfort that their holidays were protected by law and they will be refunded, albeit they may face a long wait. Others waiting to fly home, can be reassured that the Government will arrange alternative flights for them.The thousands out of work as a result of Thomas Cook’s demise have no such reassurance today. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"richard madden jack lowden kelly macdonald and jenna coleman in running for bafta scotland honours","story":"Child abduction mystery The Cry, which Doctor Who favourite Coleman starred in and was partly filmed in Glasgow, leads the honours race along with Wild Rose, the Glasgow-set hit about a young country singer, played by Irish actress Jessie Buckley, trying to make it to Nashville after getting out of jail.The BAFTA Scotland ceremony, which will be hosted by broadcaster Edith Bowman in Glasgow on  November, will be shown on BBC Scotlandrsquos channel, its first TV coverage in more than a decade.Organisers revealed they had seen an almost of almost  per cent in entries in the space of  months and also hailed the ersity of the shortlists, following criticism in previous years about the number of women nominated for major honours.

Women are much more prevalent in the big categories now. To have three writers nominated this year is amazing.\"Now, more than ever, is the time for women to just go for it. There are more opportunities than there ever has been. To see that reflected in the nominees for the awards is just brilliant.\"Jude MacLaverty, director of BAFTA Scotland, said: \"It is very exciting that three women are shortlisted in the writer category this year.\"Female writers tend to write what they know and it generally follows through that there are strong female characters in those pieces.\"And from what I can gauge. the industry is crying out for more female-led stories.\"We had almost  per cent more entries this year, which was unprecedented. That wasnt just about the content that is being made for the new BBC Scotland channel, it was also about an increase in feature films and documentaries.

Well done to all those who bothered to go out to make their feelings known, rather than sitting at home making supercilious comments online.Surely all Shetlanders are either incomers or the descendants of incomers John Ridland presumably wants to see some form of Apartheid with multigenerational residents receiving greater recognition and status.This rednecked social exclusionary nonsense just gets so tired. It might helpit can be appreciated that there are dferent types of Shetlanders, with all Shetlanders being equally valid.Maybe Shetlander is a state of mind, of wanting to care for, share in and build the community for the greater good, doing weel for the common weel and persevering.I sincerely hope John Ridland’s atypical attitude will one day be consigned to the dustbin of history.It should be challenged wherever it raises its ugly head.So far as he knows John did nothing worthy in a past le to be born in Shetland.He could equally have been born where.It’s the lottery of birth that entitles him to don that mantle and there is no need for him to be making others who also care for where they live feel unwelcome.Can he not see this inward and backwards looking approach is harming his community, not strengthening or celebrating it Shameful. #xenophobiasucks#getoveritYes Peter totally agree.Becauseyou went to live with the Pigmy people of equitorial Africa for several months you would be just as big a Pigmy as they are.That is because they #are just incomers or the descendants of incomers#.There is obviously no dference.The IPCC calls for collective international action and condemns unilateral actions e.g. #declaration of climate emergency#, as ineffective.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September. Acts on the bill include Niteworks, Elephant Sessions, Lau, Tide Lines and Peat and Diesel as well as DJs Erol Alkan, Optimoand Leon Vynehall.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/barra-hospital.jpg","title":"consultation events for barra","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineComhairle nan Eilean Siar are to visit Barra next weekfor two consultation events that will help inform a feasibility study into thecreation of a combined school and hospital facility in Castlebay.The proposal caused confusion and anger earlier thisyear, when it was first publicised, as both the comhairle and NHS Western Isleshad already progressed a plan for a new hospital to replace St Brendan’s.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"28k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"all northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes to be withdrawn from circulation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I don’t remember what the border looked like in the past and I feel very, very lucky as many other young people who live on the border do now,” she said.Ms Finn shared an anecdote about a young girl she met recently who lives on the border: “This girl lives in the north of Ireland, and her granny lives in the south. The way to get to her grandmother’s house is on a road where there has been a hard border.“At  years of age, she came and asked me – ‘Will I still be able to see my grandmother,there’s no deal Brexit  I think that is one story for people to listen to and it has to be seen as a terrying example of how Brexit is affecting young people within Northern Ireland.”Ms Finn said the young people living in Northern Ireland fear what rights they will lose when Britain leaves the EU.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Doire Finn, Co-founder of Our Future, Our Choice NI “They haven’t lived in the shadow of violence that so many other people have and they believe in the freedom to live, love and work across the European Union.

It is about young people whose lives are going to be impacted by this, and they should be heard and they should be listened to.“I would like everybody to remember that my generation are the children of the peace process.

the second major firm to face collapse within a week after holiday company Thomas Cook entered liquidation.The Unite union warned of “devastating consequences” for the workforce at the firm, which manufactured the so-called “Boris bus” ordered by Mr Johnson when he was London mayor but has struggled with cash flow problems.Angry workers described “silence” in the room as they were told the news during mass meetings in Northern Ireland on Wednesday morning.Stephen Wright, , a production manager from Ballymena, said it was a sombre atmosphere as more than , direct and indirect jobs were put at risk.“It is a very close-knit company and a lot of people were there a long time.“A lot of good friendships and relationships are coming to an end, so it is a sad day.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Staff members shake hands as they leave the Wrightbus plant in Ballymena Norman Stephens, a paint shop quality inspector, has worked for Wrightbus for  years.He said he felt sorry for company founder Sir William Wright, who had worked so hard to build up what was once one of Northern Ireland’s most successful companies.Mr Stephens said: “He built it from nothing with his father and now it has went to the dogs.”He said administration was on the cards five years ago.“Who is going to employ a -year-old man “I have nothing now, that is it.”Unite regional secretary Jackie Pollock said it was a workforce at the cutting edge of technological advancements in the design and supply of green public transport.He added: “We cannot afford to lose any more jobs or skills in this area.“Just three months ago, Boris Johnson gave assurances that he ‘will do everything we can to ensure the future of that great UK company’.“He has a chance today to do something decent.”Administrators Michael Magnay and Peter Allen, from Deloitte, said the ious Wrightbus companies had around , employees and the lack of a buyer “unfortunately means approximately , redundancies are being made today”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Metal cases for tools are wheeled from the Wrightbus plant in Ballymena Mr Magnay said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern.“We recognise the companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years.“We will continue to support employees through this dficult time.“The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.”DUP MP Ian Paisley said the administrator “has a week to find a buyer”.The North Antrim firm has been seeking investment or a new owner as it struggles with cash problems.Stormont Assembly member Jim Allister said: “My heart goes out to the hundreds with no wage packet this week or job hereafter.”Wrightbus has been a hugely profitable company in the past and based its business model on producing low-emissions vehicles.When Mr Johnson was mayor he announced a lucrative order to produce London’s distinctive red double-decker, an updated version of the original Routemaster.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A Routemaster bus passes through Piccadilly Circus, London Critics at the time said the new “Boris buses” were too expensive and estimated that the first eight had cost £. million each to design and build.There were also complaints that the new Routemasters, which were longer and heavier than other models, were unbearably hot, with later batches altered to provide windows.Mr Johnson visited Wrightbus during the EU referendum campaign in February .Wrightbus founder Mr Wright has been a prominent supporter of Brexit and the DUP, which has been propping up the Tories at Westminster.Northern Ireland’s manufacturing industry has been under pressure in recent years, with the slumping into administration of Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.Michelin Tyres

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

new regional and isional headquarters..pushThe locations are part of a restructuring programme under the new Garda Operating Model.The regions will reduce from six to four and the Garda isions from  to .Commissioner Drew Harris, who has been tasked with overhauling the previously much maligned force, said the reduced number of isions will give superintendents more autonomy and free up more frontline police officers.The Policing Authority, which backed the move, labelled the change the biggest restructuring in the history of the Garda.The force said a wide range of operational factors were considered when deciding where the new regional and isional headquarters should be based.Our new operating model will enhance the investigation of crime through a greater range of specialised services in local areas, such as the investigation of sexual crime, domestic violence, cyber crime and economic crimeCommissioner Drew HarrisThese factors included: population, geography, projected growth, crime trends and workload across a range of work streams.The isional headquarters will be based in Galway, Castlebar, Letterkenny, Drogheda, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Wexford, Waterford, Anglesea St , Macroom, Tralee, Henry Stand Ennis.Losing their isional HQ status are Monaghan, Roscommon, and Sligo towns respectively, as well as Bray, Fermoy, Kilkenny, Naas, Navan and Thurles.There have been concerns raised by the public and politicians that the reduction of isions, and centralising the local force, could lead to longer response times and reduced police presence, due to larger distances from HQs to certain areas now within their remit.For instance, Kildare, despite being the most densely populated county in its newly formed Garda ision, will not host the isional headquarters, which has been designated to Portlaoise.The new North Western region will be headquartered in Murrough, Co Galway, the Eastern region headquarters will be located in Co Kilkenny, and the Southern region will be headed up from Anglesea, Cork city.The Dublin politan Region will remain unchanged, with regional headquarters based in Harcourt Square in the city.Divisions and headquarters throughout the Dublin region are: Ballymun, Crumlin, Store Street, Kevin Street, Dun Laoghaire, and Blanchardstown.The new operating model has already commenced with the amalgamation of regions and will be introduced into isions on a phased basis.Divisions in the border region are unlikely to see any signicant change until further clarity is available on Brexit.Mr Harris has previously told the Justice Committee: “There’s enough happening in the border isions at the moment without telling them on November , ‘Guess what  You’re also doing structural change’.“We’ll hold off until we get some certainty on what the Brexit position is likely to be.”After the announcement on Wednesday, Commissioner Harris said the change will see larger isions with more resources.“It will deliver increased Garda visibility in communities, as well as more localised services,” he said.“Resources will be strongly focused on community policing, chief superintendents and superintendents will be empowered to make decisions on how policing is best delivered within their isions while working to a corporate framework.“Superintendents will be located throughout the isions and will be supported by additional sergeants and inspectors.“In addition, our new operating model will enhance the investigation of crime through a greater range of specialised services in local areas, such as the investigation of sexual crime, domestic violence, cyber crime and economic crime.“Each ision will be provided with a detective superintendent who along with trained investigators in specialist areas will be responsible for local crime investigation.“Complex or highly technical crimes will generally be dealt with at national level.”"},{"url":null,"title":"farmers bid to have land designated official

The fact we don’t have Wi-Fi or reliable signal at our Shepherd’s Hut BB is a big selling point.”What we are proposing would look to develop a level of protection around the land owned by the farm, which would therefore stop masts being allowed to be put up within a certain proximitySarah Redman“South Ayrshire Council has just published a consultation document on planning policy for the area,” she explained.“We have responded, asking that they consider introducing policy to create or protect a black spot on the land owned by Creeside Farm.“This high level of protection doesn’t currently exist anywhere in the UK so what we are proposing is unique.“We’re not looking to hold up improvements in connectivity across the region especially in communities where signal is poor.”She added: “What we are proposing would look to develop a level of protection around the land owned by the farm, which would therefore stop masts being allowed to be put up within a certain proximity.“It’s about restricting networks on a small area, and wouldn’t impact the ability to make emergency calls, nor stop connectivity being improved from the surrounding area.”The bid, in partnership with Shackleton Whisky, comes as new research for the whisky firm found that more than halfof , UK mobile phone users questioned found it impossible to switch off from technology.Ed Forrest, co-ordinater of the Galloway and Southern Ayrshire Unesco Biosphere, said: “Unesco biospheres are all about connecting people with nature and we are fortunate in Galloway and Southern Ayrshire to have a Wild Place where you can really get away from it all.“So, whilst this is an unusual proposal and we would have questions around its practicality for some of our rural communities and businesses, we do recognise that there are huge benefits to switching off and being at one with nature.”The off-grid map, developed by Shackleton Whisky, features some of the remotest places in Scotland, as well as caves in the Lake District, and headland hikes in Cornwall.Map locations were selected because they receive poor or no G, G or G signal within the surrounding area.The top  included Glencoe Valley and Galloway Forest Park in Scotland, Cathedral Cave in the Lake District, Plover Hill in the Yorkshire Dales and Lady Clough Forest in Derbyshire.The map can be viewed at https:offgrid.theshackletonwhisky."},{"url":null,"title":"gamers jump into new mario kart tour smartphone game","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly voted on Wednesday to legalise possession by adults of up to  gramsof dried marijuana and cultivation of two marijuana plants beginning on January .The assembly is the local government of Canberra, the national capital with a population of ,.The law requires that adults not use marijuana near children and to store it out of their reach.Owners

Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer and Take ControlHouseholds are limited to growing no more than four plants, regardless of the number of occupants.Attorney General Gordon Ramsay said it was time to treat drug addiction as a health issue rather than an issue of “right and wrong”.The opposition voted against the legislation, arguing that the change would encourage more people to use marijuana and lead to more drug-induced psychosis.Possession of small amounts of marijuana has been decriminalised throughout Australia, but the Australian Capital Territory is the first of Australia’s eight states and territories to take the next step of legalising possession and cultivation.But marijuana users in Canberra will still face some legal uncertainty because possession of small amounts of marijuana remains illegal under federal law.Chief Minister Andrew Barr said such prosecutions would require approval of federal prosecutors, who are “concerned with larger matters than the possession of a small amount of drug”.Federal prosecutors have declined to provide the government with advice on the likelihood of such prosecutions.Mr Barr said police charging Canberra marijuana smokers under federal law “would be outrageous”, but the smokers could cite the territory law in their defence before a judge.Australian Federal Police Chief Police Officer Ray Johnson said Canberra police had been advised to “focus on the traffickers”, but that officers were free to enforce federal law.Former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer issued a joint statement with the Take Control drug law reform campaign congratulating the territory on the change.“I welcome what I consider to be a courageous decision by the ACT parliament to put control into a completely uncontrolled environment,” the statement said.Medical marijuana has been available in Australia to patients with doctors’ prescriptions since .The Australian Capital Territory is renowned for its liberal policies toward illicit drugs.In April, Canberra hosted Australia’s first pill-testing facility at a music festival so that drug users could have their illicit substances analysed for

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"door now wide open independent nw university derry university group","story":"A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has responded to the report on higher education published by Julian Smith.We welcome the clarity provided by this report and intend to respond in full in due course.At the outset, we wish to thank Lord Andrew Adonis, the Shadow Employment Minister Mike Amesbury MP and the Shadow Schools Minister Mike Kane MP for championing this issue at Westminster, and also the authors of this report.The Shadow Education Minister Angela Rayner has also raised the prospect of Derry availing of Transformation Fundingand we thank her for that proposal.On initial reading, this report provides a roadmap as to how the North West can develop its own autonomous university.

Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining. Amongst its lyrics: \"Whats more precious than gold \"The land, the sea, the air that we breathe, thats more precious than gold.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor renews call back supporting people programme frontline workers","story":"The Mayor of Derry and Strabane has stressed the need for employers to “review their practices” and value the workers who are supporting some of the most vulnerable people in society.Supporting People Programme workers provide housing related support services, help people affected by domestic violence, those with addictions, families with child protection concerns, people in need of benefit advice and more.Earlier this year the local council unanimously backed a motion which recognised the work of frontline workers and called for an independent review into the programme, including terms and conditions of its workers.In a statement to the Derry News this week, Mayor, Michaela Boyle of Sinn Féin, reiterated the need to back workers: \"As Mayor I would like to voice my support for those involved in the Supporting People Programme, and stress the need to protect and respect the rights of frontline workers.\"This is an issue that affects so many people in the Derry and Strabane area who are dealing daily with the challenges of providing a valuable support service helping some of the most vulnerable people in our society.\"This matter needs to be urgently addressed and I would encourage those employers involved to review their practices and fully acknowledge the value of the staff delivering these much needed specialist services.\"Niall McCarroll, UNISON community branch chairperson said the Supporting People Campaign presented \"damning evidence\" to Derry City and Strabane District Councils Health and Community Committee.It detailed the outworkings of outsourced public contracts and the growing crisis within the Department for Communities and NIHE funded Supporting People Programme - \"a crisis which is impeding service delivery for vulnerable people and denying frontline workers the right to social justice.\"With specic reference to supported living workplaces, he said, the reality of outsourcing within the community sector is that some employers, unchallenged, choose not to value their frontline workers whilst garnishing a select few, who they deem worthy.\"The transfer of public services has many beneficiaries, however working class people are not included but rather excluded from benefiting from an honest days work.\"UNISON Community Branch activists are working hard and are committed to building a community wide culture of solidarity with regards the Supporting People Campaign and now with the direct involvement and support of the Mayor this solidarity focused campaign has become more dynamic and influential.\"The UNISON led Save the Foyle Haven Campaign began with the workers getting organised, the wider community mobilising in support and finally DCSDC joined the campaign through the office of the Mayor and collectively the workers driven movement protected jobs and a much valued and needed service.\"He continued: \"These are the fundamentals of any trade union movement campaigning formula, a blueprint for equality, integrity and the downfall of self serving governance.\"On behalf of our branch membership a UNISON delegation will now meet with the Mayor to deliver a list of human rights based questions, for both employers and all relevant statutory bodies to provide answers.\"The employers and statutory agencies will now be called in front of the DCSDC Health and Community Committee to engage in the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign as we focus on protecting the Supporting People programme and safeguarding frontline workers against corporate greed and those not fit for purpose employers who operate within this sector.\"The right of everyone to the enjoyment of just and favourable conditions of work is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, its time this same right was honoured and upheld within the Supporting People programme.\"UNISON would like to thank the DCSDC Health and Community Committee for the genuine support offered following the UNISON presentation to council and we look forward to working closely with them in the future.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"montgomery couple aiming high

Shea Croskery raced through moments later and drove for goal, but saw his effort go wide and Dundrumrsquos relief was palpable.Instead of going eight points behind, Dundrum did well to re-group and points from Aidan Fegan and a second Venney free cut the deficit back to three points.Oran Flanagan sent over the next three points in the second quarter of the game with Glavin doing the same for Dundrum. Garland and Croskery also raised the white flag with their strikes to leave the lsquoFin with a half-time lead of - to -.Fegan got the first point of the second half for Dundrum with three minutes gone and a third free kick of the game was landed by Venney by the end of the third quarter.While the lsquoFin had not yet scored, it wasnrsquot for the want of trying as a few opportunities were missed and Dundrum lsquokeeper Eamon King pulled off a superb double save, the first from Croskery and the follow up from Chris Doran.Oran Flanagan was having a good game and he sent over his fourth point of the match and a superb effort from Shane McCann restored the lsquoFinrsquos four point half-time advantage with ten minutes remaining.Dundrum continued to threaten, but other than two more excellent points from their standout player Kyle Glavin, the lsquoFin defence held strong and kept the dangerous duo of Venney and Fegan scoreless the remainder of the game.Dundrum half forward Fegan was sent to the line after getting a second yellow in the final throes of the game.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since . On Monday he was clearly angry that time was running out.POLITICS mdash A suggestion that South Down MP, Enoch Powell, should accompany a Down council deputation to Stormont was kicked out by SDLP councillors this week.The suggestion was surprisingly made by industry minister, Mr Giles Shaw, who has agreed to meet a council deputation to discuss industrial affairs in Down district.In a letter to councillors, Mr Shaw suggested that Mr Powell should be advised of the meeting and,convenient, should accompany the council delegation.SDLP councillor, Mr Eddie McGrady, described the ministerrsquos decision as ldquoodd and said he had never come across anything like it before in his  years in government affairs.He thought the minister was ldquousurping the councilrsquos decision to form its own deputation and he believed the motive behind the suggestion was not altogether altruistic.He told councillors: ldquoWhat is happening is that a new precedent is being proposed to us. A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

So, do I belong to the IRA  I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, based on his own words in a BBC Spotlight film to be broadcast tonight, those denials were lies.Ryan, who is almost , was the critical link between Libya and the IRA as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi happily supplied guns and explosives to republicans so that they could attack their common enemy, the British.Speaking in the third instalment of Spotlight’s seven-part series on the Troubles, Ryan is explicit about his own role in illegal activities.Spotlight did not state whether Ryan still lives in Ireland nor did it explain why he has now decided to self-incriminate himself as has done.During the interview with the BBC, Ryan praised the Libyan dictator who was killed in an uprising in . He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.No Deal Brexit: As many , people in Republic of Ireland with U.K. driving licence could be driving illegally Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was. But we didn’t do too badly, no.”l Spotlight on The Troubles: A Secret History will be broadcast tonight on BBC One Northern Ireland and also simultaneously on BBC Four at pm.try catch  TrendingN.I.

The group’s initial financial backers include the Irish government, along with Belfast Harbour, NICVA, The Community Foundation, The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, Queen’s University and Ulster University.Ms Watt declined to say how much money had come from the Irish government and accepted that it might seem imbalanced that only the Irish government – rather than also the British government – is a financial backer. However, she said that there had been “lots of positive support from the civil service”.The body hopes to employ four staff and has funding for its first two years. The organisation is presenting itself as agnostic on the constitutional question and has involved many iniduals from across the political spectrum.Richard Good, a former special advisor to Alliance justice minister David Ford, is one of the trustees.Former Sinn Fein special advisor Leo Green, former DUP junior minister Alastair Ross, former PUP leader Dawn Purvis, former Ulster Unionist and NI Conservative Trevor Ringland and former UUP and NI MLA John McCallister are all members of the think tank’s reference group.Ms Watt accepted that without a clear ideology – even in left right terms – there was a risk that the body could suffer from the dficulties which plagued Stormont, where a broad tent encompassing contradictory political views led to inertia. However, she added: “We intend to be quite bold in saying what we think needs to be said evencertain people in the reference group disagree with it.”She said Pivotal would “work really hard to be independent, robust and balanced” and to facilitate discussion among those of dferent views. Pivotal’s first publication next month will examine economic and social priorities and it intends to start work on a vision of what Northern Ireland should look like in .\"  \"  This Wrightbus worker

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The fact we donrsquot have Wi-Fi or reliable signal at our Shepherdrsquos Hut BB is a big selling point. ldquoSouth Ayrshire Council has just published a consultation document on planning policy for the area, she explained.ldquoWe have responded, asking that they consider introducing policy to create or protect a black spot on the land owned by Creeside Farm.ldquoThis high level of protection doesnrsquot currently exist anywhere in the UK so what we are proposing is unique.ldquoWersquore not looking to hold up improvements in connectivity across the region especially in communities where signal is poor.She added: ldquoWhat we are proposing would look to develop a level of protection around the land owned by the farm, which would therefore stop masts being allowed to be put up within a certain proximity.ldquoItrsquos about restricting networks on a small area, and wouldnrsquot impact the ability to make emergency calls, nor stop connectivity being improved from the surrounding area.The bid, in partnership with Shackleton Whisky,comes as new research for the whisky firm found that more than halfof , UK mobile phone users questioned found it impossible to switch off from technology.Ed Forrest, co-ordinater of the Galloway and Southern Ayrshire Unesco Biosphere, said: ldquoUnesco biospheres are all about connecting people with nature and we are fortunate in Galloway and Southern Ayrshire to have a Wild Place where you can really get away from it all.ldquoSo, whilst this is an unusual proposal and we would have questions around its practicality for some of our rural communities and businesses, we do recognise thatthere arehuge benefits to switching off and being at one with nature.The off-grid map, developed by Shackleton Whisky, featuressome of the remotest places in Scotland, as well as caves in the Lake District, and headland hikes in Cornwall.Map locations were selected because they receive poor or no G, G or G signal within the surrounding area.The top  included Glencoe Valley and Galloway Forest Park in Scotland,Cathedral Cave in the Lake District,Plover Hill in the Yorkshire Dales andLady Clough Forest in Derbyshire.The map can be viewed at https:offgrid.theshackletonwhisky..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Farmer us bid to have land designated official offline black spot article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This rushed legislation was nailed on to a wider piece of legislation at Westminster and was passed despite the opposition of my DUP MP colleagues and with no form of public consultation whatsoever.“Our motion called for a meaningful letter to be sent on behalf of our Borough to reflect the very genuine and signicant concerns that exist around this issue.” Cllr. Greenfield who seconded the motion said this legislation is ‘a step too far’. “As demonstrated in recent times thousands of people share the view that Westminster should retract this drastic legislation at the earliest opportunity, given its serious ramications and the manner in which it has been brought..”SDLP Cllr Joe Nelson said it was an emotional debate as there are very strong views on both sides of the issue. “The SDLP remains a pro-le party but has in recent times allowed members to have a conscience vote. This is a move I did not support as I feel we have to be absolutely clear about our position. Speaking in support of the motion, after Sinn Fein had tried to get the debate stopped on a point of order, I gave my personal views as a practicing Catholic on the sanctity of le, We must consider that at around  weeks the child has a heartbeat and that modern D scans show that at   weeks the features have formed. “We agree that there is more support required for women who are suffering crisis pregnancies and more should be done. All members of the SDLP on ABC council voted in favour of the motion giving the clear signal that the SDLP group in ABC Council is very clearly Pro-Le.”Alliance Cllr Eoin Tennyson said the issue was ‘not black and white’. “Abortion is a conscience issue for Alliance. Personally, I would like to see decriminalisation, with access to free, safe and legal termination within strict gestational limits. I believe the best place for it to be considered is in the Assembly. However, the irony of the DUP’s motion is that they are one of the main stumbling blocks to that happening.”Sinn Fein declined to comment. and Liam Shannon pictured outside Belfast court with some of their legal team.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con1.jpg","title":"us cyber security firm creating  jobs in belfast","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Alastair Hamilton and Alan Naumann A US cyber-security firm is creating  jobs with a new base in Belfast.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
