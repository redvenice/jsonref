Keeley\u0027s Pet Service explained that when temperatures reach 30C, pavements can be 57CThis comes after the Met Office urged the public to stay out of the sunshine as the nation is set to bask in temperatures of up to 38C.Jason Spencer: Georgia lawmaker revealed after appearance on Sacha Baron Cohen\u0027s Who is America?Thierry Henry\u0026#8217s net worth revealed after Arsenal legend \u0026#8216agrees\u0026#8217 to take Aston Villa manager jobWhat will happen when Prince Philip dies?Who is Joshua Kushner?

Regulation 7 deals specifically with the temperature in indoor workplaces and states that: ‘During working hours, the temperature in all workplaces inside buildings shall be reasonable.‘However, the application of the regulation depends on the nature of the workplace, such as a bakery, a cold store, an office, a warehouse.’In addition, the HSE also requires that employers must keep temperatures at comfortable levels for employees and provide ‘clean, fresh air’ for them.How hot does it have to be to go home?Though no official, universal heat limits currently exist, both employees and employers must gauge when action should be taken to prevent serious health risks.‘If a significant number of employees are complaining about thermal discomfort, your employer should carry out a risk assessment, and act on the results of that assessment,’ the HSE states.Employees with preexisting medical conditions should also take extra caution in the workplace during heatwaves.In sum, although no universal heat regulations are currently in place in the UK, employees who feel uncomfortable should speak up and tell their managers.

Yesterday he did so. Last afternoon of term. Convenient.Physically, Mr Robbins is a commanding presence: tall, bull-necked, strong hair, wide shoulders. He wore a smart suit, his black shoes dazzlingly polished. He sat alongside Dominic Raab, new Brexit Secretary (predecessor David Davis having quit at Mr Robbins’s interferences).Anyone judging Raab and Robbins simply on looks might have presumed that the latter was the politician, for he bore himself with the greater pomp. Mr Raab? A foot shorter, with the darting, stressy look of a clerk. More than half of Americans think Russia has \u0027kompromat\u0027 on...Tanks for the memory! Artillery booms and diesel fumes as...Share this articleA vein throbs on the right of his brow and he is prone to flushing in the face.When they spoke, the balance changed. Raab was husky, lawyerly enough to see off nitpickers (eg. matinee favourite Joanna Cherry of the SNP), at other moments quite impressively brusque with low-grade pointscorers (eg. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock). By contrast Mr Robbins’s voice was as soft as margarine. He was deferential. He bit on the lower lip, did lots of nodding and flashed a pair of dimples, working rising inflections into his tone. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his stand-in Sir Mark Sedwill, along with civil service chief executive John Manzoni, speak in almost an identical way.John Whittingdale (Con, Maldon) claimed that ‘most ministers knew nothing’ of the soft-Brexit plan pulled out of the Chequers hat.Mr Robbins, meekly: ‘I don’t think so.’ He claimed Mrs May’s ‘engagement with colleagues was constant’. Constant but deceptive, perhaps.Mr Whittingdale said it looked as if Mrs May had tried to ‘circumvent’ her Cabinet. Mr Robbins, who began most of his answers with ‘so’, said ‘it’s certainly not a picture I or the Prime Minister would recognise’.    Theresa May’s head of the Europe unit at number 10 Downing Street Olly Robbins was undergoing a spot of parliamentary scrutiny today. He has been given powers that arguably usurp those of HM Secretary of State for Brexit, Dominic RaabMr Robbins’s enhanced powers were confirmed in a parliamentary written answer published a few minutes before yesterday’s committee hearing.It confirmed a ‘change of government machinery’ which all but emasculates the Brexit department.Craig Mackinlay (Con, S Thanet) said: ‘I feel a coup d’etat has been going on.’ Mr Robbins: ‘So, Mr Mackinlay, I honestly don’t recognise the picture.’Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con, NE Somerset) wondered when Mr Robbins had started writing his Chequers papers. ‘These papers had their origins in other papers,’ said Mr Robbins. See how sneaky they are at this sort of thing? He finally conceded that the first versions of the Chequers papers were written ‘about a fortnight’ earlier.Mr Rees-Mogg, with deadly politeness, said he did not hold Mr Robbins responsible for a ‘worrying’ breakdown in Cabinet government. Mr Robbins thanked him.

Yesterday he did so. Last afternoon of term. Convenient.Physically, Mr Robbins is a commanding presence: tall, bull-necked, strong hair, wide shoulders. He wore a smart suit, his black shoes dazzlingly polished. He sat alongside Dominic Raab, new Brexit Secretary (predecessor David Davis having quit at Mr Robbins’s interferences).Anyone judging Raab and Robbins simply on looks might have presumed that the latter was the politician, for he bore himself with the greater pomp.

Raab was husky, lawyerly enough to see off nitpickers (eg. matinee favourite Joanna Cherry of the SNP), at other moments quite impressively brusque with low-grade pointscorers (eg. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock). By contrast Mr Robbins’s voice was as soft as margarine. He was deferential. He bit on the lower lip, did lots of nodding and flashed a pair of dimples, working rising inflections into his tone. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his stand-in Sir Mark Sedwill, along with civil service chief executive John Manzoni, speak in almost an identical way.John Whittingdale (Con, Maldon) claimed that ‘most ministers knew nothing’ of the soft-Brexit plan pulled out of the Chequers hat.Mr Robbins, meekly: ‘I don’t think so.’ He claimed Mrs May’s ‘engagement with colleagues was constant’. Constant but deceptive, perhaps.Mr Whittingdale said it looked as if Mrs May had tried to ‘circumvent’ her Cabinet. Mr Robbins, who began most of his answers with ‘so’, said ‘it’s certainly not a picture I or the Prime Minister would recognise’.    Theresa May’s head of the Europe unit at number 10 Downing Street Olly Robbins was undergoing a spot of parliamentary scrutiny today. He has been given powers that arguably usurp those of HM Secretary of State for Brexit, Dominic RaabMr Robbins’s enhanced powers were confirmed in a parliamentary written answer published a few minutes before yesterday’s committee hearing.It confirmed a ‘change of government machinery’ which all but emasculates the Brexit department.Craig Mackinlay (Con, S Thanet) said: ‘I feel a coup d’etat has been going on.’ Mr Robbins: ‘So, Mr Mackinlay, I honestly don’t recognise the picture.’Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con, NE Somerset) wondered when Mr Robbins had started writing his Chequers papers. ‘These papers had their origins in other papers,’ said Mr Robbins. See how sneaky they are at this sort of thing? He finally conceded that the first versions of the Chequers papers were written ‘about a fortnight’ earlier.Mr Rees-Mogg, with deadly politeness, said he did not hold Mr Robbins responsible for a ‘worrying’ breakdown in Cabinet government. Mr Robbins thanked him. Mr Rees-Mogg now said that he blamed Mrs May. Mr Robbins gave a pale gulp, wishing he had not been so quick to thank the Mogg.It is often said Tony Blair lied to ministers and to Parliament when he took us into the Iraq War, and that his dishonesty wrecked public trust in our political system.If Mrs May has just misled her own ministers, on a national strategic relationship with the EU which may impede our economy for decades, her reputation will sink as low as that of the sharply hated Blair.

Spijker’s trademark twin TVs behind the bar – one showing porn, and one with cartoons (today it’s Snow White) – have been there since the 80s. Punters would sometimes do a double take, Wielinga remembers, when they recognised him in the onscreen action.Upstairs, though, the voyeur mirrors around the urinals have gone and the famous dark room is now more of a cupboard – illustrating the bar’s shift from prime cruising spot to a place to meet friends.The city beyond the bar echoes this change, with mass tourism now engulfing Amsterdam’s gay scene, and gay and straight visitors partying side by side. Since the late 90s, budget air travel has attracted stag parties and other young weekenders, drawn to the red light district and coffee shops, creating a lucrative market for property investors and squeezing the gay bars out.When the Spijker opened on Amsterdam’s Kerkstraat in 1978, the area was bursting with gay bars and hotels, and the Leidsestraat – cutting through it and book-ended with gay discos – was nicknamed the “Rue de Vaseline”. Spijker was known for its most beautiful butt competition, in which the winner received a 100-guilder note between their bum cheeks. In 1983, when the bar came under the ownership of theatre enthusiast Raphael Brandow, it even opened its own 65-seat repertory theatre, staging experimental pieces as well as jolly musicals. The epidemic demonstrated the importance of the Spijker community and brought its customers closer together. Under a new owner, New Yorker Tony Derosa, the Spijker responded to the Aids crisis and re-engaged a reeling community by organising safe-sex parties during which marshals would circulate carrying trays of condoms and making sure the house rules were observed.“We were a family and it was a support system,” says Mancunian Paul Tarrant, 57, the Spijker’s current owner, who started at the bar as a cleaner and condom distributor in 1995. “In those days, people needed people to confide in.”Today, the gay heartlands of the Kerkstraat, the Reguliersdwarsstraat and the red light district are struggling to survive. Since 2010, gay bars such as Argos, Bar Arc, Bump, Café April, Café Soho, Cockring and Havana – to name a few – have all shut up shop despite an action programme launched by the municipality in 2009 to re-establish Amsterdam as the gay capital of Europe. Bankruptcy is the biggest cause, but drugs busts and rent arrears have also forced closures. Now touristy bars, restaurants and karaoke joints serving a mixed crowd have taken their place.Amsterdam’s cruise bars never really recovered from the Aids epidemic, he says, which knocked out a whole generation of business people and tainted the sex industry. Cruising patterns have since changed and the sector has failed to adapt. “Gay business has stopped being inventive and new and fashionable … There’s a lot where you go in and they’re still playing Eurovision … I don’t think we’re giving people what they want.”Gay dating apps such as Grindr and Hornet have also made gay bars increasingly obsolete.“In the 70s, 80s and 90s, you needed to get out of your house you needed to go to a park or a bar or a discotheque,” says Wielinga. “I remember all those long nights, hunting men like crazy … With the apps, you can have sex with your neighbour.”Tarrant believes emancipation is also a factor in the scene’s decline. His regulars tend to be over 40. “The younger gay people don’t need gay bars any more,” he says. “They have empowerment now.“The typical 90s gay scene is changing,” agrees Janine Fluyt, spokesperson for Amsterdam Marketing, but says Amsterdam is still known as “the open, tolerant and inclusive city, where everyone is welcome”. Gay tourism is still thriving here, she says, but is now more about festivals such as Milkshake and Pride. In this changing climate, the Spijker has done well to outlive so many of its competitors. To celebrate its 40th anniversary, the bar will have its own boat in the canal parade on the 4 August, the highlight of Pride Amsterdam. This year the theme is “heroes”, and the Spijker crew will be commemorating the bar’s early days by dressing as gay icons of the 70s, including Tom of Finland, who once drank at the bar. The orgies are no more. Now it’s bingo night, hosted each Saturday by drag act Miss Didi Licious, that draws the biggest crowd. The strength of the Spijker, says Tarrant, has really always been the social aspect rather than the cruise scene: “You can come in here on your own and you don’t know anybody and they’ll say, ‘Hi, how are you doing?’ … It’s just so friendly.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05bab29fe2c1a0d81f441d3ff21d8a61104066a2/0_87_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b57f9bf0c48ddb308f98246353cb3dad","title":"1976 long hot summer political upheaval","story":"The sense of ease in Britain over those months was not a total delusion. Yet the year brought huge political upheavalJust like this year’s, the heatwave in 1976 arrived as Britain seemed to be approaching an economic and political abyss. During the spring and early summer, as the sun began to hammer down and the usual rain failed to fall, and the reservoirs began to shrink, the pound was lurching downwards on the markets. For almost three years, under Tory and Labour governments, the economy had been shrivelling alarmingly. Just as since the Brexit vote, a conviction had been building like a thundercloud among financial traders and business leaders, economists and commentators, in Britain and beyond, that the country was about to slip to a lower, less elite level, and stay there. “Goodbye, Great Britain,” said a much-read editorial in the Wall Street Journal in 1975, “it was nice knowing you.”If you remember the British summer of 1976 we\u0027d like to hear from you. What do you remember? How does it compare to this year? You can share your photos and memories by filling in this encrypted form. One of our journalists may be in touch and we will consider some of your responses in our reporting. You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere.To some pessimists about Britain’s prospects, the drought the following summer, which brought forest fires, crop failures, hosepipe bans enforced by policemen and vigilantes, and standpipes on street corners instead of mains water, was a further sign of crisis. In 1976, with impeccable timing, the American writer Paul Theroux published The Family Arsenal, a bleakly satirical novel about terrorists on the loose in a sweaty, rundown mid-70s London, its “decay pushing towards ruin”. Some sort of apocalypse, predicted one of the characters, was “certainly coming”.But the Labour chancellor, Denis Healey, was not one of the worriers. In the summer of 1976, after several exhausting months trying to defend his economic policies and the value of the pound, he went on holiday for most of August. He left sticky London behind and drove unhurriedly through England and Wales and up to north-west Scotland. “Not a drop of rain,” he wrote in his memoirs, “even in the Highlands.” In the hidden away lochside town of Ullapool, Healey checked into a hotel on the quayside and began to relax.That night, he was repeatedly woken by phone calls from Whitehall. In the US currency markets, the pound was collapsing again. The hotel had only one phone, so the chancellor stood in a hallway with a coat over his pyjamas, authorising the Bank of England to spend “up to $150m” (about £750m now) to buy sterling. The intervention worked: the pound stopped falling. Healey went back to bed, and then continued with his holiday.Hot weather does contradictory things to British politics. In parliament, with its stuffy rooms and sweaty dress codes, it traditionally sparks revolts, plots, panics and flashes of temper – a sense that things are coming to a head – as it has this summer. Yet away from Westminster, a heatwave can make politicians, and even more so voters, worry less than usual about the state of the nation. In an overcast country, sunshine often means contentment and escapism – and procrastination. During July and August 1976, despite the state of the economy and a widespread disillusionment with centre-left politics (which had been deepening since the late 60s), the Labour government pulled level with the Conservatives in the polls. Healey was generally seen as a tough, capable chancellor. The prime minister, Jim Callaghan, had an avuncular, calming manner that seemed appropriate to the summer lull. Voters called him Sunny Jim.Theresa May has none of Callaghan’s sly charm. But her situation this summer is similar in some ways. As in 1976, a ided government in a weak parliamentary position, wedded to increasingly contested ideas – for Callaghan, postwar social democracy, for May, austerity and the free market – has somehow made it to the welcome shade of the recess, despite many predictions to the contrary. The main opposition party remains ominously strong, but it has an intensely isive leader whom many voters see as odd and extremist: in this sense, Margaret Thatcher was the Jeremy Corbyn of the mid-70s.And, just as Callaghan did, May has managed to put off the most difficult political question of her government until the autumn. In 1976, this was whether Britain could afford to continue with its postwar levels of state spending now it is how to do Brexit. Yet during what might be a once-in-a-generation summer – as the sun keeps shining, day after day, and the parks are full of impromptu skivers, the pubs are full of workers having cheeky afternoon lagers, and even supposedly earnest protest marches feel more like carnivals – such national dilemmas can feel very distant.In the summer of 1976, the sense of ease was not a total delusion. Twenty-eight years later, the respected New Economics Foundation created a measure for overall economic, social and environmental wellbeing, and concluded that 1976 was the best year in modern British history.For those invested in the idea that the 70s were a nadir for Britain – pro-Thatcher historians, and hipper archivists of the punk rebellion against the mid-70s status quo – the summer of 1976 has always been an awkward piece of counter-evidence. Yet as Jon Savage pointed out in his 1991 book England’s Dreaming, still the best, most nuanced study of punk and its political and social context, the heatwave actually helped the movement. After dark, the rare warmth gave the first British punks a sense of possibility, and a freedom, as they roamed between squats and nightclubs. In a normal British summer, it would have been hard to stay out all night in punk outfits full of holes.The summer of 2018 feels less carefree. We know more about climate change and skin cancer now. This week, forecast to be the hottest of the season, the Met Office is advising people to stay out of the sun. And the world beyond Britain feels more genuinely apocalyptic, and harder to ignore. We face Trump and a Europe increasingly controlled by far-right populists in the summer of 1976, the continent was dominated by centrists, and the insurgent shaking up US politics was a mild, almost meek Democrat, Jimmy Carter. Even the cold war seemed to be abating, thanks to the disarmament treaties and subtle diplomacy of detente.But we shouldn’t idealise the summer of 1976 too much. Away from its unexpected pleasures, pressures were still building in Britain. In August the guitarist Eric Clapton near the peak of his fame, used a concert in Birmingham to make a speech defending the anti-immigrant prejudices of Enoch Powell. At the end of the month, the Notting Hill carnival in London turned into a battle between the police and black youths, a prefiguring of the many riots in the decade to come.Also in late August the heatwave finally disintegrated in a mess of thunderstorms. A soaking, grey autumn followed. The pound resumed its decline, the government’s finances deteriorated further, Whitehall panicked – or, some say, exploited the situation – and the government ended up drastically cutting its spending, and accepting a loan from the IMF. The reputations of Healey and Callaghan, their government, and postwar social democracy, never quite recovered.Once the summer interlude of 1976 was over, Britain changed very fast – and in many ways not for the good. Perhaps that’s something for Theresa May, and the rest of us, to ponder while we enjoy the sun.• Andy Beckett is a feature writer for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58ff548d4d945df6cab1c0886184a0dc07d3022a/0_337_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c9b6b2ee06577313435cb75c442e70","title":"conservatives brexit big business","story":"It’s a remarkable thing to witness: senior Conservatives attacking big business. It is not just Boris Johnson exclaiming “fuck business” – it is their furious and sustained response to the corporations threatening to disinvest after Brexit, exemplified by the resignation of the Welsh Conservative leader after his attack on Airbus.Most remarkable – and least remarked upon – is an article in the Daily Mail a couple of weeks ago by the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, in which he rehearses what anti-corporate campaigners have been saying for decades. “The public,” he complained, “is urged to accept, without challenge, the views of corporations and their representative bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry.” According to this “fashionable narrative”, the opinions of corporate chief executives “should count for much more than the decisions of voters exercised through the democratic ballot box”.Who are the authors of this “fashionable narrative”? Among them is a certain Iain Duncan Smith, as you can see from the speech he gave as party leader to the CBI in 2001. Oh, and just about every senior Conservative over the past four decades. Yet this astonishing article passed almost without comment in the rest of the billionaire press. What is going on?One of the hidden conflicts Brexit has exposed is the contradiction between what Conservatives claim to stand for – something called conservatism – and what they really represent. Everything conservatism is supposed to defend – tradition, continuity, community, national character, the physical fabric of the nation – is ripped apart by the demands of capital, whose permanent revolution the Conservative party assists and accelerates.The contradictions run throughout conservative Britain. As a young man, I was amazed to see the burghers of middle England look the other way as their beautiful market towns were turned into car parks and the glorious countryside that surrounded them into chemical deserts. They claimed to love a national character exemplified by independent butchers, bakers and greengrocers, but shopped at Tesco. They didn’t blink while our national institutions – universities, schools, the BBC, the NHS, the rule of law – were vitiated by corporate interests. As a road-building programme driven by the demands of construction companies ripped through ancient monuments and nature reserves, they did nothing, leaving hippies and anarchists to defend our national heritage.I began to realise that the whole thing was a racket. Conservatism professed to be one thing, but in reality was its opposite. Everything could and should be sacrificed to money and its organised form: corporate power. Stripped of its professed adherence to tradition and continuity, all that is left of conservatism is property paranoia, xenophobia and a patriotism so coarse and ill-defined that it loses all meaning. This makes it easy to manipulate. When transnational corporations cannot be blamed for ripping apart communities and national character, immigrants must be blamed instead. A paper by Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig at Bocconi University found that, while there was no relationship between the number of migrants in a region and the extent to which it voted leave, there was a powerful relationship between the leave vote and what they call “Chinese import shock”: the displacement of local businesses and jobs by imports. Brexit was driven, they say, by the uncompensated effects of globalised trade. But as the instigators of the leave campaign were beholden to financial interests, such effects were unmentionable. So scapegoats had to be found.It would be delightful to imagine that people such as Duncan Smith and Johnson are seeking to defend democracy and popular sovereignty from the perennial threat of corporate power. Nothing could be further from the truth. Intimately associated with the campaign to disentangle us from the EU is an effort to entangle us further with a more distant and less amenable power: the United States. Food, environmental and workplace standards must succumb to the maelstrom of US corporate lobbying and the demand that everything on Earth is exchangeable for something else.As foreign secretary, Johnson granted free use of rooms in the Foreign Office to the Initiative for Free Trade, a group of dark-money thinktanks that see Brexit as an opportunity to rip down public protections. The trade secretary, Liam Fox, is seeking to force the UK into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, whose radical assault on standards, and secretive offshore courts, present a far greater threat to national sovereignty than does the European Union. US and UK banks have already seized their chance, threatening to walk away from London after Brexit unless they get further tax cuts and a new round of deregulation. They have plainly forgotten what caused the last financial crisis. Broadly speaking, Brextremists such as Fox, Johnson and Duncan Smith favour the most ruthless and antisocial businesses over more responsible ones.Even so, the unusual conflict between transnational corporations and senior Conservatives should also discomfit defenders of the European Union. Why are big companies so keen to stay in? Because the EU, in essence, is a vehicle for their expansion. By regularising standards within the bloc and striking trade deals that are, to a large extent, fashioned by business lobbyists, it helps big companies to sweep away smaller competitors, and extends corporate power at the expense of democracy. As I’ve long argued, as a Eurosceptic remainer, the EU is like democracy, diplomacy and old age: the only thing that can be said for it is that it’s better than the alternative. The alternative is hideous.If established corporate power is perceived as an obstacle by senior Conservatives, it is not because a higher principle is at stake. It is simply because it conflicts with a more immediate aim: a Brexit that can be played to the advantage of one faction and the disadvantage of another.But as the contradictions emerge between what the Conservatives profess to be and what they are, it is instructive to watch the party split, as it did around the repeal of the Corn Laws, over the competing interests of different forms of capital. Expect this struggle to continue. But don’t expect to see anything resembling conservatism to materialise, on either side. Perhaps it is time they renamed their party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e9252020ee92c3bfc08d43bee19853dd4e2c7fd/0_569_2652_1591/master/2652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2df4e2df29fdf284006fe30301cbc577","title":"girls female scientists jess wade wikipedia stem role models","story":"As Dr Jess Wade, postdoctoral researcher in plastic electronics at Imperial College London, continues her mission of adding women in science to Wikipedia, she highlights a key problem with many “women into science” projects: a lack of evidence that they work. “There’s so much energy, enthusiasm and money going into all these initiatives to get girls into science. Absolutely none of them is evidence-based and none of them works. It’s so unscientific, that’s what really surprises me,” she says.You wouldn’t know it from marketing campaigns such as EDF Energy’s Pretty Curious competition or IBM’s #HackAHairDryer campaign, but there’s a solid body of research from which advocates can draw inspiration. We know that, for example, role models play a crucial part in developing girls’ and women’s interests. Studies by Girlguiding UK have shown that girls value role models and that a lack of role models puts them off careers such as engineering. And a psychologist, Penelope Lockwood, found that women needed female role models to illustrate that success was attainable.By adding more pages to Wikipedia, Wade is expanding women’s representation on one of the most-read websites in the world. It’s a noble mission that mirrors the work of projects such as TrowelBlazers, highlighting women in archaeology, palaeontology and geology, and Ada Lovelace Day, an annual global celebration of women in science that I founded, which has featured many Wikipedia “edit-a-thons” over the last 10 years.There are so many amazing and inspiring women in science that it’s hard to choose between them. But here are five whose work and achievements make them great role models for us all.The only British woman to have won a Nobel prize for science, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin was among the first to use X-ray crystallography to reveal the structure of antibiotics, vitamins and proteins such as cholesterol, penicillin, Vitamin B12 and insulin. Her work established X-ray crystallography as the best way to investigate the properties and functions of many biological molecules. Crowfoot Hodgkin understood the importance of computers, including many programmers in her research team and, in 1959, persuading Oxford University to buy a Mercury computer. She was awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1964.Dr Patricia Bath’s Laserphaco Probe is a medical device to remove cataracts, one of the leading causes of vision loss and blindness. In 1981, Bath began working on a design that used a laser instead of ultrasound, making the process less invasive, faster and more accurate. Bath patented her idea in 1988, becoming the first African-American woman to receive a medical patent. The Laserphaco Probe also removes diseased corneas, and Bath used it to restore sight to a woman who had been blind for more than 30 years.Professor Tu Youyou is a pharmaceutical chemist who won the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015 for her discovery of the drugs artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin. Her drugs have been used to treat 200 million malaria patients, saving millions of lives. In 1967, Tu began testing more than 2,000 herbal recipes in her search for a new anti-malarial drug. Her breakthrough was using cold water, instead of hot, to prepare an extract of qinghao, or sweet wormwood. After successful animal tests, Tu volunteered to be the first human subject.Known as the Shark Lady, Dr Eugenie Clark was the founding director of the Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida, and a prolific and inspirational writer. Clark proved that sharks can learn simple tasks, discovered that the Moses sole secretes an effective shark repellent and debunked the myth that sharks need to swim to breathe. Clark pioneered the use of scuba ing in marine biology and continued her research well into “retirement”, learning to pilot a sub when she was 87.During the 1960s space race, Yvonne Brill developed a more lightweight, accurate and flexible propulsion system for communications satellites. She combined hydrazine, a propellant that gives off heat when it decomposes in the presence of a catalyst, with the resistojet, a thruster that heats a propellant, vaporising it and creating thrust from the gas’s expansion. She began her patent application for the electrothermal hydrazine thruster in 1967. Although the patent was granted in 1974, it wasn’t until 1983 that Brill saw her invention tested. It’s now an industry standard.With more and more businesses recognising that they’re missing out on this kind of talent because women are dissuaded from pursuing science careers, there’s a temptation to pour money into more marketing campaigns and stunts. But what’s really needed is for companies to take a more rigorous, evidence-based approach and to work with, and fund, those in the field who already know what works and what doesn’t.Girls and women don’t need gimmicks to get into science they need year-round access to resources, role models and support.• Suw Charman-Anderson is the founder of Ada Lovelace Day, an international celebration of the achievements of women in Stem"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d93739a706299f79085122535ba156ac8a510f3/153_129_3489_2094/master/3489.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6763e336e545d2db02fba8907498da5","title":"propaganda putin russia elections","story":"This summer, the World Cup created the illusion Russia was a well-run country with a contented population. But now the sports pageantry is over, Russians are back to the grey reality of everyday life, and a dire lack of prospects. And the idea of the nation being united around Vladimir Putin is fiction.Russia is often presented in binary terms: as a country ided between Putinists and liberals, rich and poor, rural folks and Moscovites, “slavophiles” and westerners. The Kremlin’s narrative hinges on the notion of a “patriotic” Russia constantly overcoming a minuscule opposition, depicted as a “fifth column” that is activated or manipulated by external forces. It is tempting for foreign observers to adopt such a black-and-white vision, in which the leader is dominant and admired while his doubters are an exception.In fact, there are three Russias. The first is Putin’s Russia, built on an oligarchic power structure and its massive propaganda machine. The second is the average man’s Russia, with its many facets but also its common problems. The third is of the professional elites and upper-middle class, who benefited from the economic boom of the 2000s and now have much to lose.The overwhelming majority of Russia’s 140 million people worry about declining living standards, falling health and education levels, material insecurity, and corruption. A few weeks ago, protests erupted in many regions and across social classes against a government plan to raise the pension age (polls show that eight out of 10 Russians oppose the reform). This demonstrated a swell of mistrust in the authorities, with many people doubting that the Putin system has their best interests at heart. Furthermore, sociologists at the independent Levada Centre in Moscow point to a rising pessimism. Despite TV propaganda – or perhaps because of it – more\u0026nbspand more Russians say they are gloomy about their\u0026nbsppersonal prospects, as well as about the country’s future. There is also concern about military involvement\u0026nbspin Ukraine and Syria, and the toll these conflicts are having on young soldiers.What about the elites? It is important to distinguish between the ruling group (Putin’s network of security services, officials and oligarchs), and the non-ruling elites and upper-middle class, which is made up of a few million scientists, intellectuals, local or regional civil servants, teachers and entrepreneurs. Against a backdrop of corruption and budget restrictions, these people often struggle to run a hospital, a school, a local administration, a factory they manage their own business, or teach, create, innovate. It is they who bear the difficult task of acting as a mediating layer between the people and the ruling class. Many of them feel powerless but remain loyal to the regime.Over the past decade, however, many professionals have packed their bags and left Russia. Tens of thousands now live in Europe, North America, Ukraine, Georgia and a few Asian cities. They follow events in Russia closely, and many hope to one day go back and be involved in a post-Putin Russia. However hard the Kremlin may try to dismiss this phenomenon (with its “good riddance” messaging), Russia’s brain and talent drain is a new and genuine challenge for the regime. Behind his bombast, Putin fears a combination of both grassroots and elite mobilisation. Popular complaints can become a threat if they’re amplified by intellectuals, journalists and opposition politicians. The exceptional popularity of Navalny and his anti-corruption foundation shows a new politics in the making. The navalny website has millions of followers. A video describing the Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev’s personal wealth has been watched more than 20 million times. A significant number of Navalny’s supporters are young and fearless.Domestic social anger, civic demands, youth opposition and “temporary diasporas” may converge to create difficulties for Putin. His options would then be limited: resort to more political repression, which would keep the country in a sterile deadlock, or he could seek compromise – but that would mean taking the risk of loosening his grip on power and wealth.As it is, Putin shows no intention of leaving the Kremlin or preparing his succession, no matter the economic downsides or the discontent of the upper-middle class. There are no prominent, serious reformers in the government he appointed in May, and it’s chaired by a weakened Medvedev. Economic experts expect low growth and mounting social problems in the years to come.Ultimately, the quest for global power may not be enough to unify a fragmented society and its various elites around the strongman. Russians expect better protection against declining living standards, and many suspect the purpose of the pension reform is to ert yet more money towards military expenditure and personal enrichment. The regime tries to deflect attention from a depressed domestic economy by provoking confrontations with the west, but it is costly, unproductive and not very popular. Putin will stick to this course, though, rather than take the risk of liberalisation and accountability.Russia’s leadership, worried elites and pessimistic society are in an unstable equilibrium. The three Russias are becoming more aware of how precarious the situation is. They’re watching each other closely. Putinism as a formula for stability has run its course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ad9424dfb45e51065e776eceb15a744391c587d/0_167_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee7d6f38615612fc8fd3ff9c3c62030","title":"second brexit referendum toxic waste time","story":"Please, not again. Personally, the last thing I want is another EU referendum. But what I want is, of course, neither here nor there. What matters is that another popular vote will not be all its increasing number of supporters are cracking it up to be.Obviously, a new referendum would pose a number of practical problems. Not least, as former Conservative party leader William Hague has pointed out, it would necessitate another act of parliament. Remember, the bill for the 2016 referendum took seven months to pass. Add the time required to designate the campaigns and hold the vote itself (and even allowing for “cutting and pasting” some of the parliamentary work from 2015 to speed things up), and it is clear that it would be difficult to have a result before the UK’s date of departure from the EU on 29 March 2019.Yet put such practical arguments aside. Assume that, if need be, the EU would allow a pause in the article 50 process for us to hold a second vote. How would a new referendum be any different to the first? A number of different arguments have been advanced. These range from the claim that the facts have changed since 2016, to the assertion that a new referendum would be of a higher quality than the first because more facts are available, to Greening’s claim – reiterated by Bogdanor – that a “parliament in stalemate” cannot deliver Brexit.But will the facts really be any clearer at the end of this year than they were in 2016? The Economist claimed that, this time round, the different alternatives available could be costed. But would clear alternatives really be available? And, given the nature of the Brexit debate, would it matter if they were, even if their implications could indeed be reliably modelled?The answer to each of these questions is no. Any referendum held before the UK leaves the EU would not be held on a clear plan for future UK-EU relations. As the clock ticks down to the article 50 deadline, there are real doubts as to whether sufficient time remains to finalise even a withdrawal agreement, let alone a clear outline of a future relationship.The best we can hope for on the latter is an aspirational political declaration with no legal force. Phrased as vaguely as the time constraints imply it must be, this will not provide a firm basis for informed debate. Instead, expect another campaign replete with competing claims about competing futures.And this in a country where, as one observer has put it, we all now have our own facts anyway. Given the anger a second vote would generate amongst leave voters who would feel cheated, it is hard to see how calm and rational debate over empirical forecasts would be possible. And it’s worth emphasising just how profound the isions in our country are. Sara Hobolt of the London School of Economics is doing some fascinating work on the cognitive biases induced by the 2016 vote, underlining how, post-referendum, UK citizens see politics through new “Brexit-tinted” lenses. These have served to bolster pre-existing attitudes on issues such as the economy and immigration. What are the odds a new vote will reverse or counteract this impact rather than reinforce it?Finally, as far as the argument about a gridlocked parliament is concerned, the irony is that, on this at least, our representatives are indeed representative of the British people. Neither in Westminster nor among the public at large can a majority be found for any one Brexit outcome.There would at least be a point to another vote if there was a realistic expectation that a clear majority could be found one way or another for a clear alternative. That might hold out the possibility of an outcome seen as legitimate.But the polls reveal a public stubbornly ided, and, despite a shift towards a slight majority believing that the vote to leave was the wrong decision, the margin is small enough to prevent any certainty as to the outcome of any popular vote. Whatever the result, it seems unlikely to provide a significant majority either way.A narrow victory for remain – the outcome which, let’s face it, most proponents of a second referendum desire – would solve none of the underlying problems that led to the Brexit vote in the first place. Rather, it would provide grist to the mill to opponents of the EU, and the establishment would be portrayed as having betrayed leave voters.A semi-competent Ukip (far from guaranteed, admittedly) or even a new successor party would make hay in the 2019 European parliament elections. The Tories would remain as ided – probably even more so – as they were when David Cameron caved to pressure from Brexiters on his own benches and called the referendum in the first place. And leavers would continue to believe that warnings of dire consequences should we leave the EU were simply fictions. The ide in values in British society that burst into the open following the 2016 vote would remain entrenched, reinforcing the problems already faced by our party system in attempting to contain it.Of course, things might change. An extension to the article 50 process, which prolongs British membership, may for example provide more time for a trade deal to be negotiated and hence the space for a more considered debate about a clearer set of alternatives. Yet the politics of the Conservative party militate strongly against such an outcome – at least for now.And in the absence of such a development, the prospectus for a new vote is far from convincing. Removing the decision from the hands of deadlocked politicians to give it to a deadlocked public is no solution at all. Particularly as an already bitterly ided public would have no clear choice to vote on, no time for proper deliberation, and would remain as ided as they already are.Another referendum, hurried through in the time available, would not be a higher-calibre version of the original. It would be a rerun, with arguments about an ill-defined future between camps who no longer listen to each other (insofar as they ever did). So, on reflection, please not again.

In which case, as concepts go, this one will be music to your ears. Or rather balm for your sunburn.The heatwave has created a need for cooling off that extends beyond a cold shower – and so the current trend for coldness in the world of wellness, beauty and exercise feels timely given that for years it’s been all about Bikram yoga, hot-cloth cleansing and saunas. But is this penchant for the cold more than a whim? Or is it simply the latest fad to be commodified by the wellness industry?Extolling the virtues of being cold is actually nothing new. Cold bathing, ground-zero of the movement, dates back to Hippocrates, with the proposed benefits as murky as any plunge pool – cold showers purport to increase circulation, reduce stress, kickstart your immune system and release endorphins as well as cooling you down. I started finishing my hot shower with an icy blast after a friend who takes cold showers every morning told me he had never felt better. Parking the science for a moment, the benefits were clear from the off. It follows the theory set by the French epigrammist Nicolas Chamfort: “a man should swallow a toad every morning to be sure of not meeting with anything more revolting in the day ahead”. In short, it’s rooted in unpleasantness but that’s precisely why you do it the rest of the day is a breeze from there.Even cold yoga is carving out a similar niche. Brrrn, a new fitness studio in Manhattan, which opened in May, has a yoga class performed in 16C (61F), as well as setting its gym temperature at 7C (45F). At Frame in London, yoga classes are now routinely taken with the door open, where the emphasis used to be on retaining heat.And then there are ice-rollers, designed to help de-puff your skin and reduce redness, although an ice cube may well also do the trick. “I’m reluctant to say coldness will actually change your skin, but it’s obviously pleasant to have cold things on your face,” says the skin expert Dr Mervyn Patterson. “And you could argue that if you have swelling under the eye, a cold compress might help.”In many ways, it feels like a fad. The wellness industry has blown up exponentially in the past few years – and dichotomising consumers and changing trends are good for business. There are those that follow an eight-step cleansing routine. And those who pride themselves on paring it all down and going back to nature.If this explosion feels out of step with feminist discourse – all the lotions and potions that are packaged, however covertly, towards making a “better you” – then it is possible coldness has sprung from the same well that being cold is the pinnacle of a pared down, natural – even macho – wellness. Wim Hof, the Dutch wellness guru, has a cult-like status for suggesting cold-body therapy is the key to good health.We will be sorry when the heatwave has gone, of course. But until that day comes, until the grass turns green and the sea returns to its icy norm – until this heatwave is over – thank goodness coldness is all the rage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de4eaca9e826e371952a08c24f49e119e8426efb/0_68_2025_1215/master/2025.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f21349cb64be2bef1f13709e44f7848","title":"93queen the incredible story of the all female hasidic emergency service","story":"In a new documentary, the brave work of a group of rule-breaking women in an Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn is brought to lightFor many years, Hasidic women in the Brooklyn community of Borough Park had a problem.If they were stricken by illness, accident or even suddenly went into labor, their only ambulance option was the local branch of the Hatzolah, a volunteer emergency service set up to serve the Jewish community.The Hatzolah are good the crews have a response time of one to two minutes. But the Hatzolah are also all male – a very real issue in a religion and community which orders strict separation of genders. It meant Hasidic women needing emergency medical attention would sometimes refrain from calling for an ambulance.“Women were too embarrassed to call for help and then didn’t call for help,” said Paula Eiselt, the director of 93Queen, a new documentary which follows the efforts of Hasidic women in Borough Park to set up their own, all female, ambulance service.“I read a story of a woman who actually passed away because she was having a heart attack and her hair wasn’t covered and she hesitated and waited,” she said.Eiselt spent four years tracking their journey in the Brooklyn neighborhood, which has one of the largest Orthodox Jewish communities in the US, for a film which offers a rare glimpse into a closely guarded area.We see the film’s main protagonist, driven lawyer Rachel “Ruchie” Freier, fight against sexist attitudes in the Hasidic community as she cajoles and encourages her group of women into training as paramedics. Freier is bombarded with abusive messages as she strives to set up the service, and local online community boards are flooded with angry messages.“I sometimes wonder why God created me a woman. If I’d have been born a Hasidic man, I don’t think I would have half the problems I have,” Freier says at one point in the film. “So much of the things that I want to do are that much harder because I’m a woman.”Part of the vitriol is aimed at Freier’s rising public profile as she sets up the all-woman service, called Ezras Nashim. She receives an email accusing her of lacking “values of modesty and tzniut” – the latter describing a set of Jewish laws insisting that people, especially women, should behave in a way that does not attract attention. Eiselt said that concept typically makes it difficult for the media to gain access.“It’s definitely a very challenging community to get access to. I think there’s kind of a contentious relationship with media,” Eiselt said.As an Orthodox Jew herself, Eiselt said she was able to build relationships with Freier and the other women in the film, giving her access to homes and the training sessions as they build up knowledge of how to perform CPR and deliver babies, among other skills.Freier and the others carry on going in the face of the patriarchy, eventually earning recognition from the New York fire department, which assigns Ezras Nashim the radio call sign 93Q – 93Queen. But while the commitment and effort the Ezras Nashim women show is admirable, it’s hard not to feel uncomfortable at the subordinate role they are forced to play in their Hasidic community.We hear some of the women talk about how they have had to sacrifice their careers because of the pressure to have children young and then raise them, with minimal input from male family members. Freier, after a hard night spent working on the Ezras Nashim project, comes home and begins to prepare food for her family at 3am. Against that backdrop, it is jarring to hear one of Freier’s daughters discuss her dream of being a brain surgeon – “nine years of college and then residency”, she says – when she grows up.“The problem is once you hit 22, it starts getting harder to date,” her sister, who can’t be older than 14, tells her.In Eiselt’s opinion, however, things are moving in the right direction in this Borough Park enclave – if slowly.“I think a big takeaway for me is you know feminism doesn’t look the same in every community. The way feminism looks in Borough Park is not the way feminism looks like in secular New York City,” she said.“Just because her progress may not be at the point where we think it should be, this is the first step and if we’re going to say: ‘What you’re doing isn’t good enough,’ then what’s the point of them even doing anything?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a494279a419ba9de086698ca7f1116c7489032c/0_22_1676_1006/master/1676.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3f0da023c365fb78052ef7940ea166c","title":"which football club has made the biggest profit on a player in their 30s","story":"Plus: players who left teams heading for relegation and won the European Cup in the same season deliberate own goals and average teams. Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Real Madrid made an £8m profit on Cristiano Ronaldo when they sold him to Juventus for £88m. He’s 33! What’s the biggest profit made by a club on a player in their thirties?” wonders George Jones.Cristiano Ronaldo may have obliterated the transfer record for a player in his 30s but, when it comes to profit, he is not the king. It’s hard to give exact figures because of exchange rates and conflicting reports of some transfer fees – hence the use of ‘around’ approximately 472 times in this answer – but we can safely say that at least two thirtysomethings have earned their former clubs a greater profit than Himself.Fiorentina made around £20m when they sold Gabriel Batistuta to Roma in 2000. Batistuta moved to Florence from Boca Juniors for around £1.5m in 1991 and was sold for £22m nine years later and at the age of 31. He was, until recently, both the most expensive and the most profitable thirtysomething. But, as Jozef Brodala points out, Leonardo Bonucci grabbed both crowns last summer when he moved from Juventus to Milan for around £35.2m: they signed him for around £11m, which means a value of £24.2m.Never mind all these superstars – Rob Fielding has a far more interesting footnote. “If we’re talking percentage profit then I reckon you may struggle to beat Port Vale’s John Rudge’s wheeling and dealing,” says Rob. “In 1988, he purchased a 32-year-old Ron Futcher for £35,000. Futcher was Rudge’s sixth choice but he helped to inspire the Valiants to promotion via the play-offs. “No wonder Sir Alex Ferguson once said of Rudge – ‘Every game I go to, he’s there with his “bonnet” on, and that’s dedication. Port Vale should go down on their knees and thank the Lord for having him. We all dread a phone call from John with his “I’ve got no money, what’ve you got, I fancy this one” routine. Eventually he gets a cheap player and turns him into a better one.’”Have we missed anybody? Let us know at knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.“Virgil van Dijk started last season at Southampton, who were close to going down, and ended it with Liverpool who were close to becoming European champions. Has anyone played for a team that have gone down and won the European Cup in the same season?” enquires Mike Coxon.Thanks to those of you who pointed out two prominent examples of this. The first is Trevor Francis, who started the 1978-79 season with Birmingham, who would be relegated, and finished it by scoring the winning goal in the European Cup final for Nottingham Forest.Gary Cahill also successfully deserted a sinking ship in 2011-12. He started the season with Bolton and moved to Chelsea in January. Four months later he started in their Champions League victory over Bayern Munich.Noble Francis also has an interesting variation on this theme. “Carlos Alberto de Jesus played for the Fluminense side that finished 19th out of 24 teams in 2003 in the (Campeonato Brasileiro) Série A,” he writes. “Then he moved to José Mourinho’s Porto in January 2004 and won the (Portuguese) Primeira Liga and European Cup by May.” Not bad. In October 2012 we looked at players to have scored deliberate own goals (featuring 149 in one match) in protest against their club, their manager or the referee. And though this email in response doesn’t exactly fit the bill, it’s an enjoyable yarn nevertheless:“Austria’s greatest football coach ever, Ernst Happel, loved to score own goals during his playing days against his teammate and close friend Walter Zeman,” wrote Jörg Michner. “Both played for Rapid Vienna and the Austrian national team, Happel being a defender and Zeman obviously a goalkeeper. When Rapid were crushing the opposition, as they often did in the 1940s and 50s, Happel used to get bored at the back and occasionally took the ball, scored an own goal and taunted Zeman: “Lucky for you I didn’t hit you in the head or else you’d be dead,” he would shout in broad Viennese at his keeper. When Austria were preparing for the 1954 World Cup against a local selection in Innsbruck, with the score 14-0 to Austria, a bored Happel put the ball into his own net from 20 metres out.”• For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the archive.“Following the Malcom saga, it got me wondering about other last-minute transfer switches. What are the latest times in a transfer process that a player has backed out of one deal for another?”“Can any team to be more average than Bristol Rovers?” asks Gerry Prewett. “After the end of last season, the Gas had played a total of 4,030 League games from the time they joined the League in 1920 (including their one season in the Conference).

While supporters appreciated the work and trophies Antonio Conte provided, there was a realisation – even before their victory in the FA Cup final – that his position had become untenable. Conte had lost the dressing room after a series of disagreements with the playing staff and Sarri had been identified as his successor some time ago.Sarri’s appointment represents a real departure from Conte’s more reactive approach and Chelsea fans can expect to see sweeping changes in playing style and formation – if not personnel. The delay in bringing in their man has hampered his chances of imparting his philosophy before the season begins, though the signing of former Napoli midfielder Jorginho will be a key step in that direction.A switch to a 4-3-3 formation is in the offing, which will mean deserting the three-man defence that helped Chelsea win the league title under Conte. It remains to be seen how well the players will suit the new shape. Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso were ideal wing-backs in the old system, while Cesar Azpilicueta adapted to the role of a right-sided centre-back superbly, becoming the team’s most consistent performer. The Spaniard may revert to his old right-back position but that would strip the side of their most reliable centre-half.It’s little surprise that Sarri is shopping for an upgrade in central defence, then. His net has been cast almost exclusively in his homeland and even more specifically than that if Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is to be believed. The club’s outspoken owner says Sarri wanted to “take my whole team to England and dismantle it” and that he had to “lay down the law” to Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia after approaches for a number of Napoli players.Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly was a target for Chelsea but De Laurentiis says he has rejected “a €100m bid from the Premier League”. Both Leonardo Bonucci of Milan and Daniele Rugani of Juventus are on Sarri’s wishlist as he looks for a defender who can play out from the back.Napoli passed teams to death at times last season. Their average of 676 short passes per game was second only to Manchester City (699) last season in Europe’s top five leagues. They would work opponents with a long period of possession before springing into incisive, often one-touch passing moves. This approach requires the right midfield. Jorginho will sit as the fulcrum of the side, meaning that N’Golo Kanté will probably take a No6 role, which could give him slightly more freedom to join attacking moves as he did so successfully at Leicester. Fitting the newly crowned World Cup winner into the side will be easy, but Tiemoue Bakayoko is probably too wasteful for Sarri’s liking.Cesc Fàbregas may need to adapt his game to find a place in the side. He is very similar to Jorginho, so may be pushed into an advanced, creative role in the midfield three – if he has the legs for the job. Ross Barkley will be hoping to make that position his own as he attempts to relaunch his career at domestic and international level.If reports are to be believed, both Fabregas and Barkley could be competing with Sergej Milinković-Savić for the goalscoring midfielder role Marek Hamsik played so well for Napoli under Sarri. Milinković-Savić scored 12 goals from the left of a midfield three at Lazio last season. A triumvirate of Jorginho, Kanté and Milinkovic-Savic would give Sarri a true blend of physicality and creativity.Elsewhere, the club may need to replace goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois should he leave for Real Madrid. Eden Hazard and Willian have also been linked with moves to Spain, even though both forwards would fit into Sarri’s favoured front three formation very naturally. There could even be opportunities to experiment with Hazard’s position. His Belgium team-mate Dries Mertens excelled under Sarri at Napoli when he moved into a central role, something that might also suit Hazard.That said, Sarri’s set-up still requires a striker, with Álvaro Morata struggling for form and Olivier Grioud already being touted as a departure. Gonzalo Higuaín would fit the bill, especially after Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo. Higuaín enjoyed remarkable success under Sarri in Naples. They had just one season together at the Stadio San Paolo but Higuaín was unstoppable in that 2015-16 campaign, breaking the Serie A goalscoring record with 36 goals in 35 appearances. A move to Turin followed and, despite scoring 40 goals in his two seasons with the Italian champions, another move would make sense for both clubs and the player.If Sarri were to bring in Higuaín and complete his puzzle, Chelsea could be a real force this season. Things are going to be very different at the Bridge and fans are understandably excited about the new direction. They will not be distracted by the lure of potential Champions League glory, which will give Sarri more time to concentrate on bouncing back in the league.It seems managing Chelsea is an Italian job nowadays. Their last three coaches from the peninsula have lifted major trophies in their first seasons – Carlo Ancelotti’s double in 2009-10, Roberto Di Matteo’s triumph in the Champions League in 2012, and Conte’s league title last May.Sarri offers the prospect of a brand of football the fans have not seen at Stamford Bridge, but his legacy will be judged on silverware and even that doesn’t offer job security at Chelsea. Combine the attacking football the board have craved for many years with trophies and Sarri could yet become the manager who leaves on his own terms.• Follow WhoScored on Twitter and Facebook• Follow Martin Laurence on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55001c79e0ba04ed70d0a05c977c41b5f252991b/0_203_4083_2449/master/4083.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c5608b63ef34a2ddc620af0708bb44f","title":"best vegan vegetarian recipes yotam ottolenghi nigel slater pies pasta salads","story":"From Simon Hopkinson’s caponata to Nigel Slater’s bucatini with spinach – our pick of the vegan and vegetarian recipes you’ll go back to time and againFor Luise and me, this recipe is all about building our own Mexican-inspired tortilla bowl, but for the kids it’s just another reason to eat with their hands.We usually keep the ingredients in the bowls on the table quite simple and fresh a mashed avocado bowl, herb bowl, bean bowl, greens and yogurt.

While the leaves are still wet, cook them for a minute or two in a pan with a tight lid, so they soften in their own steam. If you are worried about them sticking, add a tablespoon or two of water. As soon as the spinach has wilted, plunge it into a bowl of iced water to stop it cooking, squeeze it dry with your hands, then roughly chop it. Bring a pan of water to the boil then add 125g sugar snap peas, let them cook for 2 minutes then remove and drain them.Bring a large pan of water to the boil, salt it, then cook 200g bucatini or other thin pasta for about 9 minutes till just tender, and drain.Cut 1 large courgette into thick slices and then into quarters. Melt 30g butter in a shallow pan then add 2 tbsp olive oil. Fry the courgette for 3 or 4 minutes until it starts to colour, then add the spinach leaves and the cooked sugar snaps. Roughly chop a small bunch of parsley and add it to the vegetables.Pour 25ml double cream into the vegetables and combine it gently. Let it simmer for a minute then pour it over the drained pasta and toss together gently. Garnish with lemon and pass round a bowl of grated vegetarian Italian hard cheese.

Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and gently knead for 1 minute, adding a little flour if needed, until soft and malleable. Wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.Place a large lidded sauté pan on medium–high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil and, once hot, add the curry powder, caraway seeds, mustard seeds and cardamom. Cook for just a few seconds, stirring and making sure the spices don’t burn, before adding the onion, chilli and thyme. Cook for another 4 minutes, add the garlic and cook for another minute, stirring. Add the potato, carrot and parsnip, stir and then pour in the stock. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Add the squash, sugar, ¾ teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper, and continue to simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the vegetables are cooked through and most of the liquid has evaporated: you should have about 3 tablespoons of liquid left add a little water if needed. Uncover, remove from the heat and set aside to cool totally before stirring in the cheese and coriander.Preheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6.Use the remaining oil to brush the sides and bases of an extra-large 6-hole muffin tin (each hole should be 6cm wide and 4cm deep). Line the bases with circles of baking parchment and place the tin in the fridge. Roll out the pastry 2–3mm thick, cut out 6 circles, 14cm in diameter, and press down into the tin. Trim the edges, reusing the spare pastry to roll out for a second time. Cut out 6 more circles, 8cm in diameter – these will form lids.Fill each pie with about 120g of filling, brush the rims with egg and place the lids on top. Pinch the edges together securely, brush the lids with the remaining egg and prick each pie with a fork in a few places. Allow to rest in the fridge for 10 minutes. Place in the oven and bake for 30–35 minutes, until golden-brown.

How did it become a $30bn business?The omega-3 industry is in a twist. Again. Last week, Cochrane, an organisation that compiles and evaluates medical research for the general public, released a meta-analysis – a study of studies – to determine whether or not omega-3 pills, one of the world’s most popular dietary supplements, reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. After comparing 79 trials involving 112,059 people, the researchers could find “little or no difference to risk of cardiovascular events, coronary heart deaths, coronary heart disease events, stroke or heart irregularities”.I can’t say that I was particularly surprised. Over the past 15 years, more than 20 studies have shown a similar lack of effect. But what does surprise me is how we continue to look at the world of fish and seafood through the amber lens of a fish oil capsule. Omega-3s do something in our bodies – and probably something important. But without the larger context of the marine organisms that contain them, omega-3s get lost in the noise of human metabolism and modern marketing.The confusion arises in part from the historical baggage of fish oil and the $30bn (£23bn) industry associated with omega-3 extraction. Once upon a time, fish oil solved a major human health problem. But it had nothing to do with coronary heart disease. During the Industrial Revolution, a disease became increasingly prevalent throughout northern Europe: rickets. Malnourished children in sunlight-poor urban slums often ended up bowlegged by adolescence. Researchers eventually pieced the puzzle together and concluded that the disease was caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, which the body naturally generates in the presence of sunlight. And, as it turned out, vitamin D is stored in high amounts within the liver of codfish.A Norwegian pharmacist named Peter Möller seized upon this finding (and many other anecdotal stories about the curative properties of cod-liver oil). Using a patented chemical process, he arrived at a product that, he announced to the world, “didn’t taste fishy”. Möller and his advertising team then launched a campaign to institutionalise the regular use of cod-liver oil, regardless of whether you were at risk of rickets or not. The campaign was a success: a spoonful a day became common practice. Möller built his company into an international presence and died in 1869 with 70 cod-liver oil steam factories to his name, churning out 5,000 barrels of the stuff a year. By the time omega-3s started to be a focus of medical research, there was already a rosy feeling around fish oil.In the early 1970s, the chemist Hans Olaf Bang read in a Danish journal that there were extremely low incidences of cardiovascular disease in Inuit communities of Greenland. He and his assistant, Jørn Dyerberg, travelled to Uummannaq on the north-west coast of Greenland to investigate. At the time of the expedition, Bang didn’t quite know what he wanted to test for. They probed and palpated 130 local people, measured height and weight, and came home with a lot of blood.“We had these 130 precious samples of blood,” Dyerberg told me in his lab in Copenhagen recently. They estimated that in 20 years, the traditional Inuit diet would have changed to the western diet, and Dyerberg remembers Bang saying: “‘There will never be anyone who can do this again, so let’s do whatever we can!’ And we decided to do fatty acid analysis.”The result of their analysis was a hypothesis that is an exemplary “association study”. In an association study, multiple factors are logged and a hypothesis of correlation is drawn from the findings. In the case of the Bang and Dyerberg Inuit study, they found that: 1) Inuit people in Greenland had a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids and blood lipid levels of omega-3s much higher than their western contemporaries. 2) Inuit people also had, according to public health records, markedly lower rates of coronary heart disease. They hypothesised that therefore 3) omega-3s might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.This was backed up by further laboratory studies that did show, in vitro, that omega-3s were involved in anti-inflammatory reactions. But – and this is a big but – while correlations abound for omega-3s and heart disease, the real trouble has always been in showing causation. That is where this latest round of studies comes in.The Cochrane study and the others that preceded it have one thing in common: they are meta-analyses of “randomised control trials” (RCTs). That is, trials where patients are given a supplement at random and tracked over time against another set of patients given a placebo. Most statisticians consider these trials to be the very top of the evidence pyramid. But it is these studies that have at times proven troublesome for Omega World. Each time RCTs come to light that show little or no effect, Omega World tends to blend its counterargument with evidence from association studies because, as a recent industry reply to the Cochrane report put it, “it’s all connected”.When it then turns to the RCTs, the industry, as would be expected, looks for different explanations as to why positive health outcomes weren’t reported. In the burst of RCTs preceding Cochrane, the Omega World line was that these most recent trials did not show benefits because things such as statins, stents and other forms of cardiovascular intervention masked the anti-inflammatory effect of fish oil pills earlier RCTs had shown a fairly significant effect, but none of those treatments existed at the time of those trials.The industry also, and I believe rightly, pointed out that studies often failed to look at omega-3 blood lipid levels before and after supplementation. In other words, it’s not really a fair trial if you don’t know where the patients started with respect to the omega-3 levels in their blood. If we only measure effect without looking at omega-3 levels in the blood at the outset, aren’t we doing the dietary equivalent of testing how far a car can drive without checking how much petrol is in the tank at the start?With Cochrane, the latest industry argument is that the study’s authors cut out a number of different forms of cardiac ailments, thus skewing the stats. In particular, it notes that Cochrane failed to include “sudden cardiac death” and “sudden cardiac mortality” in its list of outcomes. Since nearly half of all patients first report heart disease to their doctors by suddenly dropping dead, this is not an insignificant exclusion.But the fact that the industry’s arguments shift with each new, damning meta-analysis gives you pause. What is going on? Is there an international conspiracy to discredit omega-3s? Or does Omega World keep moving the goalposts? When I posed this question to Ellen Schutt, the executive director of the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, probably the world’s most prominent omega-3 advocacy organisation, she made it seem as if the problem didn’t even exist. “As a matter of fact, we track media sentiment … and have found many more positive omega-3 stories than negative, in general. Of course, the negative stories are the ones that catch people’s attention. As we both know, negative stories are much more interesting and the media is definitely guilty of sensationalist ‘clickbait’ headlines such as: ‘Omega-3s don’t work.’”As sympathetic as I am to the trials of Omega World, as studies continue to poke holes in aspects of the omega-3 cardiovascular argument, I can’t help thinking there is something else going on. Because, while the fish oil supplement business is a big deal, it is also a sheen on the surface of a much deeper pond. Long before omega-3 supplements became popular, an industry arose that used the same omega-3-rich creatures not for medicine, but for an odd array of agricultural and industrial purposes.Ultimately, it was this so-called “reduction industry” that created the oily-fish extraction system that now consumes millions of tonnes of marine wildlife every year. Today, one in every four kilograms of fish caught is reduced into oil and meal and used for agriculture, land animal husbandry and, most recently, fish farming, AKA aquaculture. The reduction industry has appeared in different forms under different ownership over centuries of human history. In the 18th century, it targeted whales, reducing northern hemisphere cetacean populations into isolated pockets of endangered species in order to make lamp oil and lubricants. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it shifted to the southern hemisphere, reducing 390,000 of the 400,000 great whales that once roamed the Southern Ocean to margarine, nitroglycerine and other “marine ingredients”.Each decade brings a different use for all those anchovies. In the 1940s, they were used for fertiliser. In the 50s and 60s, chicken feed. In the 70s, pet food and pig feed. In the 80s and 90s, aquafeed for salmon and other carnivorous fish. And now, the most elite product of the reduction industry: dietary supplements.And it is not just Peruvian anchoveta that are reduced into fish meal and oil. All told, the reduction industry removes from the ocean 20m-25m tonnes annually – the equivalent of the combined weight of the population of the United States. The omega-3 industry argues that some vendors are turning to much more sustainable options, such as algae-based omega-3s and fish oil reclaimed from recycled byproducts.Nevertheless, the reduction industry marches on into new territory. Most recently, it has begun targeting Antarctic krill, the keystone prey species of the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Two years ago, when I asked the then chief executive of the largest krill extractor in the world why it had launched a $200m fishing operation in the Southern Ocean to take food out of the mouths of whales, he noted that krill oil is a “phospholipid” and making it much more “bioavailable” means that consumers can take a much smaller pill. Why was this important? Consumers who chose krill oil over fish oil would be much less likely to suffer the horrors of a fishy burp.Amid all the conflicting reports, there is one bit of data that shines out: fish and seafood can bring considerable health and environmental benefits. Fish, in addition to providing us with omega-3s, delivers protein with far fewer calories than meat: 100g of salmon contains 139 calories and 23g of protein. By comparison, 100g of beef contains 210 calories and 20g of protein.Harvesting wild fish from well-managed stocks requires a fraction of the carbon as farming terrestrial livestock. Similarly, fish farming puts a lesser burden on the Earth in terms of carbon and freshwater use than pretty much any form of terrestrial animal husbandry. We could make the farming of fish even more carbon- and resource-efficient if we used alternative ingredients for fish food based on algae and food waste. And if you consider growing “filter feeders” such as mussels, clams and oysters, the benefits are even more extreme. These bivalves don’t have to be fed anything, and make water cleaner even as they grow fatter. They provide protein 30 times more efficiently than cattle.Is the epidemiological evidence for fish-eating better than simply taking a fish oil pill? Again, we are stuck with the problem of correlation versus causation. It is very difficult to feed someone a fish in such a manner that they don’t know they are eating a fish. Hence an RCT of seafood-eating hasn’t really ever been done. Most of the studies around seafood are association studies. And, while one such study associated eating fish twice a week with a possible reduction in mortality of 55,000 lives a year, we don’t know what a fish-eater does with the rest of their life beyond eating fish.But what we do know is this: the omega-3 industry and the reduction industry that bred it removes fish from the water in a way that doesn’t put protein on our plates – it just puts pills in our cupboards. Is this the way we want to continue to do business with the planet?• The subheading of this article was amended on 25 July 2018 to clarify that it was for heart health or strokes that the study found omega-3 had little or no benefit.

Traditionally, they’re poached, rather than baked, though the same rules apply: add the sugar to the egg whites before whisking, as Michel Roux Jr’s book The French Kitchen suggests, and the resulting foam will be dense and firm fold it in at the end, as Koffmann recommends in his book Classic Koffmann, and it’ll be softer, but hard to work with. Best, I find, to beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks, as Anthony Bourdain’s recipe in Les Halles Cookbook dictates, then gradually beat in the sugar a little at a time, to give a firm, yet light result. Caster sugar dissolves more easily than David Tanis’ granulated variety in the New York Times, though, making the finished meringues less inclined to weep moisture as they cool. Tanis also stabilises his meringue mix with cream of tartar, which feels like wise insurance even if you’re not using coarse sugar, especially if you’re not sure of the age of your eggs (older eggs whip up better, because the protein networks are looser and more amenable to the addition of large amounts of air).They can’t compete with the poached sort for lightness, though – and, really, it’s not a hard technique to master. First, I’d strongly recommend not trying to cook too many at once: these fragile icebergs have a wide turning circle, and an annoying tendency to stick together in the pan if they come into contact with each other. A wide pan is preferable to a tall, narrow saucepan for the same reason. I try covering the pan to avoid the need to turn them in the first place, as in Tanis’s recipe, but though this technique yields excellent early results, they rapidly deflate as soon as I lift the lid a cautious flip proves more successful.Second, and even more important, these are not Ottolenghi-style, billowing beauties, but foamy little quenelles of featherlight pleasure – they will deflate as they cool, for the same reason a soufflé or yorkshire pudding will, but bear in mind this is a homely pudding designed to taste, rather than look impressive (though, frankly, to these British eyes, it still does).Many recipes poach the meringues in milk, then thriftily reuse it in the custard. My problem with this is that, while I don’t think it makes a discernible difference to the finished meringues, it does mean you have to make them before the custard, even though that takes far longer to cool down, and with a dessert this sweet, you really do want it cold, rather than just cool. Simmering milk also has a tendency to form a skin as soon as you take your eye off the pan, which then clings to the meringues – water, by contrast, does not.I feel on safer ground here: custard in its various preparations would be a strong contender for my specialist subject if Mastermind ever came calling. This is a very French version: elegantly thin (though, as Koffmann cautions, it must be viscous enough to support the meringue) and ridiculously rich, with enough sugar to put you off eating more than your fair share.Berry’s version, the least sweet of the lot and the only one to rely on the thickening power of a little cornflour, is my favourite, though I concede you don’t strictly need the cornflour unless you’re feeling nervous the same goes for Tanis’s bain marie. I do like his cardamom and lemon peel-infused milk, however, even if vanilla is de rigueur in the classic preparation – and if you’re feeling particularly decadent, you might want to cut the milk with a little single cream to make a British equivalent of his suggested “half and half”.Though you shouldn’t need to strain your creme anglaise unless you’re worried the Michelin inspectors are in town, I do highly recommend plonking the finished custard in a sink of cold or iced water to ensure it’s refreshingly cool – David Lebovitz even chills his bowls before serving. (Berry butters hers, though I can’t for the life of me work out why.)Roux makes a strawberry compote to go with his îles flottantes, and Tanis poaches cherries in a rose syrup, both of which are utterly delicious with yoghurt, but rather too sweet for our taste when paired with the meringue and custard. If you’d like some fruit in the bowl, I think some baked rhubarb would go very nicely – l’entente cordiale in dessert form.Nuts are a common garnish, and Koffmann goes one step further with pink praline almonds, which “bring a nice crunch and the colour looks pretty”, but they’re hard to get hold of in this country – and, again, very sweet. His suggested alternative of pistachios or toasted almonds, also used by Berry and Bourdain, prove more popular, adding crunch without extra sugar – unlike the caramel that’s widely used in restaurants. If you’re a sugar fiend, though, it’s very easy to add – once you’ve portioned out the puddings, heat 150g sugar in a pan until a rich brown, then drizzle over the top. Repent at leisure.4 eggs500ml whole milk1 vanilla pod, split, or a dash of vanilla extract120g caster sugar1 tsp cornflour (optional)¼ tsp cream of tartar1 pinch salt2 tbsp flaked almondsSeparate the eggs, putting the yolks into a medium heatproof bowl and the whites into a large, scrupulously clean one. Set this aside while you make the custard.Pour the milk into a medium saucepan and add the vanilla. Bring to a simmer, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 10 minutes. Bring back to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk 40g sugar with the egg yolks and cornflour, if using, until dissolved. Put the bowl on a damp kitchen towel near the hob (this helps anchor it) and half-fill the sink with cold water.Remove the vanilla pod, if using (give it a quick rinse, dry well and use to perfume a jar of sugar). Pour half the simmering milk over the yolks, whisking all the time, until well combined, then pour back into the milk pan. Cook over a low heat, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon – when you draw your finger down the spoon, it should leave a clear line. Take off the heat. Pour the custard back into the bowl and put it in the sink to cool, stirring occasionally.To make the meringues, add the cream of tartar and a pinch of salt to the egg whites, then beat to soft peaks. Gradually add the sugar, still beating, until it’s all incorporated, then carry on beating until the mix is shiny and stiff.Bring a wide, shallow pan of water to a boil and line a baking tray with kitchen paper. Scoop a generous amount of meringue mixture on to a dessert spoon, then push off into the water with a second spoon to make a kind of egg shape. Do this until the pan is a third full, poach for two minutes, then very carefully flip over and poach for two minutes more. Gently scoop out with a slotted spoon and slide on to the tray. Repeat with the remaining mixture, then leave to cool. Toast the almonds in a dry pan until golden.To serve, ide the custard between bowls, top with two meringues apiece, scatter the almonds on top and eat while they’re still nice and cool.• Îles flottantes or oeufs à la neige: do they bring back happy holiday memories, or do you prefer creme brulee or custard tart?

He said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he had listened to Hodge being interviewed on Monday, adding: “I realised there was a complete misinterpretation of the code, so I can understand why she was so angry if that’s what she believed this code had done.”Hodge, who is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust, has said she stands by her comments, though she denies swearing at Corbyn in an angry confrontation in a Commons corridor last week after Labour’s national executive committee refused to abandon its new code of conduct on antisemitism.The code includes the internationally accepted International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, but does not replicate in full a list of examples of antisemitism published by the IHRA alongside its definition.McDonnell said that both Hodge and Corbyn had been upset by the incident.“Jeremy was deeply upset because, when you have someone haranguing you in that way, of course it’s upsetting,” he added. “Those sorts of accusations, when he has worked so hard on the issues of antisemitism and anti-racism, of course he’s upset.” Labour’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, has written to Hodge telling her she faces investigation for “abusive conduct” and that “any further behaviour of a similar nature” could result in disciplinary action.McDonnell said Corbyn agreed that the case should be settled swiftly rather than subjected to the full disciplinary process.“At the weekend I spoke to Jeremy and said we’ve got to resolve this matter quickly,” said McDonnell. “He said, yes, we’ve got to do that, and he’s asked the chief whip and general secretary to try to sort this out. We want it resolved amicably and I think that can be done.”Labour averted a  showdown with MPs over its code of conduct on Monday, with a vote on whether the party should adopt the international antisemitism definition deferred until parliament returns in September.At the PLP meeting, sources said a number of Labour MPs spoke strongly in favour of adopting the IHRA definition, with an objection raised by the former deputy prime minister John Prescott."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b86e22983bec0fde5f8b1e9632f0e0cce5d9b8/0_558_5232_3138/master/5232.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=626c636ab8010637bd24ecb985811662","title":"brexit uk cannot afford not to have a deal says irish government politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenWe have some new ICM polling out today, covering perceptions of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, as well as voting intention.We’ve been regularly asking people whether they trust Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn most to do the best job on key issues.

And here are the main points from this round of results.Here is ICM’s Alex Turk on the findings (his bold text).And here are the figures.And here are the voting intention figures, compared with ICM two weeks ago.I will post a link to the tables here when they go up on the ICM website.ICM Unlimited interviewed a representative online sample of 2,010 adults aged 18+, between 20 and 22 July 2018. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults. ICM is a member of the British Polling Council and abides by its rules.The Nia Griffith quote criticising Labour’s decision to launch a disciplinary inquiry into Margaret Hodge comes from an interview she has given to Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast. Here a section from the BBC transcript.NG: Look Margaret quite clearly has had some appalling times herself in terms of prejudice against her and a massive challenge with the BNP to deal with, so if she wants to have a very clear word with Jeremy that’s entirely up to her.Nick: Should she be disciplined?NG: The idea that Jeremy would want to set up an atmosphere in the party where people couldn’t go and say things to him is completely absurd. It’s just not his way of dealing things. I think we’d all prefer to have somebody speak to your face rather than behind your back. It’s important that we have those discussions and if it means we need to do a lot more work to get things right let’s do it.Nick: But do you mean that there won’t be disciplinary proceedings against Margaret Hodge or you think Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t want there to be, which is a bit different?NG: Well at the moment I’m not aware of any processes by which because somebody speaks to somebody else ‘in a particular way’ we’ve had disciplinary procedures. Normally if we’re speaking about policy, if we’re talking about issues we can have those discussions.Nick: Journalists have been told that she crossed a line, that should be disciplinary proceedings. If there were, how would you feel belonging to a party that disciplined Margaret Hodge, who’s worried about antisemitism, but never quite got round to disciplining Ken Livingstone?NG: Well I just can’t see a situation where we discipline people for speaking their minds to each other, whether its members of the shadow cabinet or the leader of the opposition himself.Hodge was informed on Wednesday last week that she was being investigated. She received a letter to that effect from Jennie Formby, the party’s general secretary, which said that allegations that Hodge had broken party rules had been reported to the party, but which did not say by whom.On the same day Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman told journalists at a briefing that action would be taken against Hodge.In an interview on the Today programme this morning John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said that he did not know who had initially complained about Hodge, only that only that “a range of complaints came in”.Nia Griffith, the shadow defence minister, has criticised Labour’s decision to launch a disciplinary inquiry into Margaret Hodge for calling Jeremy Corbyn antisemitic, PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield reports.The centre right thinktank Policy Exchange has published a report today saying the law on treason should be updated so that it can be applied to jihadis. The Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat is one of the co-authors of the report, and here is a summary of what it says.Parliament should enact a new offence which would revive the law of treason and recognise that betrayal – treason – is a clear moral wrong.This would specify that it is an offence to aid a state or organisation that is attacking the UK or preparing to attack the UK or against which UK forces are engaged in armed conflict.This should apply to the actions of anyone in the UK it should also apply to the actions of British citizens or settled non-citizens anywhere in the world.In most cases, people convicted of treason should be sentenced to life imprisonment, a sentence which reflects the gravity of the wrong of betrayal, deters others, and incapacitates the offender.At a minimum, parliament should reform our law to follow Australia and New Zealand and thus make it clear that it is unlawful to aid the enemy either in an international armed conflict or in a non-international armed conflict.But the Conservative MEP David Campbell Bannerman (originally a Ukip MEP, but he defected in 2011) thinks this does not go far enough. He says a new treason law should also cover those “actively working undemocratically” against the UK “through extreme EU loyalty”.I’ve called CCHQ to ask if the party approves. I’ve been told they will get back to me.It is appropriate that Campbell Bannerman has tweeted an image of a  splash. Two weeks ago the paper tweeted this, a link to an article about the large number of letters the paper was getting from readers unhappy about Theresa May’s Chequers plan, some of whom were accusing her of treason. The tweet was widely criticised as irresponsible, on the grounds that inflammatory comments of this sort contribute to a climate in which it has become routine for MPs to face death threats, or worse.Turning back to the issue of a no deal Brexit for a moment, this Newsnight clip is interesting. For a long time Brexiters have been arguing that the government should be spending much more time and money preparing for a no deal Brexit they argued that, unless the UK could show that it was in a position to walk away from the talks and manage without a deal, it would inevitably have to accept whatever the EU offered.But, according to Newsnight’s political editor Nick Watt, some Brexiters are now complaining that talk about stockpiling food etc amounts to “project fear” - in other words, a scaremongering exercise intended to frighten people off the no deal option.John McDonnell was also on the Today programme this morning. As my colleague Ben Quinn reports, in that interview McDonnell called for a swift and amicable resolution to disciplinary measures taken against Margaret Hodge for accusing Jeremy Corbyn of racism and antisemitism.In the interview McDonnell said that Hodge had criticised Corbyn because she did not understand the full scope of the new Labour code of conduct on antisemitism. She thought it did not cover some types of antisemitism that it does cover, he argued.I went into this issue in some detail on Monday if you want to read more on what the code actually covers.Q: In the Commons yesterday Amber Rudd, the Hastings MP and Tory former home secretary, complained that you had visited her constituency without letting her know in advance (a courtesy MPs are supposed to observe).McDonnell says that was a mistake. He has a new diary secretary. He has written to Rudd about it, he says.Q: Would you welcome MPs leaving Labour and forming a new centrist party?No, of course not, says McDonnell. He says MPs like Chuka Umunna and Wes Streeting make a good contribution.He says having a debate leads to better policies being generated.You mustn’t mistake democracy for ision.On the key issues, the party votes together and campaigns together, he says.Q: When you look at Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn’s favourability scores, May’s have not changed much since the election. But Corbyn’s have fallen a lot. He is now just above the PM.Just above the PM, McDonnell says. He laughs, as if the point has been made.He says Labour shot up in the polls during the election campaign because the party got balanced coverage. The same thing will happen again, he says.He says he is doing a lot of regional engagement conferences. Some of these are targeted at particular towns. He will go to a town, like Hastings, and look at the policies they need.Q: How do you feel about John Woodcock leaving Labour?McDonnells says: “It’s a shame ... I like John.”He says he respects Woodcock’s views.Labour is a broad church. It is better like that, he says. So it is “disappointing” that Woodcock has gone. But these things happen, he says.McDonnell says, if the government cannot deliver a Brexit deal, they should move over and let Labour take over.If they won’t do that, they should have a general election, he says.Q: You are preparing for a general election. How likely do you think it is that there will be an election before Brexit?McDonnell says it is impossible to tell. Until recently he was pretty pessimistic about the possibility of an election happening. Now he is not so sure. That is why Labour needs to be ready.He says the party is focusing on the policies it wants to pass, and preparing implementation manuals showing how the legislation will be passed.Q: But four of your MPs supported the government in a key vote last week.McDonnell said he went to speak to those MPs before the vote. They argued that the government was going to fall in the autumn anyway.Q: Will any action be taken?McDonnell says he is not sure. Usually the chief whip calls people in.He says he is going to keep talking to these four, saying the more they prop up the government, the harder they make it for Labour to take over.He says he respects their views. He just thinks they are making a mistake.Q: Jeremy Corbyn’s speech yesterday has been criticised. It has been said that protectionism isn’t the way forward.McDonnell says Corbyn was not proposing protectionism. He was talking about using procurement to support British manufacturing jobs. Those workers then pay taxes, so the government benefits.Q: Corbyn talked about a foreign firm winning the bid to print new passports. But its bid was lower, so the taxpayer benefits surely?But a third of that money comes back to the government through taxation, he says. And you keep people in jobs so you don’t have to pay people benefits. And that strategy also means the UK maintains manufacturing skills.He says he does not see why the UK is buying ships from abroad. That undermines the shipbuilding industry here, he says.Radio 5 Live is now playing its interview with John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. Anna Foster interviewed him earlier, and they are broadcasting it now.Q: What did you think of the pay rises for public sector workers announced yesterday?McDonnell says he went into parliament yesterday expecting to welcome the news. But, after looking at the figures, he thinks people will conclude it was all spin.He cites the Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis. Most teachers will not be getting a pay rise above inflation, he says. He says his eldest daughter is a teacher.He says the money will have to come from within departments’ budgets. In education, that means money for schools will be raided, he says.Q: Don’t voters like to know that public sector workers are getting a pay rise, without taxes having to go up?McDonnell says there will have to be another round of cuts to pay for these pay rises. With the police, there will have to be another round of job losses, he says.Here are the main points from Simon Coveney’s interview on the Today programme.I welcomed the Chequers plan as a step forward. I think it’s the basis for negotiation ... I think it’s a step forward that the white paper now exists.There are elements of that that will be difficult to negotiate because, of course, the EU wants to protect the integrity of the single market for all of the other member states of the European Union and, of course, protect the integrity of the customs union. I think it will be difficult to separate goods and services. If you look at a car, for example, today, a large part of that is services, as well as the physical components which are good.It shall be unlawful for Her Majesty‘s government to enter into arrangements under which Northern Ireland forms part of a separate customs territory to Great Britain.But Coveney dismissed the argument that NC37 sabotages the backstop plan, effectively implying that the UK government might have to abandon the amendment. Asked about this, he said:Whatever final agreement is made in negotiation between the EU and the UK is going to have to be accommodated in new legislation. You can’t have negotiation on the basis of passing laws in your parliament, or introducing amendments in your parliament, and then saying, ‘Well, sorry, we have no flexibility now because this law has been passed in parliament.’ The EU could decide to do that as well, and we’d get nowhere.Absolutely. If Britain asks for more time, and if that is necessary to get to a sensible agreement, then we would support that, of course we would.A lot of people might not think it listening to me, but, actually, Ireland is one of Britain’s big allies in these negotiations. We are a country that is going to stay as part of the European Union, and that is very important to us, but our relationship with Britain is also hugely important.This will surprise some Brexiters, who have been bitterly critical of Ireland’s stance in the Brexit talks. Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, in particular has become a Brexiter bête noire.Quite early in the Brexit process Theresa May declared that no deal would be better than a bad deal. Critics in the UK said she was wrong (on the grounds that no deal would be a very bad deal indeed), this rhetoric was deemed unhelpful in Brussels, and for a while the government toned down the no deal talk. But last week May announced the government would be publishing around 70 papers with information about no deal planning and yesterday, at two separate select committees, Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, revealed that the government was considering how to guarantee food and medical supplies in the event of a no deal Brexit.But this morning Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, implied that talk of the UK being able to walk way from the talks without a deal was a bluff. Britain could not afford not to have a deal, he told the Today programme.I will post more from the interview shortly.Parliament is in recess now and so at Westminster it is relatively quiet. Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: The Office for National Statistics publishes figures on first-time buyer affordability.9.30am: The Independent Office for Police Conduct publishes annual statistics on deaths during or following police contact.10am: David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, chairs a meeting of the British-Irish intergovernmental conference. Afterward, at 12pm, Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, and Charles Flanagan, the Irish justice minister, will hold a press briefing.10am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is interviewed on Radio 5 Live.2.30pm: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech in Washington.We’ve also got some ICM polling that I will be posting later.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

But why is this stage, the 17th in the 2018 Tour, so different to the usual Alpine and Pyrenean stages?First is the distance. This very fast route, the shortest in the Tour’s modern era, has been likened by some in the race convoy to a “team time trial” or a “criterium in the mountains”. Criteriums are the city centre circuit races ridden throughout France, usually at high speeds and with no quarter given.The difference here is the terrain, which includes a start line at the foot of the steep climb to the Col de Peyresourde. Second is the absence of any neutralised zone, or rolling start. This means the riders will race from the start line, unlike in all other races when there is a départ fictif, or false start, and a few kilometres of neutralised riding before the flag is dropped at the départ réel – the real start.Third is the F1-style grid, sited at the foot of the first climb, in which the yellow jersey will start in pole position and the 19 closest-placed riders on the overall standings will line up in order behind him. The rest of the peloton will be held in pens, cyclocross-style, and then start after the 20 riders at the head of the standings.But most teams, while welcoming the initiative, don’t see it as radically changing the way the stage is raced. “This is going to be a very, very fast stage,” the Team Sky sports director, Nicolas Portal, said. “That’s as much because of the distance as anything. We may ride an hour in the morning and then do a very long warm-up before the stage.”“Some will need a longer warm-up than others,” Adam Yates’s sports director, Matt White, said. “Half the peloton will hate the start tomorrow, especially most blokes over 65kg. It’s a really hard start for the non-climbers.“Everybody will be on the home trainer, as usual for these hill starts,” White said. “If you’d told me 10 years ago that we’d see professionals on the home trainer before the start of every Tour stage, I would have laughed.“We never had stages like this before and I think it’s a great idea. They’re trying some new ideas and I think it’s good to mix it up. The sport’s changing.”Tom Southam, of the Education First team, expected attacks from the main contenders from the start. “I think this stage will be decided pretty quickly,” he said. “It will be like a team time-trial. With Rigoberto Urán gone, we have no overall contender. So our only hopes are breakaways, but given the nature of this stage, there’s no hope of that at all.”“I don’t think it’ll change things very much,” Vincenzo Nibali’s coach, Paolo Slongo said of the grid start innovation, “but if a leader attacked and had some teammates near them, then they could have some kind of advantage. Team Sky will no doubt have a strong team and could therefore gain a benefit.”Team Sky will have two riders in the first 20, Geraint Thomas and Chris Froome, while the Movistar team have three, Mikel Landa, Nairo Quintana and Alejandro Valverde, and the Lotto Jumbo NL team, two – Primoz Roglic and Steven Kruisjwijk.That weight of numbers may see a very volatile opening to the stage and a select group of contenders move clear. If that is the case, then the stage, and perhaps the Tour itself, could be played out on the steep slopes of the final ascent of this stage, the Col du Portet, which climbs to 2,215 metres."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75edae67209a9e80daa259256afd6b291a0a00b3/0_28_4497_2699/master/4497.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4fb03f07a42e448bd074b6816c56620","title":"sebastian vettel mistakes adding up missed championship","story":"Ferrari’s No 1 driver knows he is under scrutiny after missing out at Hockenheim as last two years show a worrying trendSebastian Vettel said he is at “peace with himself” despite the baying hounds of the Italian media turning on him after his mistake at the German Grand Prix cost Ferrari a win. For this intelligent and grounded driver it is a familiar mantra he has employed previously. Indeed, it was a response that was entirely expected which suggests he is having to use it too often. In a tenacious battle for the world championship with Lewis Hamilton, it appears to be that in moments of pressure, Vettel has been found wanting.Taking a pounding in the press of Ferrari’s home nation comes with the territory in a red car. But it was that Vettel’s crash in the wet at Hockenheim while leading was self-inflicted, that seemed so exasperating.“His mistake is devastating and could be why Ferrari loses the world championship,” La Gazzetta dello Sport forebodingly wrote. La Stampa said: “The German has made at least four mistakes in 11 races. The talent of the world champion is not questioned, but his exaggerated zest is hurting Ferrari’s season.”Four mistakes this season would include his grid penalty for impeding Carlos Sainz in qualifying at the Red Bull Ring and some have cited the clash with Max Verstappen in China, which is unfair. Having given the Dutchman room, he was not to blame when Verstappen clouted him.He has, however, made five high-profile mistakes in just over 12 months and all were misjudgments at moments of great intensity.In June last year with Hamilton leading in Baku, the red mist descended when, believing he had been brake-tested, he barged into his car. A 10-second stop-go penalty ensued and it would have been costly in points but for Hamilton having to stop again because of a loose headrest.At Monza Hamilton had taken the championship lead for the first time in 13 races. At the next round in Singapore, where Mercedes struggled, Vettel had to make the most of it. Qualifying on pole with Hamilton in fifth was perfect. What followed was not. Faced with a charge from Max Verstappen and Kimi Räikkönen off the line he moved across to defend, the three clashed, all were eliminated. Hamilton went on to win. With a title at stake, playing the percentages and going wide would have been wiser but for that exaggerated zest. The result gave Hamilton a 28-point lead and he took the title.This season the fight is even closer but ambition has again outweighed the long game. In Baku he was too aggressive on the restart and went wide, converting second place to fourth. Once again Hamilton won. Then in France he was too hot into turn one, locked up and hit Valtteri Bottas. Hamilton won, the German was fifth. All were moments of high pressure, all ended up costing Vettel and then there was Germany.He has never won at Hockenheim but grew up close to the circuit and wanted to deliver at home. Here was a cauldron partly of his own making but one intensified by Hamilton’s charge from 14th. After his pit stop Hamilton was 24 seconds behind, seven laps later he had halved the gap. But the German still had track position and likely the race if he kept it on the island, yet overcooked into the Sachskurve and it was over in a moment.He is a keen student of the sport and may later have considered when Jochen Rindt pressured Jack Brabham into an error on the last lap at Monaco in 1970. Certainly there were shades of the mistake he made when hounded by Jenson Button on the final lap at Canada in 2011 which cost him the win.“I don’t need pity. It was my fault,” he said of Germany. “When everything goes well you are cheered, and if you make mistakes you are criticised. So I don’t care much about what people say. I have to be at peace with myself.”Unfortunately the errors are being played out against Hamilton’s performances. Hamilton, for all that he wears his heart on his sleeve and is a passionate, emotional driver, can be ruthlessly clinical. Every facet was on display in Germany. Here then was his heartfelt response to his qualifying setback, saying: “I will die before I give in”. Which he followed with an inch-perfect march though the field and albeit with a little luck, to the win.If anything the pressure on the British driver, facing losing more points in the title fight, was greater. He had done similar at Silverstone and repeatedly throughout his career. Until his mechanical DNF at Austria he was on a 33-race points-scoring streak. Certainly he has flaws but has also shown time and time again almost flawless judgment in when to move, when not to and doing it clean.Vettel’s talent is manifest. The old cliché that he could not overtake is a nonsense he has repeatedly disproved, not least on Fernando Alonso through Curva Grande at Monza. He told the  in Austria: “Of course I am excited at times and feel the adrenalin – anybody who has played sport or competed, it is part of racing.” Which is understandable and he has four titles but these last two years have been the most intense he has faced in competitive terms and the question they have raised is whether he should be quite so at peace with his decision making.It may well be what decides the title this season, as Italy’s Corriere della Sera noted. Describing Hamilton’s race as a “masterpiece of assertiveness and concentration”, it added: “The behaviour of the two star drivers makes the difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/336d6b2612794d47820ce27537c2426cd877a533/0_398_4431_2659/master/4431.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40c50069976b1145ed1a02e00c9a350b","title":"spamilton review a hamilton parody by numbers","story":"Menier Chocolate Factory, London This fast-moving spoof of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical seems torn between admiration and scepticismFor the past 36 years, Gerard Alessandrini has been spoofing musical theatre in a revue called Forbidden Broadway. He now turns his attention to the big one: Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton, which bestrides the West End and Broadway like a box-office colossus.The result is a deft, fast-moving show that made me laugh occasionally but seems oddly torn between gobstruck admiration and cynical scepticism. As Max Beerbohm once said of a tailor who sent him a final-demand letter, Alessandrini is in the peculiar position of crawling on his knees while shaking his fist.The show’s premise is that Miranda wants to revolutionise the Broadway musical in the same way that Alexander Hamilton, as secretary to the treasury, reshaped US identity. This leads to highly specific send-ups of songs from Hamilton: what you might call parody by numbers. Echoing Hamilton’s determination not to throw away his shot, Miranda now sings: “I’m not going to let Broadway rot.” A fey British monarch later appears to ruefully inform us, in reference to Hamilton’s hetero agenda, that “straight is back”. The ensemble also mimic the original’s most rousing number when they sing, with a certain desperation: “I want to be in the film when it happens.” All this is good fun if you’ve seen Hamilton, but pretty abstruse if you haven’t.The show seems uncertain whether it has come to laud Miranda or to lord it over him. It acknowledges his audacity in using rap, hip-hop and R\u0026ampB to record the birth of a nation. At the same, it slyly suggests that few people follow the plot of Hamilton or are able to comprehend all the lyrics. This yields a choice encounter between Miranda and his hero, Stephen Sondheim, who preaches a verbal simplicity that he doesn’t always practise: something neatly parodied when, mocking a famous number from Company, a singer tells us: “Another hundred syllables came out of my mouth.” The real problem with Spamilton, however, is its assumption that we are all steeped in the American musical and share Alessandrini’s encyclopedic frame of reference. He makes some sharp points about the transience of fame by showing how the praise heaped on The Book of Mormon has been eclipsed by that for Hamilton: even the latter, he suggests, may be knocked off its perch by Harry Potter, who tells Miranda: “My show is hotter than yours ever was.” But Alessandrini cannot resist alluding to every show in the musical canon and throws in largely irrelevant items sending up singers from Elaine Page and Liza Minnelli to Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé. It is all put across with great verve by a small cast in the writer’s own production. Liam Tamne captures Miranda’s mix of revolutionary fervour and smiling charm, Eddie Elliott embodies his Aaron Burr-like rival and Julie Yammanee is all quick-change vivacity as the women in Hamilton’s story. Sophie-Louise Dann and Damian Humbley nimbly provide the cabaret guest spots, Gerry McIntyre choreographs inventively and Simon Beck at the piano provides 85 minutes of nonstop music. The show is hard to dislike but, in the end, this is theatre about theatre. I prefer theatre about life.

The result is dangerous In June of last year, five researchers at Facebook’s Artificial Intelligence Research unit published an article showing how bots can simulate negotiation-like conversations.While for the most part the bots were able to maintain coherent dialogue, the researchers found that the software agents would occasionally generate strange sentences like: “Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to.”On seeing these results, the team realized that they had failed to include a constraint that limited the bots to generating sentences within the parameters of spoken English, meaning that they developed a type of machine-English patois to communicate between themselves. These findings were considered to be fairly interesting by other experts in the field, but not totally surprising or groundbreaking.A month after this initial research was released, Fast Company published an article entitled AI Is Inventing Language Humans Can’t Understand. Should We Stop It?. The story focused almost entirely on how the bots occasionally erged from standard English – which was not the main finding of the paper – and reported that after the researchers “realized their bots were chattering in a new language” they decided to pull the plug on the whole experiment, as if the bots were in some way out of control.Fast Company’s story went viral and spread across the internet, prompting a slew of content-hungry publications to further promote this new Frankenstein-esque narrative: “Facebook engineers panic, pull plug on AI after bots develop their own language,” one website reported. Not to be outdone, the Sun proposed that the incident “closely resembled the plot of The Terminator in which a robot becomes self-aware and starts waging a war on humans”.Zachary Lipton, an assistant professor at the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, watched with frustration as this story transformed from “interesting-ish research” to “sensationalized crap”.According to Lipton, in recent years broader interest in topics like “machine learning” and “deep learning” has led to a deluge of this type of opportunistic journalism, which misrepresents research for the purpose of generating retweets and clicks – he calls it the “AI misinformation epidemic”. A growing number of researchers working in the field share Lipton’s frustration, and worry that the inaccurate and speculative stories about AI, like the Facebook story, will create unrealistic expectations for the field, which could ultimately threaten future progress and the responsible application of new technologies.Exaggerated claims in the press about the intelligence of computers is not unique to our time, and in fact goes back to the very origins of computing itself.In February 1946, when the school bus-sized, cumbersome Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (Eniac) was presented to the media at a press conference, journalists described it as an “electronic brain”, a “mathematical Frankenstein”, a “predictor and controller of weather” and a “wizard”. In an attempt to tamp down some of the hype around the new machine, renowned British physicist DR Hartree published an article in Nature describing how the Eniac worked in a straightforward and unsensational way.Much to his dismay, the London Times published a story that drew heavily on his research titled An Electronic Brain: Solving Abstruse Problems Valves with a Memory. Hartree immediately responded with a letter to the editor, saying that the term “electronic brain” was misleading and that the machine was “no substitute for human thought”, but the damage was done – the Eniac was forever known by the press as the “brain machine”.It was a similar story in the United States after Frank Rosenblatt, an engineer at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, presented a rudimentary machine-learning algorithm called the “perceptron” to the press in 1958. While the “perceptron” could only be trained to recognize a limited range of patterns, the New York Times published an article claiming that the algorithm was an “electronic brain” that could “teach itself”, and would one day soon “be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its own existence”.While the giddy hype around AI helped generate funding for researchers at universities and in the military, by the end of the 1960s it was becoming increasingly obvious to many AI pioneers that they had grossly underestimated the difficulty of simulating the human brain in machines. In 1969, Marvin Minsky, who had pronounced only eight years earlier that machines would surpass humans in general intelligence in his lifetime, co-authored a book with Seymour Papert proving that Rosenblatt’s perceptron could not do as much the experts had once promised and was nowhere near as intelligent as the media had let on.Minsky and Papert’s book suffused the research community with a contagious doubt that spread to other fields, leading the way for an outpouring AI myth debunking. In 1972, the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus published an influential screed against thinking machines called What Computers Can’t Do, and a year later the British mathematician James Lighthill produced a report on the state of machine intelligence, which concluded that “in no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised”.This trough of disillusionment ushered in what has since been called the first AI winter, a period in which funding for research in the field dropped off almost entirely. The media, which had drummed up so many inflated expectations for “electronic brains”, also lost interest. While there were small resurgences in the 1980s and 1990s, AI was more or less a topic relegated to the realm of corny sci-fi novelists – computer scientists often avoided the term artificial intelligence altogether for fear of being viewed as “wild-eyed dreamers”.The ice of AI’s first winter only fully retreated at the beginning of this decade after a new generation of researchers started publishing papers about successful applications of a technique called “deep learning”.While this was fundamentally a decades-old statistical technique similar to Rosenblatt’s perceptron, increases in computational power and availability of huge data sets meant that deep learning was becoming practical for tasks such as speech recognition, image recognition and language translation. As reports of deep learning’s “unreasonable effectiveness” circulated among researchers, enrollments at universities in machine-learning classes surged, corporations started to invest billions of dollars to find talent familiar with the newest techniques, and countless startups attempting to apply AI to transport or medicine or finance were founded.As this resurgence got under way, AI hype in the media resumed after a long hiatus. In 2013, John Markoff wrote a feature in the New York Times about deep learning and neural networks with the headline Brainlike Computers, Learning From Experience. Not only did the title recall the media hype of 60 years earlier, so did some of the article’s assertions about what was being made possible by the new technology. “In coming years,” Markoff wrote, “the approach will make possible a new generation of artificial intelligence systems that will perform some function that humans do with ease: see, speak, listen, navigate, manipulate and control.”Since then, far more melodramatic and overblown articles about “AI apocalypse”, “artificial brains”, “artificial superintelligence” and “creepy Facebook bot AIs” have filled the news feed daily.Lipton, a jazz saxophonist who decided to undertake a PhD in machine learning to challenge himself intellectually, says that as these hyped-up stories proliferate, so too does frustration among researchers with how their work is being reported on by journalists and writers who have a shallow understanding of the technology.What Lipton finds most troubling, though, is not technical illiteracy among journalists, but how social media has allowed self-proclaimed “AI influencers” who do nothing more than paraphrase Elon Musk on their Medium blogs to cash in on this hype with low-quality, TED-style puff pieces. “Making real progress in AI requires a public discourse that is sober and informed,” Lipton says. “Right now, the discourse is so completely unhinged it’s impossible to tell what’s important and what’s not.”Lipton is not the first person to express concern about the new AI hype cycle and where it is taking the field. Last year, the pioneering roboticist Rodney Brooks wrote an article criticizing the “hysteria about the future of artificial intelligence” for MIT Technology Review. In 2013, New York University professor Gary Marcus wrote an article for the New Yorker in which he argued that the hype will create unrealistic expectations followed by disillusionment leading to another AI winter.But for Lipton, the problem with the current hysteria is not so much the risk of another winter, but more how it promotes stories that distract from pressing issues in the field. “People are afraid about the wrong things,” he says. “There are policymakers earnestly having meetings to discuss the rights of robots when they should be talking about discrimination in algorithmic decision making. But this issue is terrestrial and sober, so not many people take an interest.”In March last year, Lipton started his own blog to try to counter-balance and deconstruct some of the most damaging sensationalist AI news. So far, he has called out a “low-quality” profile of Elon Musk in Vanity Fair and an uncritical overview of Anthony Levandowski’s so-called AI church, among others.The blog has received some attention from the media and has a regular readership, but Lipton knows that his influence is limited. “What really needs to happen is better training of journalists and more integrity,” he says. “Until that happens, my blog is just a pebble in the rapids of crap. I’m not altering the direction of the stream.”Joanne McNeil, a writer who examines emerging technologies, agrees that there is a problem with uncritical, uninquiring tech journalism, and often uses Twitter to make fun of Terminator-style articles. But at the same time, she is weary of pointing the finger solely at journalists and believes that one of the causes of AI hype is an uneven distribution of resources.“If you compare a journalist’s income to an AI researcher’s income,” she says, “it becomes pretty clear pretty quickly why it is impossible for journalists to produce the type of carefully thought through writing that researchers want done about their work.” She adds that while many researchers stand to benefit from hype, as a writer who wants to critically examine these technologies, she only suffers from it. “There are few outlets interested in publishing nuanced pieces and few editors who have the expertise to edit them,” she says. “If AI researchers really care about being covered thoughtfully and critically, they should come together and fund a publication where writers can be suitably paid for the time that it takes to really dig in.”While closer interaction between journalists and researchers would be a step in the right direction, Genevieve Bell, a professor of engineering and computer science at the Australian National University, says that stamping out hype in AI journalism is not possible. Bell explains that this is because articles about electronic brains or pernicious Facebook bots are less about technology and more about our cultural hopes and anxieties.“We’ve told stories about inanimate things coming to life for thousands of years, and these narratives influence how we interpret what is going on now,” Bell says. “Experts can be really quick to dismiss how their research makes people feel, but these utopian hopes and dystopian fears have to be part of the conversations. Hype is ultimately a cultural expression that has its own important place in the discourse.”Ultimately, Lipton agrees that there is a place for speculative writing about AI and he acknowledges how imagination and emotion can motivate inquiry in the field. “But I also think that boundary between wild speculation and real research is a little too flimsy right now,” he says. “As history shows us, this is a boundary that needs to be monitored so we can distinguish between what’s important in the here and now and what’s just fantasy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3457ce6d22ef0a7b9bdf4ce69b6e15158bb0e888/0_399_3843_2306/master/3843.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e56eefd2c1c46ff70c90ba70d314c2","title":"peaky blinders take chicago which british shows deserve a us spin off","story":"ITV’s Bletchley Circle women are relocating to 1956 San Francisco. If that works out, which other stalwarts should book a one-way ticket west?This is a big week for fans of soft reboots and relatively unheralded 2012 period dramas: the Bletchley Circle women – or at least half of them – are back. The series about a quartet of former second world war code-breakers resisting the starchy social strictures of 1950s Britain by teaming up to solve crimes has now crossed the Atlantic, with Rachael Stirling’s glam governess, Millie, and Julie Graham’s fastidious Scottish librarian, Jean, relocating to San Francisco in 1956. (“And I thought Edinburgh was hilly,” mutters Jean.)Why the abrupt transatlantic move? The plot sees the pair on the trail of a nefarious GI who, having previously strangled one of their Bletchley workmates, has apparently resumed his lethal ways in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge. The rather more prosaic reason is that The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco has been revived by an injection of cash from BritBox, a US streaming service specialising in repeats of old BBC and ITV shows. BritBox knows its subscribers love British accents, but are hedging their first move into original programming by guaranteeing an exciting backdrop of west-coast jazz clubs and cool, curvy cars rather than petrol rationing and the introduction of double-yellow lines. If it works, it could be the beginning of a new wave of transatlantic period drama. So what other British shows should dust off their vintage blue passports and “do a Bletchley”?Winston Graham wrote 13 Poldark novels set in Cornwall, so the latest BBC adaptation will not run out of source material any time soon. The day will come, however, when Aidan Turner hangs up his tricorn hat for good, and that might be the exact moment to pitch a Poldark prequel: something Cornish yet even more past-y. The broad outline is in the books – young Ross was arrested for brawling in 1780 and only joined the army to escape jail, ending up as a disgruntled infantryman in the American war of independence – but otherwise prequel writers could allow their imaginations to run wild. What sort of mischief did Ross get up to in 18th-century New York? What was his meet cute with loyal pal Dr Dwight? And, crucially, how did he get that scar?If Steven Knight’s world-conquering 1920s Birmingham gang saga can be adapted into a ballet it does not seem too much of a stretch to imagine a spin-off set in Chicago at the height of prohibition. Tommy Shelby currently seems to have his hands full pursuing a political career, but what if one of his henchmen lit out for the Windy City to escape prosecution at home? A hatchet-faced Brummie in a flat cap violently carving out a piece of the bootlegging action in one of the most corrupt cities in the world? Sounds like a rapid-fire hit.Christopher Timothy, Robert Hardy and Peter Davison created such a beloved chemistry on screen that to attempt to remake All Creatures Great and Small seems almost disrespectful. Better, then, to orce the series inspired by James Herriot’s autobiographical novels from its 1940s Yorkshire setting. What if, after graduating from Glasgow veterinary college, the young, eager Herriot rocked up in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1940, a city still dusting itself off from the effects of the Depression? True, pet ownership was probably not a priority for people in a city still dusting itself off from the effects of the Great Depression, but young Herriot would be required to get to grips with fearsome-looking longhorn cattle.A few narrative backflips may be required to coax Martin Shaw’s glumly principled 1960s copper from his Newcastle base all the way to Magic City, but watching him patiently operate against a glitzy backdrop of dapper mobsters, powerful mojitos and illicit gambling feels as if it would have some strong fish-out-of-water potential, especially if his impressively sideburned sidekick DS John Bacchus – a man always ready to indulge his vices – also made the trip.Julian Fellowes, the jolly Midas of period dramas, may be attempting to assemble as many original cast members as possible for his Downton movie, but it still feels like there would be plenty mileage in a US-focused spin-off, possibly centred on Lady Cora’s yacht-obsessed brother, Harold (Paul Giamatti). Stick him in a big Gatsby-esque pile in 1920s Rhode Island, surround him with a swirl of visiting socialites and their various servants and you could re-create the spirit of old England in New England … even if might take millions to tempt Giamatti away from Billions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b90a44a46499adc44a593e09a90d42db801c894/0_84_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30208476bf79e51571e184c0a5737694","title":"theresa may loves ncis of course she does its as exciting as a bathroom tile","story":"After a hard day mucking up Brexit, the PM says she likes nothing more than to unwind with the most boring series on TV. It all makes sense, doesn’t it?We’re doomed. I mean it. We’re absolutely screwed. I’ve examined this from every possible angle and the results are never anything less than horrifying. This country is on a one-way hell-ride to the toilet, and for one simple reason: Theresa May likes NCIS.Sure, I’d heard the rumours, too, that our elected leader was a secret NCIS head. But until now I’d managed to convince myself that it couldn’t possibly be true, on the basis that it makes absolutely no sense. Nobody likes NCIS. Nobody. You could go out and find the world’s most frothing, raving, diehard NCIS fan and they’d still tell you that NCIS was only their fourth-favourite show. Because that’s the sort of show NCIS is. It’s less a television programme and more a thing that’s on TV sometimes.However, there it is, plain as day. Asked this week how she likes to unwind, May replied: “Does anybody here know the American series NCIS? I quite like watching NCIS when I can.”Now, if you’ve never seen NCIS, you’re missing nothing. It’s one of those dull, empty, by-the-numbers procedurals that has helped to choke the life out of US network television. Every week a thing happens, and then a lineup of blandly interchangeable characters with no inner life solve the thing, and then the exact same thing happens the following week. That’s NCIS. It’s like one of those anxiety dreams you have on flu medication, where you’re trapped in a circular corridor, with the floor made of treacle.NCIS started as a spinoff of the series JAG, and then went on to create its own spinoffs. At this point nobody can pinpoint exactly where it began or where it will end. It’s mycelium, basically. It’s connective tissue. It serves no purpose other than to reinforce its own existence. You can’t hate a programme like NCIS, because it consistently fails to inspire that level of interest. It’d be like trying to hate an off-white bathroom tile.Now the cynic in me might suggest that May doesn’t really like NCIS. The cynic in me might suggest that May just gave NCIS as an answer because she heard it was popular and, as a politician, she is pathologically inclined to pretend to like popular things because anything too esoteric would alienate the electorate.But I cannot fully subscribe to this theory, because in my heart I believe her. I believe that May genuinely enjoys coming home after a hard day of mucking up Brexit and watching hour after hour of blandly pointless anti-television. You get the feeling that she has never truly felt passionate about anything, so it only makes sense that her favourite TV show is something that it’s impossible to feel passionate about.Still, at least this answers the question of why NCIS is so popular. Because until now the weirdest thing about NCIS is that it always manages to get huge ratings despite nobody ever claiming to like it. Until now the assumption was that NCIS was simply the Shy Tory of television. But now maybe there’s a better explanation. Maybe NCIS gets such huge numbers because Theresa May has kitted out her entire living room with a bank of televisions, all simultaneously showing different episodes of NCIS around the clock.Listen, it could always be worse. Imagine if May had given a buzzy hipster Netflix show as her answer. Imagine if she’d said Dark or Easy. Imagine the devastating effect on the stock market as everyone realised she actually had time to discover and enjoy anything as interesting as that. We’d be done for, even more than we are now.Still, the fact remains that NCIS – of all the shows on television – is May’s favourite. And, since we voted her in, this means it has to be our favourite, too. So let’s all binge-watch every NCIS episode together in celebration. Let’s paint murals of whoever it is who acts in it these days. Let’s replace the national anthem with the NCIS theme tune, whatever that is. Seriously, I just listened to it and I can’t remember how it goes.

Experts say the increasing tensions are fundamentally altering the once robust and “special” relationship.Peters – well-known for his blunt rhetoric – is now demanding that Australia change its flag because it is too similar. “We had a flag that we’ve had for a long time, copied by Australia, and they should actually change their flag and honour the fact that we got there first with this design, being decided by a prime minister and his legacy,” Peters told TVNZ.This is not the first time Peters has called on Australia to come up with a new flag design, arguing in a 2016 opinion piece that New Zealand’s flag should be restored to its “unique” status. “One argument used against our flag is that it is too like Australia’s, which borrowed our design in the first place,” Peters wrote. “However, since Australian political leaders have recently signed to have their own head of state it is Australia that will have to change its flag, and soon. That will rightly restore our flag to being unique as it was in the beginning.”The New Zealand and Australian flags bear a striking resemblance, with both featuring a royal blue background, a union jack in the lefthand corner, and the southern cross.The New Zealand flag is 50 years older than Australia’s and was adopted in 1902, replacing the union jack. The Australian flag was adopted in 1954, after going through three previous iterations since 1901.New Zealander William Stevens was one of five winners who submitted a design for the Australian flag in 1901, all of which were so similar they were described as identical at the time, with commentators joking that if New Zealand decided to become part of Australia changing the flag would be a simple process with another star added to the southern cross.Both the Australian and New Zealand flags are based on the British blue ensign.Bill English, the deputy prime minister at the time, said there had been a “robust democratic process” that allowed New Zealanders “to discuss who we are and how we want to be represented on the world stage”.The two flags have sometimes been mixed up on public occasions. Earlier this year the nine network used a graphic of the New Zealand flag during Australia Day coverage, while the Australian and New Zealand flags were mistakenly switched during a medal presentation at the Rio olympics."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"David Johnson Stangaciu lacerated chest when he fell onto partly open manholeCase brought against NUIG for gender-biased promotionsT\u0026aacutenaiste dismisses idea of no-deal outcome as Eurosceptic \u0026lsquobravado\u0026rsquoWildfires sweeping through the Greek resort town of Mati, east of Athens, kill at least 80Conference aimed at restoring powersharing in Stormont after its collapse in January 2017Jim Daly says using online applications to tackle the crisis was a key focus of plansChecks by uniformed officers will be necessary once the UK leaves the EUFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says how Taoiseach operates \u0027all about optics, all about spinning\u0026rsquoSettlement costs likely to run to hundreds of thousands of euroFinian McGrath has visited Dr Bassam Naser in prison who is \u0026lsquovery remorseful\u0026rsquoEuropean Commission takes action against 17 EU member states including Ireland over EU directiveIrish charities have income of \u0026euro14.5 billionNew ESRI study looks at who is most likely to experience five barriers to social inclusionNursing Homes Ireland chief executive Tadhg Daly says move will make system fairerLicence fee collection to be reviewed in wake of evasion costs running at \u0026euro40m annuallyApp encourages homeowners and local businesses to help families attending hospitalSearches of Garda Pulse records indicate 150 cases at issue and require further examination"},{"url":null,"title":"aerial footage shows burnt out dunes at curacloe strand","story":"  July 22, 2018Swimming race and surf lessons cancelled as emergency services urge people to stay away from Wexford beach   July 23, 2018Investigations are continuing into large blaze that ripped through 13 acres at Curracloe "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3576016.1532515188!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney says ireland would back brexit extension talks request","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney said the Government would back any request by the UK to extend the deadline for Article 50 negotiations Photograph: Tom HonanThe Government would back any request from the UK for an extension to the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate withdrawal from the EU, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.The Tánaiste rejected Eurosceptic talk of a no-deal Brexit as “bravado” and said he believed there was still time to reach agreement by October.But called for an “intensification” of talks at official level over the summer to resolve outstanding differences.Elements of the UK negotiating position laid out in UK prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit white paper would be difficult for Brussels to accommodate, he warned, though he added that the document had made negotiations “easier” by backing away from earlier red lines.He dismissed suggestions that amendments to Brexit legislation forced on Ms May by Eurosceptic backbenchers would prevent agreement on a “backstop” arrangement for the Northern Irish border.Mr Coveney was speaking as talks continued in Brussels, with a meeting between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab scheduled for Thursday.Ms May confirmed on Tuesday that she had taken personal charge of the negotiations, with Mr Raab “deputising” for her in Brussels.Tory Eurosceptics have voiced concerns that Mr Raab’s department has been sidelined by Number 10 and Ms May’s Europe adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that isions within the Conservative camp may result in a no-deal Brexit.Mr Coveney confirmed that the Government was making contingency plans to cope with Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.But he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The truth is I don’t believe that Britain can afford a no-deal Brexit, I don’t believe Ireland or the EU want that either.“The negative implications of a no-deal Brexit are very significant for Ireland and the UK. We all have an obligation to make sure that doesn’t happen. I think it’s very unlikely to happen.”Asked whether the Government would back an extension of the Article 50 process, Mr Coveney said: “Absolutely, if Britain asks for more time and if that is necessary to get to a sensible agreement, we would support that, of course we would.“But I think, even though the timetable is tight, it is possible to achieve an outcome that is good for Britain and good for the EU within the timelines that are currently there. But it also requires an intensification of the negotiations on Brexit.”Mr Coveney said that the UK had been “negotiating with itself” in the six months before the publication of the white paper.“We now have clarity in terms of what the British government ask is,” he said. “I think there are elements of that that would be difficult to negotiate... but I think it is easier to achieve now.”Potential stumbling blocks in Ms May’s plan include the separation of regimes for goods and services and the creation of a “complex” new customs arrangement under which different tariffs are charged for imports destined for the UK or EU, he said.But he rejected the idea that the amendment passed by the Commons barring a customs border in the Irish Sea would make it impossible to agree the EU’s backstop plan for Northern Ireland.“You can’t have a negotiation on the basis of passing laws in your parliament or introducing amendments in your parliament and then saying, ‘Sorry, we have no flexibility now’,” he said.“The European Union could do the same and we would get nowhere.”Mr Coveney’s comments came as more details emerged of planning for a no-deal Brexit.Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs he had asked officials to “work up options for stockpiling” by the pharmaceutical industry, while Mr Raab said the Government would also take steps to ensure an “adequate food supply”.Sarah Wollaston, chairwoman of the Commons Health Select Committee, called for more clarity about the Government’s plans.The pro-EU Tory told BBC’s Newsnight: “It’s not just about stockpiling here, there are some products that can’t be stockpiled.“Around 700,000 diagnostic tests every year in the NHS require medical radioisotopes but these have very short shelf-lives, they can’t be stockpiled and they aren’t manufactured here.”Two former Northern Ireland secretaries, Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers, wrote in the Daily  that technological solutions can be made to work to keep the Irish border soft, “if only they are not delayed by political squabbles”.Meanwhile, efforts to repair the European Union’s relationship with the White House will see Jean-Claude Juncker meet Donald Trump in Washington for talks on the trade dispute between the US and its allies.Ahead of the meeting, the US president tweeted to suggest abolishing tariffs between the US and EU only hours after another tweet in which he declared “tariffs are the greatest!”.He wrote: “The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them.“Both the US and the EU drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade!

Photograph:  North West NewspixTaoiseach Leo Varadkar was “chancing the arm” by suggesting a general election should be held in 2020, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has said.Mr Varadkar last week proposed that the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna Fáil should continue for two years beyond the current agreed term which concludes at the end of the year.The two party leaders met to discuss the budget, Brexit and the confidence and supply deal which underpins the Fine Gael-led minority government with Fianna Fáil’s support.Speaking on the sidelines of the MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Co Donegal, Mr Martin took issue with the leaking of the proposal to extend the agreement until 2020. He suggested the Taoiseach was trying to create instability by increasing speculation about the next election.“I’m not going to be governed by political manoeuvres by Fine Gael because I think the public are not interested in the bubble of Leinster House and the games that some politicians get up to. This is too serious,” he told reporters.Mr Martin said the 2020 proposal was “thrown out” at the meeting by Mr Varadkar. “It wasn’t discussed. He threw it out, but there wasn’t any serious discussion.There’s a bit of chancing the arm going on there.The Fianna Fáil leader added: “If you’re serious about discussing issues to facilitate government you don’t actually behave like that.”Mr Martin also said there was “no need” for a emergency national meeting on the identity of his party, as suggested by Carlow-Kilkenny TD John McGuinness.Mr McGuinness said he believed the party has been damaged by being “handcuffed” to the Government by the confidence and supply agreement after an opinion poll showed Fianna Fáil trailing Fine Gael by 13 points at the weekend.“I met all my TDs, the bulk of them in the last two months. No one has articulated, bar yesterday, the need for a special ardfheis. Let’s keep as calm as we can here...Let’s not run away with ourselves.”On the upcoming presidential election, Mr Martin said Fianna Fáil would support President Higgins, but the idea of committing any resources to his campaign had “never been on the table”.He said Fianna Fáil councillors would be allowed to nominate other candidates to stand against Mr Higgins as he did not “want to trample on the constitutional prerogative of councillors” to assist people in getting on the ticket.However, he said he did not “believe in opposing somebody for the sake of opposing somebody. The last incumbent to be challenged was back in 1966, there’s a reason for that.”On Brexit, Mr Martin said the UK Conservative Party was “beyond satire and has long ceased to be amusing”.“It has put to rest any lingering sense of the seriousness of the self-regarding and childishly-erudite class of public figure which emerges from many of their most prominent schools.”He criticised Brexiteers, including MP Jacob Rees Mogg, who this week said the benefits of Brexit might not be felt for 50 years.“That kind of sums it up, doesn’t it. There are no benefits. There’s a mistaken view that you leave a market of 500 million and you suddenly discover other markets out there that are more lucrative.”Mr Martin told the summer school that the decision by then UK prime minster David Cameron to hold a referendum on Brexit was “one of the most disastrous failures of leadership in a modern democracy”.“It is not just that the people were presented with a dishonest and incomplete question – it showed a cavalier disregard for one of the greatest achievements of modern democracies, the peace and reconciliation agenda in Northern Ireland.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3575958.1532508101!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new customs facilities being built in dublin port ahead of brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNew checks and facilities are being put in place at Dublin Port in anticipation of Brexit Photograph: Eric Luke.

We had 11 civil servants down at five o’clock in the morning last week to have a look at ships discharging at that time, to get a sense of the scale of what is going to be necessary, precisely so we don’t get queues when the necessary checks are put in place, whenever that may be.” Mr O’Reilly has previously said if the new customs checks are not needed in March 2019, he has “reasonable certainty” they will be needed 12 months after that.Discussions have been ongoing between Dublin Port, the Office of Public Works and other State agencies about “what they require in Dublin Port”.Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Wednesday, he said works are also being carried to “strenghten, deepen and build new piers and jetties” as bigger ships circumventing the UK are already arriving. “We are seeing larger ships coming already, tending now to go on routes directly to continental Europe,” he said. Dublin Port announced on Tuesday it would invest up to €1 billion in new facilities over the next 10 years.Cargo volumes in the first half of the year are better than expected. Publishing details of a revised masterplan, the port said that by the end of this year its business will have grown about 37 per cent over the past six years.Roll-onroll-off (ro-ro) freight increased 4.6 per cent in the first half of the year, container volumes increased 5.8 per cent while tourism numbers are also up – 2.7 per cent on last year, with ferry passenger numbers reaching almost 800,000. The number of cruise ships calling to the port rose by 14 to 64. Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Pakistan is to hold general and provincial elections on  July 25th. Photograph: Shahzaib AkberEPATwo cats are fighting under a peepal tree in the gardens of the Punjab Club, a screeching whirl of black and ginger momentarily disturbing the genteel tranquillity of Pakistan’s most exclusive private members’ club.This is where the cream of the country’s elite exchange high-society gossip over single malt and cigars in the antiquated confines of the Oak Room, with its displays of pistols and crossed swords, their every whim attended to by waiters in turbans. Steeped in memories of the Raj, they seek refuge from the present-day political turmoil.“So good to see you.”“Where have you been?”“It’s been so long!”Voices echoing in the marbled lobby, they greet each other in English before launching into Urdu, these politicians, judges, lawyers and business people. Beneath the crystal chandeliers, they hold muted discussions on an allegedly dirty election blighted by rumours of military backing for cricketing legend Imran Khan. It’s a contest that could upend the current order, break the duopoly of the country’s two political dynasties: the Bhuttos and the Sharifs.The stakes are high, but voices are never raised. Etiquette is everything. Decorum rules.At lunch, I sit next to two men representing different strands of the elite, the air fragrant with tuberose, vaguely wondering if I’ve selected the right fork for the rondelles of pink meat studded with olives.Farid, a businessman from one of the country’s most prestigious families, signed me in. His loyalties are with Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. Like Khan, he attended nearby Aitchison College, the Eton of Pakistan. The old boys’ network is alive and well, even if the mercurial politician has turned his back on his debonair past, making new chums like Amir Liaquat Hussain, a religious hardliner with a penchant for accusing liberals of blasphemy.But the old chums don’t forget. Khan’s power push might not be quite cricket, but they cling to the belief he will make good on his promises of creating, well ... a country that works.“The true Imran will emerge,” says Farid.Sitting next to us is Ashtar, a gimlet-eyed former attorney general, said to have the ear of ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Sharif would have been standing against Khan if he hadn’t been jailed for corruption. Ashtar is now providing legal counsel to members of Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, which is being targeted in an industrial-scale corruption crackdown on the old guard. He terms it a “judicial coup”.“The caretakers have become undertakers for Nawaz and the cradle rockers for Imran,” he declares. It’s not idle talk. Ashtar fought for an independent judiciary during the military dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf, landing in jail, where he suffered a heart attack.We all look out the floor-to-ceiling windows, beyond the phoenix palms to the shimmering waters of the club’s pool. “The fish is good,” says Farid, looking slightly queasy.With Farid’s help, I book a night in one of the sedately furnished rooms, which gives me access to the main attraction. After a refreshing swim, I chat to one of the club’s female members, who works as a psychologist. It’s so hard to work out what’s going on in this country where “tables can be turned at any moment”. But, by the sound of things, it’s harder still to understand Imran Khan.The psychologist supported Khan in the last election. No matter what, Khan is still “one of us”, she says. But his erratic taste in women disturbs her. British heiress Jemima Goldsmith, mother of Khan’s two sons, is considered his true love. Then came Reham Khan, a former BBC weather presenter, who has just dished the dirt on their 10-month marriage in a pre-election book, alleging drug-abuse and philandering. And now he’s with Bushra Maneka, a spiritual healer, who appeared in recent wedding photos with her entire face covered by a red veil.What is Khan playing at? The Lahore elite know him. And they know Bushra is not his type of woman. He’s searching for something he can only find within, says the psychologist.We could talk Imran all day long, but there’s something I need to know, something that goes deeper than the current political intrigues. In the Teak Room, over tankards of sharp Murree beer, I quiz Farid and Ashtar on Pakistan’s post-colonial identity. How did the Pakistani elite come to adopt an institution symbolic of Empire’s worst excesses, the sort of place that would have once had a sign saying “No dogs or Indians” at the entrance?The pair immediately warm to the subject. Ashtar says that top-ranking local administrators, the so-called “brown sahibs”, needed to retain power and order in the bloody chaos of partition. He understands that the notion might be perplexing. After all, the Brits dressed the waiters in those turbans to humiliate the Mughal nawabs. “It was out of spite,” he says. “If I had my way, I’d make them wear bow ties.”Why doesn’t he present a motion to the board?“I might just do that,” he says, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.In the 71 years of Pakistan’s often violent history, the Punjab Club has served a purpose, proving a refuge where views can be freely expressed. “Respect for other peoples’ opinions is like a balm,” says Ashtar.Only the cats serve as a brief reminder of the wild world outside the high walls. A waiter sends them scarpering with a well-aimed straw broom.And peace returns – for an afternoon, at least."},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.New doctors \u0026#39manual\u0026#39 on how to treat child blast victims in conflicts which ignore the rules of warGreece wildfires: Father in desperate search for twins last seen in TV rescue footage as death toll hits 80 UK weather: Heatwave set to soar to 37C amid fears train lines will buckle in heat and reservoirs run dryMacron jokes \u0026#39he\u0026#39s not my lover\u0026#39 as he takes full responsibility for bodyguard scandalComment: The MOT test is obsolete and makes our roads no safer - it\u0026#39s time to scrap itMan with no penis admits sexually assaulting two women who thought they were having sex with himUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse of the century on FridayWoman must stay in unhappy marriage, judges rule, as they urge Parliament to change orce law Deposed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont says he will return to BelgiumCo-ordinated Isil suicide bombs kill more than 50 in southern Syria\u0026#39Parents\u0026#39 arrested after newborn baby Pearl found dead in woodsIslamic State claims responsibility for Toronto shooting as 10-year-old victim namedDozens dead and more than 3,000 in need of rescue after Laos dam collapseDirty John: the queasy true crime podcast set to become Netflix\u0026#39s next big hitBank accounts to pay savers \u0026#39minimum interest rate\u0026#39 under FCA plansIreland\u0026#39s deputy PM: we would support extending Article 50 to get \u0026#39sensible\u0026#39 Brexit dealHeatwave: What are your rights as an employee during hot weather?Guinea worm outbreak dashes hopes of elimination in South SudanTemperatures top 40C on Tube, as passengers told air conditioning will be in place by 2030What is Article 50?

In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly.

So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But critics said that\u0026nbspin some cases pay rises were below inflation.Members of the armed forces will receive an increase of 2.9 per cent (2 per cent consolidated, 0.9 per cent non-consolidated), with the award worth £680 in pay to an average soldier, plus a one-off payment of £300.Public sector pay rises: No more cap but the offer still falls shortFears of more government cuts as public sector pay cap lifted for 1mMay pledge to scrap public sector pay cap unaffordable, says analysisPublic sector pay cap hit spending power by £8.5bn in England- TUCAll prison officers will get at least a 2.75 per cent (2 per cent consolidated, 0.75 per cent non-consolidated) increase this year, with many getting higher awards.Unions and opposition parties raised concerns that the pay awards were not fully funded, warning of fresh cuts to services and jobs.Labour said the government was “raiding” already underfunded budgets of schools, hospitals, prisons, police services and armed forces for what amounted to a real terms pay cut.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “By increasing the pay levels, albeit by less than the rate of inflation, that can only be paid for by cuts within the public services.“And so, if it’s local authorities or anybody else, they’re going to have to pay for it by either removing their balances, which they shouldn’t be doing, or by cutting services further.”Peter Dowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that the announcement was a “mendacious PR stunt”. He added:\u0026nbsp“Today’s announcement shamefully takes money away from our schools, hospitals, prisons, police services and armed forces to fund pay allocations for valued public workers.“Real wages in the public sector are lower today than they were in 2010, yet the reality of today’s announcement is that on top of eight years of cuts to frontline services, and job losses, our police officers, some junior doctors, specialist doctors and dentists are being offered real terms pay cuts.”Matt Hancock, the health and social\u0026nbspcare secretary, said the pay rises for doctors and dentists recognised their “value and dedication”.From October, a consultant that started\u0026nbspwork in 2013 will have seen a 16.5 per cent increase in their basic pay, rising to a salary of £87,665 from £75,249, it was announced.Ministers said the pay rises were worth between £1,150 and £1,550 for consultants, between £1,140 and £2,120 for speciality doctors, between £1,600 and £2,630 for associate specialists, between £532 and £924 for junior doctors, and around £1,052 for a salaried GP with a median taxable income of £52,600.But the British Medical Association said it was “truly astonishing” that the government had “ignored” recommendations from the independent pay review body.Dr Anthea Mowat of the BMA said: “Just last week the new secretary of state talked about how ‘heartbreaking’ it was to see how ‘undervalued’ NHS staff feel.“Considering those words, doctors in England will rightly feel both anger and disappointment that sentiment has not been matched with action.“Since 2008, doctors have experienced the largest drop in earnings of all professions subject to pay review bodies, with consultants seeing a 19 per cent fall in pay, junior doctors 21 per cent and GPs 20 per cent.“The effective pay uplift this year for some doctors will be as little as 0.75 per cent, which will be widely seen as derisory.”Ministers also added that teachers would be in line for a pay rise of up to 3.5 per cent which equates to £1,366 a year.Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Schools and parents will be dismayed that schools will have to find more than £250m from their already stretched budgets.“We are concerned, too, that the Department for Education will be forced by the Treasury to make unacceptable cuts to other parts of its education budget and we will monitor this carefully.”Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “By abdicating responsibility for funding these awards, the Treasury has forced the Department for Education to scramble for money within their own department.“We will have to wait to see what cuts have to be made elsewhere to find this money but it seems like a false economy by the government.”UK news in picturesGreat Britain\u0027s Geraint Thomas cleans his eyes after tear gas was thrown at the pelaton during a farmers\u0027 protest who attempted to block the stage\u0027s route, during the 16th stage of the Tour de France, between Carcassonne and Bagneres-de-Luchon.

She worries her 14-year-old daughter Ishu will be raped when she is moved to a mud hut outside their home for around five days every month.She added: “I have to practice it because of the social pressure. If I didn’t practice it, I would be alone in the community.”Rajkumari, a 23-year-old police constable in the Doti district of western Nepal who works with ActionAid to end the practice, said the scale of the problem was huge.She has only managed to register one chhaupadi case in Doti district in the past four years.“Previously girls were not allowed to go to school during their menstruation. But now girls are going to the school.”The practice of making women sleep outside despite temperatures in Nepal,\u0026nbspsometimes falling\u0026nbspbelow zero in winter, stems from concerns women will anger the gods or contaminate their home if they stay inside.\u0026nbspIn rural areas, it is widely perceived that not following the practice will engender misfortune in the form of natural disasters or sickness or death among family members or livestock. Other myths include thinking that if a woman drinks milk while she is menstruating she will bring harm to her family.While married women generally stay outside for only a few days, others can be banished for up to a week.In November 2016, Dambara Upadhyay died alone after spending four nights outside. The 21-year-old was found by her sister-in-law with blood coming out of her nose. Despite local police suggesting she might have experienced a heart attack the initial post-mortem report was not able to establish a cause of death.While other deaths have been attributed to wild animal attacks, the most common cause is smoke inhalation from fires lit in an attempt to stay warm.A law passed last August that is set to go into effect next month will\u0026nbsppunish people who force women to follow the tradition.Nepal passes law to end practice of exiling women for menstruatingIn Nepal, women are banished from society during their periodsThe new legislation included a grace period to give citizens time to get used to it – with officials claiming overhauling archaic, culturally entrenched attitudes cannot happen overnight.The law will result in violators facing up to three months in prison or a fine of 3,000 Nepalese rupees (£20).But women in the country have said they need more legal support with many\u0026nbspnot yet\u0026nbspaware of the new law.“Cultural taboos around periods can mean many women and girls are forced to manage their periods in uncomfortable, unsanitary and ineffective ways. The extreme end of these stigmas, such as chauppadi, can literally end in death,” Girish Menon, chief executive at ActionAid UK, told The Independent.“The lack of access, knowledge and support can also lead to girls missing or dropping out of school. This puts girls at greater risk of child marriage and early pregnancy, meaning the cycles of poverty, gender inequality and violence against women become harder to break. \u0026nbsp“Women have the right to control their own bodies. This is why we work to provide safe, and clean sanitary products, and work closely with local women activists to challenge harmful practices and social norms to ensure girls can claim their rights to their bodies and lives.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But in many parts of the country, people have travelled to vote regardless of the security issues.\u0026nbspThe senator in charge of PML-N\u0027s election campaign team, Mushaid Hussain, has given a confident news conference in which he suggest that, despite the apparent issues with getting people through polling stations, the party is still happy at this point with the response of its voters.\u0026nbspWe are very confident, but we will issue our detailed report after the polls close, he said.\u0026nbspHe used the news conference to issue three demands: First, that the election commission extend voting hours from 6pm to 7pm secondly, that all voters who get in line before the deadline must be allowed to cast their ballot and thirdly, that polling staff around the country speed up the voting process.The head of the European Union\u0027s observer mission in\u0026nbspPakistan\u0026nbsphas condemned the bombing outside a polling station in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, that officials say killed 32\u0026nbsppeople.\u0026nbspMichael Gahler says 120 EU observers are at 40 polling stations throughout the country as the nation votes but not in Baluchistan because of security concerns.\u0026nbspHe says the monitors also watched as election workers prepared to start the vote on Wednesday, readying ballots and electoral rolls.\u0026nbspGahler will present a preliminary report assessing elections on Friday. He says observers will look into some reports that media access was restricted by military posted at polling stations throughout the country.\u0026nbspPolice in\u0026nbspPakistan\u0026nbspsay more clashes between rival political parties have killed another person and wounded 15 across the country.\u0026nbspOfficer Nasir Ahmed says supporters of the\u0026nbspPakistan\u0026nbspMuslim League and Tahrik-e-Insaf parties clashed during the polling on Wednesday in the city of Khanewal, in Punjab province, firing shots and hurling clubs and stones at each other.\u0026nbspAhmed says four people were taken to hospital with bullet wounds and one of them died. He said 12 people were arrested.\u0026nbspSupporters of the two political parties also clashed elsewhere in Punjab, injuring over a dozen people. There were also skirmishes among political activists in various towns in southern Sindh province but no casualties were reported there. Videos of minor scuffles outside various polling stations have been circulated on social media.Earlier in the day, shooting between supporters of two rival parties left one person dead and wounded two in a village near the northwestern city of Swabi.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBegum Kulsoom Sharif, the mother of former premier Nawaz Sharif and current PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif, has arrived at the Islamia College Railway Road to cast her vote in the NA-124 constituency.There was something of a standoff between security personnel and supporters of the Sharif family, who chanted slogans in support of Nawaz Sharif.

The attack was claimed by Isis militants.About 371,000 soldiers have been stationed at polling stations across the country to prevent attacks, nearly five times the number deployed at the last election in 2013.While we wait for more updates on the Quetta bombing, voting has been suspended at the NA-123 polling station in Lahore, after a clash between supporters and members of the PTI and PML-N parties, a local source told The Independent.\u0026nbspLahore, the capital city of the most populous province of Punjab, is the central battlefield between the two main rivals for victory in this election.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokesman for Quetta hospital, Waseem Baig, told\u0026nbspThe Independent that 15 dead bodies were brought in to the hospital\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp33 injured are under treatment there, a\u0026nbspfew of whom\u0026nbspare in a serious condition.\u0026nbspWitness\u0026nbspMajeed\u0026nbspAkbar said the apparent target of the blast was a police van. He said: The explosion occurred near a school where polling was taking place.

Throughout its history, the country has oscillated between military and civilian rule.Yet while that should be being hailed as an unprecedented landmark of stability for the nation, there have long been warning signs in a campaign that has been one of the most dangerous and distasteful in modern history.From social media to the streets, the vicious nature of the campaign polarised Pakistani society into supporters of Mr Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI) party, and the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) of Mr Sharif.The chief election commissioner (CEC), retired Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza, on Tuesday assured voters that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was “trying its best to hold free, fair and unbiased elections”.In a video message released by the election body, Mr Raza urged voters to fulfil their “duty towards the nation” by casting their votes calmly and responsibly on polling day.\u0026nbspPolling began at 8am local time, and concludes at 6pm. While one side or the other might claim victory as early as Wednesday night, official results could take up the three days to tally.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Until four years ago Fatima Abu Shedeg was not only unable to swim but had never been in a pool.\u0026nbspYet despite the challenges she has faced, she spends her days dreaming of stepping onto the starting block at\u0026nbspthe Tokyo 2020 Games as Gaza’s first Olympic swimmer.\u0026nbspIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. She saw her uncle’s legs blown off in the same airstrike that killed her father and destroyed most of their home in Beit Lahia, north Gaza.\u0026nbspLike many children in the tiny enclave, she suffered from post-traumatic stress.\u0026nbspThen Amjed Tantesh, 42, a swimming coach and one-time Olympic hopeful, encouraged her to learn to swim as a way of channelling her depression and anger.\u0026nbsp“A week after my dad passed away Amjed called my mum and offered me and my brother swimming lessons. My dad was killed by shrapnel from an airstrike which ricocheted off the wall and hit his heart. The same airstrike blew off my uncle’s leg. We were all downstairs screaming,” she said sitting by a small pool filled with murky green water in Gaza City.\u0026nbsp“It’s extremely important for me to achieve my dream, the dream of my family, of my coach, to be the first Gazan swimmer to take part in the Olympics,” she added.\u0026nbspFour years later, the fitness and football fanatic\u0026nbspspends her free time training in grubby and sometimes makeshift pools. Gaza is in the 11th year of an Israeli blockade, meaning Fatima cannot even get hold of proper swimming equipment. She is left to swim in a mismatched pair of pyjamas. If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles long.She said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger.\u0026nbsp“I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,”\u0026nbspshe said.\u0026nbspIn June Save the Children\u0026nbspreported that a staggering 95 per cent of children in Gaza had depression, consistent with deep psychological distress. The charity said the constant threat of conflict, the fear of bombs, and the constant insecurity caused by the unstable political situation had created a psychological crisis in the country.\u0026nbspMany fear Gaza is now on the brink of another war with Israel as tensions have reached boiling point.\u0026nbspOn Friday the Israeli army said one of its soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen near the border, the first Israeli military death near Gaza since the 2014 war. The army unleashed a tide of airstrikes that pummelled over 60 military targets in the enclave, in one of the most intense days of violence in four years.By the end of the day, the Gaza health ministry said that at least four Palestinians had been killed. As fires raged through the strip, a shaky truce brokered by Egypt was enforced. On Saturday, the United Nations urged both sides it was “imperative” to step back from the brink of a “devastating conflict”.At the heart of the latest eruption of hostilities is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests near the border fences that the Israeli army has met with force. More than 140 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire since 30 March, when residents of Gaza first marched on the fences demanding right to return to ancestral lands they were forced from during the 1948 war which surrounded the creation of Israel.\u0026nbspSome of the protesters have taken to launching burning kites and balloons attached with explosives at Israel, sparking more than 750 wildfires and scorching 2,600 hectares of land.The Palestinians maintain the protests are peaceful and Israel is firing on them with live ammunition. Israel says their soldiers have been attacked and the wildfires are endangering Israeli citizens.\u0026nbspEarlier this week saw the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza and Israel since the 2014 conflict. Egypt reportedly intervened to stop war breaking out.Amid the escalating conflict, children, like Fatima, have suffered the most.\u0026nbspMr Tantesh said there were few resources or outlets for the youth to deal with trauma, though\u0026nbspswimming had\u0026nbspproven\u0026nbspa cheap alternative.\u0026nbspHe launched his swimming initiative in 1999 and said he has since taught more than\u0026nbsp5,400 children to swim. \u0026nbspBecause he initially\u0026nbsplacked access to pools and so, in the aftermath of the 2014 war, Tantesh built a makeshift sea pool\u0026nbspby using concrete blocks from bombed-out buildings to cordon off an area of the beach in north Gaza, where the water is less polluted.\u0026nbspIn 2015 alone, he taught some 465 children, with most of them receiving free swimming lessons.\u0026nbsp“All of them are war afflicted, they have lost a father, mother, relative or they have had a house destroyed,” he told The Independent.“But our new ambition is to prepare some of those children to qualify for the Olympics. Fatima is by far our best chance, she has developed the fastest and so we hope she will represent Gaza in Tokyo 2020. I have never seen such determination and persistence,” he added.Meet the girl who wants to be Gaza’s first Olympic SwimmerFatima Abu Shedeg, 13, dreams of leaping from the blocks at Tokyo 2020Fatima has survived three wars and until four years ago she was not only unable to swim but had never been in a poolIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead.

We were all downstairs screaming,” she said sitting by a small pool filled with murky green water in Gaza City“It’s extremely important for me to achieve my dream, the dream of my family, of my coach, to be the first Gazan swimmer to take part in the Olympics,” she addedFour years later, the fitness and football fanatic spends her free time training in grubby and sometimes makeshift pools. Gaza is in the 11th year of an Israeli blockade, meaning Fatima cannot even get hold of proper swimming equipment. She is left to swim in a mismatched pair of pyjamas. If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles longShe said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger. “I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,” she saidGaza lacks an Olympic-size swimming pool and the few pools it does have struggle to stay open amid chronic energy shortages. It is also increasingly dangerous to swim in the seaFatima hopes one day to get permission to leave Gaza and take her place at the Games.The Palestinian territories have participated in the Olympics since 1996, represented by the International Olympic Committee as they are not formally recognised as a country.Since then more than 20 athletes have taken part, in athletics, judo and swimming. Bar one person, a young judoka from Jerusalem who qualified in London’s 2012 Games, they have all competed on a wild card scheme.The Palestinian Olympic Committee chooses its teams from Gaza, the West Bank and Palestinian communities across the world. So Fatima will face stiff competition while she makes do with scant resources.Gaza lacks an Olympic-size swimming pool and the few pools it does have struggle to stay open amid chronic energy shortages. It is also increasingly dangerous to swim in the sea.\u0026nbspGaza’s environment authority said last year that nearly two-thirds of its 25 mile coastline was seriously polluted.\u0026nbspSewage treatment plants cannot function due to the power\u0026nbspshortages. The United Nations said that more than 100 million litres of waste water are pumped into the sea off Gaza every day.With filthy beaches and not enough electricity\u0026nbspto keep pools clean, trying to train a swimming team is near impossible, according to the Olympic Committee in Gaza.\u0026nbspIn a battered office and sat in front of a battery-powered fan, Munther Masalmeh, the committee’s secretary-general, said it would be a “major achievement” for a swimmer in Gaza to reach the Olympics.“There is not a single pool in Gaza that hits international standards. With our infrastructure problems it makes it even harder. It would be a major achievement to have a female swimmer here because of the lack of resources,” he told The Independent.The Israeli blockade also restricts access to sports equipment. Mr Masalmeh claimed even iron goal posts were banned because the Israelis feared\u0026nbspthey could be used to make weapons.“Sports equipment gets stuck in the ports for year and does not reach the athletes. In addition, the Israelis have in the past banned players from leaving Gaza to participate in international tournaments,” he added.Nonetheless, Fatima hopes one day to get permission to leave Gaza and take her place at the Games.“I want to achieve my dream to be picked for the Olympics, so I can travel and compete in the 100m race,” she said, putting on her swimming pyjamas.“I don’t just want to participate, I want to get first place,\u0026nbspso those who picked me are proud.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Titanic wreck discovery was initially a ruse to throw off trackersHe said: There was a depression in the floor. I thought someone was buried under there that there was a hole. I dug down and found the wall of a well. The hole was full of earth, but with the help of a neighbour, we have managed to get about 17ft deep.I always wanted to dig it out to see if I could find a pot of gold at the bottom, so when I retired that\u0027s what I did. I was quite surprised really, I would have preferred it to be in the garden where I could have got at it a little easier.Using a ladder and a bucket on a pulley system, it took them a total of six months work to get to the depth it is at now.Mr Steer said: We think it\u0027s a bottle well. It\u0027s 30 inches wide now and could go down another 5-6ft. I thought I\u0027d found a sword around 4ft down \u0026ndash it was a wooden thing that must have had a leather sheath on it as you can see stitch holes. That\u0027s why I want to get to the bottom. Who knows what\u0027s down there.We have no idea when it was built. There could have been a couple of cottages here or it could have served a farm. I\u0027d like to find something down the bottom, something to give me an age. I wish I had a Tardis to go back in time and see what was here.Colin Steer with his well inside his living room at his home in Plymouth, Devon (Image: SWNS)The well is a talking point for friends and family of the Steers \u0026ndash some have even thrown money down it and made a wish.But a well and a sword are not the only things the couple have discovered in their home.In 2012, Mr Steer was carrying out building work in the back garden when he unearthed two German incendiary devices with his shovel.A bomb disposal team evacuated the property, including both the front and back garden, as they carried the two devices out in sand boxes before taking them to be vaporised at a safe location.For now, Colin said he will keep going until he reaches the bottom of the well, and he\u0027s more than happy for people to go and have a look."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Gemma-Headley-994031.jpg","title":"mother nine children school no transport council","story":"The council has no plans to re-introduce a bus service as the school is under two miles away (Image: Hull Daily Mail  MEN Media)Phoebe, five, and Matilda, four, are both pupils at the Church of England Infants School in Driffield, a 1.8 mile walk from her home.\u0026nbspIt means she has to walk just over seven miles every day to drop off and collect her children from school.Although there used to be a bus service, that was stopped by East Riding of Yorkshire Council almost two years ago.Gemma said: When one of the other children were in infants they offered a taxi service, but they were put in with the senior school children who had to get a taxi to school because they were causing a nuisance.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club. All the time.Theresa May has the leadership skills of a damp dishcloth, no authority and no political vision.A strong leader needs a clear mission. You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh, let me count the ways. And believe me, it goes waaaay past ten.In fact, there are so many I feel it easier to group them together under various categories.

Hmmm.The fakes ­market will always ­flourish irrespective of how many originals are pulped.So why doesn’t ­Burberry donate the items to upmarket charity ­auctions where people can bid a lot of money for something they might have bought anyway and have the extra thrill of knowing their cash will go to a deserving cause?Model David Gandy says he was once chucked out of a Hugo Boss catwalk show “because I couldn’t fit any of the clothing”.But luckily for the legion of Mr Gandy’s female fans, he can clearly still squeeze his, ahem, lardy self in to a teeny tiny pair of ­Y-fronts.Nope, still not going to wear them.Former Olympic showjumper Lizzie Purbrick has been telling her side of the story after being convicted of criminal damage for spraying her former lover’s home with several litres of pig’s blood.As you do.Lizzie, 63, says that initially, her relationship with Tory peer Lord Prior was “bloody marvellous” after they “met at a dinner party in Norfolk – the hotbed of sex – and I moved in with him four days later.”Whoa. Hang on, rewind that. Genteel Norfolk a hotbed of sex?And lo and behold, two days after this revelation, a survey by our sister paper The Sun on Sunday revealed that the nookie capital of Britain is…drum roll…Norfolk.So quite what they’re putting in the water up there is anyone’s guess.But something tells me house prices are suddenly set to rise.Charlie, 45, told his brother Matthew on the phone: “I’d really like to go out for a bottle of wine. I’ve been let out for a cigarette but I’m very bored.”We’ll take that as a no, then.Activity badges for Guides, Rangers and Brownies have been revamped for the 21st Century.You’ll be relieved to know Moped Mugging isn’t one of them, but there’s “Mixology” which involves designing a menu of non-alcoholic cocktails, “Festival Goer”, Vlogging, Mindfulness, Human Rights, Conscious ­Consumer and Media Critic (everyone’s a bloody critic.)

He said: There was never a second secret White Paper” but “ministers had a series of papers before them”He insisted “there was not sudden twist in the road where one White Paper was done away with and another was written.”Dominic Raab is highly competent and a Brexiter. Naturally, he’s the last person No10 would want involved in talks.Instead our PM and her Remainiac aide Olly Robbins will do it. Raab’s sole role is preparing Britain for the outcome.We warned Mrs May after Chequers she will not survive one more breach of a red line. But we hoped Raab would be around to keep her and Robbins honest.The omens are grim.Tory Brexiteer Craig Mackinlay said: “Quietly somewhere was  a coup detat going on.”Labours Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said: Dominic Raab has been sidelined by the prime minister before he has even had the chance to get his feet under the table.When Mrs May became Prime Minister in 2016 she promised that the negotiations with Brussels would be led by a Brexiteer.She said: I will create a new department responsible for conducting Britain’s negotiation with the EU.It will be led by a senior Secretary of State – and I will make sure that the position is taken by an MP who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

John McDonnell risked a new row by insisting Margaret Hodge\u0027s outburst was out of character, despite the MP repeatedly standing by her remarks. The Shadow Chancellor claimed Dame Margaret harangued Mr Corbyn because of a complete misunderstanding about the party\u0027s code on anti-Semitism. After initially stumbling over his words and describing Labour as anti-racist and anti-Semitist, he said: We are are against anti-Semitism, we are a party that attacks anti-Semitism wherever it is. Yet Dame Margaret has continued to attack both the code and Mr Corbyn days after the confrontation, and has enlisted her lawyers to fight Labour\u0027s probe into her conduct. Today Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Griffith said silencing Dame Margaret would be absurd.  Ms Griffith told a BBC podcast: Margaret quite clearly has had some appalling times herself in terms of prejudice against her and a massive challenge with the BNP to deal with, so if she wants to have a very clear word with Jeremy that’s entirely up to her. The idea that Jeremy would want to set up an atmosphere in the party where people couldn’t go and say things to him is completely absurd. It’s just not his way of dealing things. I think we’d all prefer to have somebody speak to your face rather than behind your back. It’s important that we have those discussions and if it means we need to do a lot more work to get things right let’s do it. Labour MP Steve Double hit back directly at the shadow chancellor, saying: John McDonnell wasn\u0027t there - I was and witnessed the whole thing. She didn\u0027t lose her cool. Passionate and forthright in her views yes but she never lost control.  The extraordinary bust-up happened last week after Labour\u0027s ruling body failed to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism. Jeremy Corbyn later insisted party chiefs had accepted almost all of the code while Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow solicitor general, said parts of Labour\u0027s approach were much stronger. But Labour MPs triggered a fresh vote on backing the full IHRA code, due this September, after a backlash among the Parliamentary party. Dame Margaret confronted Labour\u0027s leader to his face and reportedly called him a f***ing racist and an anti-Semite. She has only denied swearing.  Questioned by the BBC today, Mr McDonnell said: Of course he was upset, I think Margaret was upset as well. Jeremy was deeply upset because, when you have someone haranguing you in that way, of course it\u0027s upsetting. Those sorts of accusations, when he has worked so hard on the issues of anti-Semitism and anti-racism, of course he\u0027s upset. Mr McDonnell said he could understand her anger because there had been a complete misinterpretation of the code. He said: What Margaret did, I think through a complete misinterpretation, she\u0027ll admit it, she was extremely angry, lost her cool, and just basically said - I understand why she did now, on the basis of that misinterpretation.

Seriously ill Jude Carrington suffers from horrific symptoms when he eats - ranging from rashes to extreme abdominal pain. The young boy has been in and out of hospital in search of answers. Doctors have not been able to shed light on his illness and Jude relies on a feeding tube, which he calls Harold, to pump a hypoallergenic formula into his body for 19 hours every day. His family have been given an unexpected boost after a newlywed couple decided to lend their support - despite never having met Jude, from Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire.   His family are determined to raise \u0026pound50,000 to fund research into his condition in America – and have been given a \u0026pound5,000 boost, the Hertfordshire Mercury reports.  In lieu of gifts, Stephen and Nicky Broderick asked guests to support brave Jude’s journey after they were moved by his story in their local newspaper. The pair had tried for a baby of their own for years and after several rounds of IVF finally gave birth to daughter Grace, now eight. “We were about to get married in May and we were asked about wedding presents but we thought we had everything we need so decided to pick a charity instead,” said Stephen. “Then the next day I saw the story in the Mercury and it just touched a nerve.”  The couple made a commitment to guarantee \u0026pound5,000 and their guests raised just under \u0026pound4,000, meaning Stephen and Nicky put up around \u0026pound1,000 of their own. Jude’s mum, Joanna, who said they have had donations from business, friends and strangers in the town, has been overwhelmed by the support for her boy. “We met them [Stephen and Nicky] last month to say thank you, they were just so generous,” she said.elp.” The family are now up to \u0026pound17,000 and hope to get closer to their goal with a charity clairvoyance evening in August and with the help of local football team Soccer Rules, who have made Jude their charity of choice next season. The money could help the family to finally get to the bottom of their boy’s sickness, which causes his body to attack everything he eats and can leave Jude with bloody diarrhoea, among other symptoms.  “It has a massive impact on his life — so much of people’s social lives revolve around food,” Joanna explained in April, while choking back tears. “Jude’s never had a birthday cake, he’s never been able to have an ice cream when we go away on holiday. “We’ve just gone through Easter — he’s never had an Easter egg, there are no Easter egg hunts for Jude. “At school when there are birthdays I have to leave a bag of toys for him to be given when it’s time for cake so he doesn’t feel left out. As a baby, before the condition made itself known, Joanna and dad Steven said Jude loved trying different foods.  But as they pushed forward with weaning him onto a solid diet, the tot became “very unwell” with soon-to-be familiar symptoms including severe acid reflux, vomiting and abdominal distension, where his tiny stomach bloated uncontrollably. In addition to the symptoms he suffers when eating solid food, the Sheredes Primary School pupil also struggles with gastroesophageal reflux disease and gastroparesis. This means his stomach can’t empty itself fast enough and its contents spills back up into his oesophagus, meaning he has to be slow fed continuously whilst taking numerous medicines each day. “He can’t drink enough of what he needs to live, to grow and develop,” Joanna explained. “His stomach is not big enough to take it all in so we have to give him a pump to slowly feed him throughout the day. “His life is about medical routine. It’s always stop-and-start fun because he has to think about his medicine.” But despite everything Jude has had to go through, his parents couldn’t be prouder of his fighting spirit.

Local mum Steph Shaddick slammed the floating Caf\u0026eacute Onboard, at Bideford Quay on social media after yesterday\u0027s incident.  She told Devon Live : The owner asked to \u0027take that screaming baby outside, this is not working for me.\u0027  He made us go outside with our cups, the pram, and food. I had to manoeuvre through the students and had to sit on the side of a table outside. I felt like I had been pushed out. He was just generally rude.  He pointed outside and told us to go out very unpolitely, my baby wasn\u0027t being bad until then - it was just that he wanted the food. I have never had an experience in a business like this before. But in his defence, Robert, who took on the cafe around four and a half years ago said he had asked the 30-year old to take her baby to the outside seating area after he screamed for around 15 to 20 minutes next to a queue of 20 hungry diners. He is also said he is sick of mum\u0027s letting children run riot. He added: A queue began to form at the counter right next to the pram. The baby went ballistic at all these tall people towering over him. The mum did absolutely nothing, she was more focused on her mobile phone - she should have unstrapped him and carried him around. The screaming was so loud we could not hear what people wanted at the counter - the kid just go worse as he was overheated and distressed. They only spent \u0026pound4.50, he added.

But unfortunately there are two big things which get in the way - money and work. While we can\u0027t fix the money part, there\u0027s a company in Manchester which is helping its staff out with the work bit.  Recruitment start-up GradTouch has taken flexible working to a whole new level and is now offering staff unlimited annual leave, reports the Manchester Evening News .  And bosses have found it\u0027s having a really positive impact on their business, which is now growing faster than every.  Last year the average amount of holiday taken by their 22-strong team staff totted up to 46 days. Co-founder Zac Williams explains: We\u0027re huge believers in having a great company culture and we\u0027re pioneering a new way to work. We don\u0027t have set hours in our contracts, instead employees agree to focus only on results. We have an unlimited holiday policy and we encourage our staff to work from wherever they want, whenever they want. This includes the freedom to work from home or trendy coffee shops and only pop into the Northern Quarter HQ when they are required at meetings. The 29-year-old continues: It\u0027s not something that works for everyone. You have to be comfortable with autonomy and you have to be self-motivated to work in that system.  We got rid of contracted hours so all it says is that staff will do what needs to be done to get the job done - but in more legal language. In order for us to build this business we needed to hire people that are better than us and let them get on with their jobs. If you hire properly then you can build a culture based on empowerment and trust. Zac and co-founder Joe Twigg introduced the policy two years ago after a gruelling investment round which brought in \u0026pound500,000. Zac said: Williams said: We were building the platform as quick as we could and a lot of people were doing really long hours.

The singer, who was a close friend of Harry\u0027s late mum, Princess Diana , has opened for the first time up about the nuptials in a TV interview.    Speaking to CNN during the International AIDS Conference 2018 in Amsterdam, he described the couple\u0027s big day as wonderful.  He said: It was very, very wonderful to be there. To have a black gospel choir, a multiracial bride, a black cellist, who was wonderful, a preacher - it felt like a party, and it felt like progress had been made. Thank God, thank God. Elton performed three songs at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s afternoon reception, which was hosted by the queen at St George\u0027s Hall at Windsor Castle - Tiny Dancer, Your Song and Circle of Life.  He added that he thought the wedding was historic.    You go back and watch The Crown and things like that, and in the 1950s Princess Margaret wasn\u0027t allowed to get married [to Group Captain Peter Townsend] because he was divorced. Look how far we have come in that respect.  I think the Queen had a lot to do with it. I think she\u0027s been magnificent, he explained. It was a wonderful thing to be at.

The pranksters couldn\u0027t believe their luck when they put chewing gum in their sleeping pal\u0027s mouth - only for him to wake-up and keep chewing it. Groom-to-be Jamie Baker, 28, couldn\u0027t stop laughing as he videoed the hijinks between his brother, Rhys Baker and his mate, Jake Sandiford, both 19, on their way to his stag do in the party destination. Daring Rhys stealthily slid his used gum into Jake\u0027s gob as he slept open-mouthed in the middle of the flight on July 12. But the smooth prank was escalated to another level when an air stewardess woke Jake up to move his feet from the aisle and the bleary-eyed lad absent-mindedly started chewing the gum.  Despite playing pranks all flight long, poor Jake hadn\u0027t suspected any foul-play and didn\u0027t realise the group\u0027s hysterics were because he was munching on pre-chewed gum. He even offered the group a cheeky grin as they burst into laughter around him. Jamie claims it wasn\u0027t until the group had landed in Magaluf and boarded a coach that they revealed the deception to unwitting Jake - and he branded them \u0027disgusting\u0027. The video immediately went viral when it was shared online at the weekend, with 3.4million views and 85,000 likes, comments and shares. Jamie, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, said: We just did it for a laugh. There were a few pranks on us all. This was probably halfway through the flight. It\u0027s the air stewardess that makes it when she wakes him up. She couldn\u0027t have timed it any better. I couldn\u0027t breathe - I was laughing my head off. It was hilarious. Jake thought we were laughing because the air stewardess woke him up. He chewed the gum all the way there. We left him to it.  It was about another hour or so for the rest of the flight. He had nowhere to put it on the plane, so that\u0027s why it ended up going all the way to Magaluf. Jake didn\u0027t realise until we got on the coach [in Magaluf] and that was when we laughed and showed him the video. He was fuming and saying that it was disgusting. He was fine though. He\u0027s a good sport anyway. The stag do was quality. I said to the lads I think we peaked too soon. We were laughing all the way there about the video. I\u0027m really overwhelmed by the response [to the video]. I wasn\u0027t expecting anything like that. Everyone\u0027s going mad about all the notifications they\u0027re getting. Jake really does think he\u0027s on top of the world because all his friends and bosses have seen it and everything. He thinks he\u0027s a celebrity.

Loujain Al-Hathloul, 28, is among nine women held during a brutal crackdown in May just as the desert kingdom was about to allow women to drive for the first time. At the time campaigners were bidding to use the lifting of the driving ban as a springboard for further reforms such as ending Saudi Arabia’s restrictive male ship system and allowing more freedom of speech. But instead they were rounded up, thrown in jail and now face charges of treason that carry the harshest prison sentence, or even the death penalty. Kareem Chehayeb, Saudi Arabia researcher for Amnesty International, said: The Saudi authorities don’t want any change to come from below. They want to stifle any form of dissent or human rights activism.  It appears that the only reforms that are acceptable are those that are coming from above, which is absolutely outrageous.  Al-Hathloul’s arrest came two years after she attended a One Young World humanitarian summit with the then Meghan Markle , Emma Watson, Cher as well as the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.  In one picture Meghan was in a group of four posing by the water’s edge with Al-Hathloul, the poet Fatima Bhutto and former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson. Writing about the summit at the time Meghan said: One Young World invites young adults from all over the world who are actively working to transform the socio-political landscape by being the greater good. They are delegates who are speaking out against human rights violations, environmental crises, gender equality issues, discrimination and injustice. They are the change. In March al-Hathloul, who has 316,000 Twitter followers, was stopped by police as she drove near her university in Abu Dhabi and put on a plane back to Saudi Arabia where she was banned from leaving the country or using social media. Despite not posting any more Tweets, she was among seven Saudis detained two months later, five women and two men who had supported their cause, including a lawyer who had represented al-Hathloul in the past. Yesterday Amnesty International revealed the Riyadh authorities had claimed the prisoners were confessing to communicating with Saudi Arabia’s enemies, and ‘providing financial and moral support to hostile elements abroad’.

Thunderstorms and torrential downpours are expected from 2pm in parts of the East Midlands, East of England, North East, North West, London and South East England, and Yorkshire and Humber. It\u0027s prompted the Met Office to put a yellow warning in place. It comes after England has been weeks without rain and as much as 30mm (1.2in) is expected to fall in just an hour. There\u0027s also a chance of hail and strong winds as the temperature could drop back to the high 20s, meteorologist Alex Burkill said. Cavendish, in Suffolk, was the hotspot on Tuesday with the temperature reaching 31.4C, 23C higher than the lowest temperature recorded, at Drumnadrochit, near Loch Ness in the Highlands, at 8C.  Today is due to be warmer, with temperatures of 33C expected in East Anglia and the south-east. The Local Government Association said social workers, community wardens and maintenance staff are all on high alert to identify those who could be struggling in the heat. And pet owners have been urged to avoid exercising their dogs and other animals in the hottest parts of the day due to the risk of burnt paws on scorching pavements, as well as the chance of heatstroke. As the harvest begins early in many places following the driest first half of summer on record, farming leaders warned crops are being hit. They added that reservoirs for watering vegetables were running dry and livestock owners were having to use winter feed for their animals as summer grass had withered away. The heatwave baking Britain comes as extreme hot weather grips northern Europe.

The firm wants to take water from Lakes Windermere, Ullswater and Ennerdale after forecasters warned the heatwave could last until September. Britain has been experiencing an extended spell of warm weather with temperatures set to hit 35C by the end of the week. The news comes after The Mirror revealed how United Utilities water bosses pocketed \u0026pound180million dividend despite losing quarter of supply through leaks. The biggest shareholder windfall comes as seven million United Utilities customers across the North West of England face restrictions on the water they use in their homes from August 5.  Now water bosses want to pump supplies from the Lake District as shortages are expected due to the heat. The North West is the hardest hit region as it relies on surface water which evaporates in a heat wave. Utilities United now want six-month drought permits so they can take water from Lakes Windermere and Ullswater, reports The Sun. They have also requested a permit to pump more water from Ennerdale, which feeds a conservation area, which would last three months. The firm wants to take an extra 51million litres from Ullswaterd and 24million litres from Windermere, up from 300million and 200million per day respectively.  Utilities United currently loses 430million litres every day due to leaks in their system. The Environment Agency will decide within the coming days whether to grant the permits. Martin Padley, United Utilities Water Services Director, said: “Applying for drought permits is not a decision we have taken lightly. “We are working closely with the Environment Agency to ensure that water supplies are protected for both customers and the environment.” Environment Agency Drought Manager Jim Ratcliffe stressed: “Any drought permit would only be issued to United Utilities after public \u0026shyconsultation and a review of all the available data.” As the heatwave continues, those who hose parched gardens or fill paddling pools for kids to cool down in during the long school holidays face a \u0026pound1,000 fine.  Households are also urged to take shorter showers to help save water – while the equivalent of a bath and a half per household is wasted through leaking pipes that United have failed to plug. United Utilities was handed an \u0026pound8million “under-performance” penalty last year and it lost 25% of supplies through leaking pipes. The firm said its total dividend of 39.73p a share is in line with a “five-year growth policy” of payouts that rise in line with retail price inflation. The company has handed more than \u0026pound1billion to investors in the last four years alone. Meanwhile, the UK will swelter through another baking hot summer day today with temperatures hitting as high as 30 degrees in some parts of England.

It comes as five Supreme Court justices upheld rulings by a Family Court judge and Court of Appeal judges. Mrs Owens, 68, wants a divorce and says her marriage to Mr Owens, who is 80, is loveless and has broken down. She says he has behaved unreasonably and that she should not reasonably be expected to stay married. But a judge at an earlier hearing found Mrs Owens’ 27 examples of her husband \u0027being moody and argumentative\u0027 were \u0027flimsy and exaggerated.\u0027  Mr Owens has refused to agree to a divorce and denies Mrs Owens\u0027 allegations about his behaviour. He says if their marriage has irretrievably broken down it is because she had an affair, or because she is bored. Mr and Mrs Owens married in 1978 and lived in Broadway, Worcestershire, judges have heard. Mrs Owens petitioned for divorce in 2015 after moving out. Supreme Court justices analysed rival legal arguments, which revolved around concepts of unreasonable behaviour and fault, at a Supreme Court hearing in London in May and delivered a ruling on Wednesday. One, Lord Wilson, said justices had ruled against Mrs Owens with reluctance. He said the question for Parliament was whether the law governing entitlement to divorce remained satisfactory.  Lord Wilson indicated that Mrs Owens would be able to divorce in 2020, when the couple have been separated for five years. Another, Supreme Court president Lady Hale, said she found the case very troubling. But she said it was not for judges to change the law. Mrs Owens had already lost two rounds of the battle. In 2016 she failed to persuade a Family Court judge to allow her to divorce. Last year three appeal judges ruled against her after a Court of Appeal hearing in London. They said Mrs Owens had failed to establish that her marriage had, legally, irretrievably broken down and dismissed her challenge to a ruling by Judge Robin Tolson. One appeal judge said she reached her conclusion with no enthusiasm whatsoever but that Parliament would have to decide whether to introduce no fault divorce on demand.

Louise Sach, 28, had reached a stalemate in her search for a donor after being told her kidney function was starting to seriously deteriorate last year. In a last bid to find a match, Louise set up a Facebook page to see if she could attract a donor. The HR worker said she hoped an old friend or colleague might come forward. The last thing she expected was a complete stranger to give her the kidney she so badly needed. Incredibly, that\u0027s exactly what happened. Kayleigh Wakeling, 33, from Hertfordshire stepped forward and now the two are best friends.  Louise said: A year ago they told me I really needed to find a kidney. I never asked anyone. I didn\u0027t want to put anyone under undue pressure. I thought it might be a work college or someone I had met but didn\u0027t know I needed a kidney who came forward on Facebook. I never expected someone I had never met to offer. Kayleigh didn\u0027t have a particular reason that made her want to help me. She just saw something she could do to help someone else. She told me \u0027It just felt like the right thing to do and I knew I could do it.\u0027 Louise\u0027s last three potential donors tested negative for a match in September 2017, leaving her facing years of dialysis up to five times a week unless someone could be found. It was the news Louise had been dreading for 20 years since doctors found she was in renal failure aged eight and wouldn\u0027t make it through adulthood without a transplant.  I had now had all of my best friends and closest family tested, and we were left horrified and shocked at the news that, despite knowing for 20 years this time would come, the time had arrived, and I had no kidney donor she said. Louise was added to the deceased donor list but realised she could facing years of waiting lists, uncertainty and waiting to get \u0027the call\u0027. All the while having to rely on a dialysis machine to keep her alive, something she felt would cripple her life. Already in the last year she noticed a serious deterioration in her health and suffered severe cramps, nausea and would pass out. But Louise decided she wouldn\u0027t give up. It was two friends she met online and their stories that inspired her to turn her search online: Richie Sully and Lisa Emmott. Richie reached out online and gave his kidney to Rob Leibowitz, who hit headlines after he walked around Disneyland Florida wearing a t-shirt stating he needed a kidney Together with kidney awareness advocate Lisa, they helped Louise set up her Facebook page in January this year. Louise made a Facebook post talking about her struggle and how she urgently needed an O blood group kidney donor.

But for one teenager her love of Hot Cheetos went too far - and ended with her needing her gallbladder removed. That\u0027s according to her mother, who thinks her addiction had something to do with her health problems. Rene Craighead, 17, of Memphis, Tennessee, was reportedly eating four large bags of hot snacks a week when she began having stomach pain. She was taken to the hospital and underwent surgery to remove her gallbladder. Her mother, also called Rene, claims the doctor told her the flaming crisps were the root cause of her daughter\u0027s problem.  She told WREG-TV : When my daughter had to have this surgery I knew I had to tell everybody about it.  I was very surprised that my daughter was sick like that.   Rene reportedly would ask her mother to bring the snacks home with her and would take bags to school. According to the NHS, the gallbladder is a small organ in the upper right part of your tummy that stores bile and helps break down fatty foods. Surgery is usually needed if the patient develops painful gallstones. These can cause stomach pain, nausea and jaundice. An operation to remove a gallbladder is said to be routine and relatively straightforward - and you also don\u0027t need your gallbladder to survive. The makers of Cheetos told CBS News: At Frito-Lay, food safety is always our number one priority, and our snacks meet all applicable food safety regulations as well as our rigorous quality standards. Some consumers may be more sensitive to spicy foods than others and may choose to avoid spicier snacks due to personal preference.

Elin Ersson, 22, launched her solo protest onboard the aircraft, telling cabin crew she wouldn\u0027t sit down until the man facing deportation was removed from the plane. She won sympathy from fellow passengers during a tense standoff, but enraged some, including a man who appeared to be English and tried to snatch her phone as she live-streamed the ordeal on Facebook. An emotional Ms Ersson - called a hero on social media - defiantly told fellow travellers as she delayed the flight: It is not right to send people to hell ... What is more important? A life or your time?  While everyone else was seated, she said the 52-year-old man would face death if he was returned to his homeland, adding: “I don’t want a man’s life to be taken away just because you don\u0027t want to miss your flight. “I am not going to sit down until the person is off the plane.” Ms Ersson bought a ticket for the flight from Gothenburg, Sweden to Istanbul, Turkey after finding out that the asylum seeker was being deported on the plane.  She stopped the man from being kicked out of Sweden - albeit temporarily, it appears - but she could be jailed or fined over Monday\u0027s protest. The Gothenburg University student has won praise for her actions, but has also attracted criticism for interrupting the deportation and delaying the flight. Her video has been viewed more than two million times on Facebook. In the footage, she reminded flight attendants - who ordered her to sit down - and passengers that as long as she remained on her feet the plane couldn\u0027t leave its gate.  She added: I am doing what I can to save a person’s life. All I want to do is stop the deportation and then I will comply with the rules here. This is all perfectly legal and I have not committed a crime.” At one point, an angry man, who appeared to be English, tried to grab her mobile phone. She told him: “What is more important? A life or your time? I want him to get off the plane because he is not safe in Afghanistan.  I am trying to change my country’s rules, I don’t like them. It is not right to send people to hell.” Ms Ersson said the Afghan man would most likely get killed in his homeland, as other passengers joined the protest. Airline and airport officials decided not to use force to eject the woman and the standoff continued until the asylum seeker was taken off the plane, along with officers who were escorting him, amid a round of applause.  Ms Ersson then left the plane and went back inside the terminal after accomplishing what she had set out to do. Flight tracking websites show that the delayed flight arrived almost two hours behind schedule at Istanbul Atat\u0026uumlrk Airport. In Istanbul, the man was due to be placed on a flight to Kabul. The man, whose name wasn\u0027t revealed, remains in custody in Sweden, where authorities have said he will deported at a later date, Deutsche Welle reported.

A podcast news report promoting the city to tourists is being blamed for the misunderstanding after claiming the country was facing a ninja shortage.  The episode of Planet Money on National Public Radio suggested the small city of Iga, famed as the birthplace of the ninja, couldn\u0027t find enough martial artists to perform for tourists during its annual festival.  Sally Herships, who visited the city for an episode of NPR’s Planet Money, said: There’s a ninja shortage. Or, to be accurate, a ninja-performer shortage. It set off a frenzy of internet interest and even quoted potential salaries of around \u0026pound17,000 to \u0026pound65,000, giving the impression it might be hiring. That\u0027s wrong, all wrong, said Motoyoshi Shimai, an official of Iga\u0027s tourism strategy division. There was no discussion about that, and we didn\u0027t mention money.  Still, the city received volleys of telephone and email queries from 115 ninja wannabes in 23 countries, including Japan. Most were questions about whether we were really hiring, but there were a few that begged us to employ them and tried to promote themselves, Shimai added. Some had real confidence in their bodies and strength. Iga ultimately issued a statement in several languages saying it was not hiring and warning against fake news, but said plenty of other ninja fun was on offer.

However, there were so many laughs and great times had along the way and once they crossed the finish line, I know they were so glad they took part.

When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ad079a27c007.jpg ","title":"blow for arrogant brewdog as prized local pub sold to rival beer company","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe St Andrews bar that “arrogant” BrewDog founders declared as being their next pub has been sold – to a rival craft beer company.BrewDog announced plans to open bars in the Fife town and Perth at its AGM in front of 8,000 investors at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre in April.The presentation by BrewDog founders James Watt and Martin Dickie to their “equity for punks” investors identified Rascals Bar on North Street as the location of a BrewDog pub to open this year.However, Rascals owner Colin Donaldson denied that a deal had been done and called the Ellon-based brewer “arrogant” for the premature announcement.

I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

Many Lochee folk have raised the issue over recent years.“I hope as many people as possible have their say in the survey.“The old clock brings back memories and, like anything from our history, stirs up passionate opinions.“This survey is a way of ensuring every opinion is heard.”The city council said work would begin on a new clock in 2017 but it was instead put out to the public vote.The council had previously entered “detailed discussions” with the Lochee Regeneration Forum and agreed on a preferred design with members of the community.A post on the IYN Lochee Facebook page states: “We have prepared a very short survey (four questions) to get people’s views on the potential for installing a new clock on Lochee High Street.“For those who do not use social media, or internet, staff will be out and about with tablets and paper copies will be left in public buildings across the Lochee ward.“The survey will be open until the end of August.”Visit the IYN Facebook page to take part in the vote.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3e36d73b758-e1532432769198.jpg ","title":"within five minutesof meeting josh hewas your best friend he just loved life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee barman and student president described as “everyone’s friend” has died suddenly at the age of 27.Joshua Gregory, described as a “larger than life” 6ft 4in lad, was known among pals as a kind person who brought people together with his infectious laugh.He died of heart failure on Friday, leaving his parents, pals and girlfriend distraught but determined to ensure his legacy lives on.He won several awards in his time at D\u0026ampA College, where he also served as president of the students association.His mum, Paulette Mill, said her son had joined the ‘27 Club’ – the age at which many talented musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison died.She said: “He was just 27 – it’s almost like he was too talented. He played the guitar and drums, he’d been in pipe bands, tried to start up his own band, played piano and he could read music.“And he played basketball, he helped at the D\u0026ampA, he volunteered, he was an advocate for mental health, had finished his HND in petroleum engineering – he did everything.“He was a tall, broad guy, with a huge grin.“Everywhere he went, everybody knew he was coming.”Born in south-east London, Josh moved up to Scotland when he was still young and immediately set to work befriending everyone he met.Friend John King, who met Josh at D\u0026ampA College, said: “Within five minutes of meeting him he was your best friend.“He just loved life, being around everyone – and loved banter. Total banter, all the time.”Craig Nicoll, who works at the D\u0026ampA as a sports and wellbeing officer, said Josh was his “best friend” at both work and play.“He took what he did very seriously, and he was very good at it,” he said. “He could throw himself into anything.”“Last year one of the workers came in with a Santa costume for the kids at Christmas. We volunteered him for it – and he did it. You could depend on him. You could fill a novel with stories about him.”His girlfriend, Yvonne Nessel, said Josh had the rare ability to befriend everyone he met.She said: “He had friends everywhere – Dundee, Dunfermline – even people he hadn’t seen in years from school, and thousands on Facebook.“He had taken up fishing again a couple of weeks ago at Balmule Fishing Club and there’s already talk of them putting a plaque up there for him. After two weeks.”Paulette added: “Some people could be around for a year and you wouldn’t know them as well as you’d know him within two weeks.”The issue of mental health was one of great importance to Josh.However, he kept his own issues deeply private among only a handful of his closest friends – friends who said the happiness of others always came before his own.John added: “He was so focused on everyone else. It makes me sad, knowing that he could make so many people happy, but couldn’t make himself happy. But we always had his back.”Josh will be commemorated at a special 18+ event at Industry nightclub in Dundee, where he worked.The Friday night event, from 10pm, will play his favourite music and raise money for a trust in his name promoting positive mental health among men.Yvonne said: “It’s important for him to have a legacy. I think he would be so pleased that he could still help people now even when he physically can’t.”Funeral arrangements for Josh are yet to be finalised.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":null,"title":"number-of-pubs-closing-across-the-uk-each-week-revealed","story":"                          CLOSE to 1,300 pubs have been shut down or converted over the past year as the industry suffers amid unprecedented cost pressures."},{"url":null,"title":"aek-athens-await-in-champions-league-for-winners-of-celtic-v-rosenborg","story":"                          CELTIC will face AEK Athens in the Champions League third qualifying round if they progress past Rosenborg."},{"url":null,"title":"spfl-confirm-make-up-of-two-reserve-leagues-ahead-of-the-new-campaign","story":"                          THE SPFL have confirmed that two Reserve Leagues will operate during the 2018/19 campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"3m-makeover-for-former-glasgow-printworks","story":"                          A CITY centre office block built on the site of a former printworks is set for a \u0026pound3 million makeover.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-change-opening-hours-ruling-at-new-glasgow-harbour-site","story":"                          A MAJOR development at Glasgow Harbour is failing to attract new shop owners because of restrictive opening hours rules."},{"url":null,"title":"the-leading-contenders-for-the-201819-scottish-premiership-golden-boot","story":"                          Kris Boyd proved age is just a number with another prolific campaign in the Ladbrokes Premiership last season."},{"url":null,"title":"greggs-to-open-new-shop-in-east-ends-carmyle","story":"                          Greggs will create eight new jobs when it opens a new East End store this Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-fan-left-scarred-for-life-after-he-was-slashed-by-man-in-easterhouse-pub","story":"                          A KNIFE thug brutally slashed a Celtic fan who had earlier offered to buy him a drink."},{"url":null,"title":"style-service-is-a-scotland-first-for-ayrshire-opticians","story":"                          SPECTACLE wearers are set to be national style pioneers after an award-winning Ayrshire optometry group launched a new service."},{"url":null,"title":"tearful-five-year-old-creates-adorable-poster-of-lost-teddy-bear","story":"                          A TEARFUL five-year-old girl has made an adorable poster of her lost bear in a desperate bid to find it."},{"url":null,"title":"2018-european-championships-cycling-trial-glasgow-road-closures-in-place","story":"                          THOUSANDS of drivers and commuters are being warned to rethink travel plans ahead of a cycling event which will bring major roads to a standstill."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/ResizeCache/00125000/00125302-124x067.jpg","title":"Claims that electricity substation is affecting house values","story":"Residents in a remote Inverness-shire glen are challenging a power giant over a massive electricity substation that is expanding towards their homes.The 12 or so residents at Auchterawe near Fort Augustus fear their idyllic homes\u0026rsquo value has been slashed and the peaceful area blighted as the Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) substation expands to become one of the biggest around.\"From a tiny substation it is going to become an industrial site,\" said Steve Lanning who is leading the fight for compensation from SSE.\"For years SSE has been developing the small substation into what promises to become a huge facility. It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me. The other residents are my friends and we are all in the same boat.\"A spokeswoman from SSE said: \"Our proposal has been developed in close consultation with the local community and other stakeholders based on a range of economic, environmental and technical considerations.\u0026nbsp\"As a responsible developer, we have listened carefully to the feedback during consultation, and to minimise the visual impact of the extension, we are proposing a gas-insulated switchgear solution, which significantly reduces the footprint of the site.\"We have also purchased additional land to allow for enhanced screening and bunding to further mitigate the visual impact.\"We remain committed to working constructively with the local community.\"She added that there have been two public consultations, and SSE also facilitate a dedicated community\u0026nbspliaison group in the area where senior management and project teams are on hand to engage directly with residents to address any concerns raised.A detailed planning application has been lodged and a council planning decision is expected in September.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Our decision will take into account all

security staff is low while general staff safety has become an increasing concern at the north of Scotland\u0027 largest hospital.It is furious that the lengthy review of staff cover within the

process has so far cost taxpayers \u0026pound7808.34.It prompted her to ask: \"How many operations would that pay for?\"Ms Gordon said: \"The security staff cover a 32-acre site and have an increasingly challenging job.\"The statistics show that aggression and the threat of violence is escalating not diminishing.\"It\u0027 suspected that the board want to save money by getting security guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 1:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

They are a professional outfit and they won’t be taking us lightly.“It’s something we as a club need to try to do, try to compete and better teams that have bigger budgets than us.“We’ve done that and Burnley have done that and they’ve had a lot of coverage about what they’ve done.”He added: “It’s difficult to compare them to teams in Scotland because Celtic and Rangers have huge budgets as well.“Celtic have won the league comfortably but we have competed. And we’ve beaten Rangers in the last couple of seasons and they have a bigger budget than us.“I think Sean Dyche and the Burnley team have proven it’s not all about the size of the budget it’s about the players and hopefully we can show that ourselves.“We have a lot of belief in the team that we can do that.“The quality in the dressing room is enough that we’re confident we can get through the tie.”It is often said the game in Scotland is not rated highly by football observers in England and many are viewing this tie as a chance for Aberdeen to show Scottish football is better than some might think.Lewis, a former England squad keeper, had spent his whole career down south before joining the Reds two years ago.The former Peterborough, Cardiff, Blackpool and Fulham custodian has been on both sides of the divide.He believes it is hard to compare Scotland and England but he does think the tie gives the Dons a great opportunity to show how good they are and how good the Scottish Premiership is.Lewis said: “Before I came up here I didn’t follow a great deal of Scottish football.“But now having seen both sides of it I can see that they are very different.“The Championship in England is a very tough league and the Premier League is another kettle of fish.“It’s hard to compare the two because there are different obstacles and different mentalities required in the different leagues.“Down there sometimes you can go away to small grounds and there aren’t many fans and it’s as much a mental test as anything, can you deal with it?“Then here when you play the likes of Rangers, Celtic, Hibs and Hearts it’s a different situation.“It’s big crowds and can you produce in the high pressure situations? It’s difficult to compare and say what people think of the standard here.”He added: “But I have enjoyed playing up here immensely and this tie is a good chance to test ourselves against Burnley, showcase our skills and show what we’re about.“We have finished second in our league for the last four seasons.“There will be plenty of eyes watching the games and looking at exactly how good we are and how good Scottish football is.“Hopefully we can prove ourselves and show them what we are all about.”So far this summer Dons boss Derek McInnes has signed midfielders Chris Forrester, Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson, as well as Dominic Ball, who can play in defence or midfield.Tommie Hoban was brought in on a season-long loan this morning, while Lewis now has senior back-up \u0026#8211 with Tomas Cerny brought in on a one-year deal.Lewis believes the squad is shaping up nicely ahead of taking on Burnley.He said: “I’m sure the manager is still looking to bring players in.

We’ve got a very strong team and hopefully we can build on that.“It’s shaping up well and we’re enjoying ourselves.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"chairman milne calling on dons to make their mark for city and country","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPittodrie chairman Stewart Milne insists the Europa League clash with Burnley is a chance to show the strength of both Aberdeen and Scottish football.The Dons face the English Premier League Clarets in a second qualifying round first leg Battle of Britain at Pittodrie tomorrow.Milne accepts Scottish football will be under the microscope with the return leg next Thursday at Turf Moor set to be broadcast live by BT Sport.Burnley, who today arrived in the Granite City, finished seventh in the English top flight and are rated as favourites by bookmakers to progress to a third qualifying round clash with Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir.However, with the focus of British football on the tie, Milne claimed the Reds have the belief they can upset the odds.He said: “This is an opportunity to profile Aberdeen as a football club, and the Scottish game.“Nobody is underestimating the scale of the challenge that Burnley will pose.“However, equally it is a game where the belief will be there that we can go out and win it and get through into the next round.”The Euro double header heralds a high-profile and high- stakes beginning to Aberdeen’s campaign.Just days after the return at Turf Moor the Reds kick-off their domestic season with a Premiership clash against Rangers at Pittodrie on Sunday August 5.Milne said: “There is a lot at stake in those three initial games, particularly the European ones.“Derek (McInnes) feels it will be a big challenge but it is certainly not beyond us.“Hopefully we can get the right result.”Aberdeen have exited the Europa League at the third qualifying stage in the last four seasons.The Reds will have to despatch Burnley to match that this year and take a step closer to the target of the group stages – which brings a minimum £3 million payment.In the long term the Reds have ambitions to break into the UEFA top 100 club list. Delivering the £50 million stadium and training facilities at Kingsford are a key component to that.Aberdeen broke ground on the £10m training ground earlier this month.Milne said: “It (training ground) is a big part of the jigsaw although there are a lot of things we can do to make sure we become a top 100 club.“Fundamental to the whole thing is having the right facilities and keeping that momentum going on the football front.“We have got to grow in strength in the club itself and be able to generate a lot more money as the club moves forward.“Having a facility like that just underpins the whole club.“It would be very difficult for us to be part of whatever the European future is going to be without having top class facilities like that.”Dons boss McInnes has secured six new signings this summer in preparation for the Euro tilt – Stephen Gleeson, Chris Forrester, Lewis Ferguson and Tomas Cerny on permanents and Dominic Ball on loan from Rotherham and Tommie Hoban on loan from Watford.He aims to have more new additions on board for the Rangers clash with his main priority being a striker.McInnes also wanted to further strengthen his squad for the clash with Burnley.He had a bid for Doncaster striker John Marquis, understood to be £250,000, rejected.It is understood that move is not completely dead in the water and could yet be revisited.Aberdeen also reportedly had a bid of £300,000 for Preston striker Eoin Doyle fall through because the 30-year-old could not agree personal terms.The Reds could yet launch a loan bid for Preston striker Louis Moult, who they attempted to sign from Motherwell last summer.The Dons lost out to League One Sunderland in the race to land Scotland international midfielder Dylan McGeouch.McInnes was also keen on securing Ross County full-back Jason Naismith but he opted to join Peterbrough United, also of League One.But McInnes insists despite the hurdles he has to overcome in the transfer market, his squad will be competitive against the Clarets.McInnes said: “We’ve lost out on several players to League One already this season and I don’t think that should be the case.“A lot of the reasons are financial for players and unfortunately there are clubs who surpass what we can do.“But that’s always been the case, and we’ve always managed to put a competitive squad

the Reds book a flight to Turkey to face Istanbul Basaksehir in the third qualifying round.Wright missed the draw for the second qualifying round as he was flying back from a holiday in the Middle East.When the Aberdonian touched down after an eight-hour journey he switched on his phone and the text pinged – the Reds had drawn Burnley.It may not be overseas but Wright accepts the tie against the English Premier League side is still high profile.And he is determined to land a blow for the reputation of Scottish football.He said: “Landing Burnley in Europe is a huge game and we aim to show Burnley and everyone what we can do.“We have competed in Europe over the last couple of years and are certainly not going to be slouches.“We will be right up for the game.“When the draw was made I was on a flight at the time back from a holiday in Dubai with my girlfriend.“When we landed I got a text saying we had drawn Burnley.“Obviously it is not overseas but it is an exciting tie – Europe always is.”Burnley were today set to arrive in the Granite City ahead of their first match in Europe for 51 years.The Clarets secured their Europa League spot courtesy of a seventh-placed finish in the English top flight that also brought £198 million in Premier League payments.Wright admits he is more used to seeing Burnley in action on Match of the Day on a Saturday night.However, the Clarets’ position in the richest league in the world, beamed to billions worldwide, will not faze Wright or his team-mates.He said: “You watch Burnley on Match of the Day every weekend but you have to put that to the side.“Ultimately it is just another game and Burnley are just another bunch of boys.“We are all going to be confident going into the tie and hopefully we can get a good result over both legs.”Although Dyche’s Clarets have the superior spending power the Dons have the edge in European experience.Aberdeen are set to embark on a fifth successive Europa League campaign under Derek McInnes while Burnley last played competitive continental football in the 1966-67 season.The Clarets have opted not to train at Pittodrie tonight ahead of the tie and did their work at Turf Moor this morning.“Burnley have to come to Pittodrie for the first game but I don’t think they will take us lightly,” said Wright.The Dons have exited the Europa League at the third qualifying round in each of the previous four seasons – to Apollon Limassol last year, Maribor (2016), Kairat Almaty (2015) and Real Sociedad (2014).The group stages and a basic payment in excess of £3m is the reward but the Reds will have to knock out Burnley to even replicate the level of previous seasons.Wright is relishing the challenge.He said: “It is a great time to be at Aberdeen.“These are exciting times as we have a couple of huge games against Burnley coming up.“There is also the game against Rangers to start the league so there is plenty to look forward to.“However, we just have to take it game by game and see where it takes us. That is all we can do.”Wright has played his way into contention to face Burnley tomorrow after an impressive pre-season. The winger was taken off in the 1-1 draw with West Brom after being kicked.Boss Derek McInnes confirmed Wright is fully fit and only took him off as a precautionary measure.Wright missed pre-season last year having sustained a hamstring injury during the Toulon Tournament in France while on international duty with the Scotland Under-20s.This summer he was again at the Toulon Tournament but returned fully fit after Scotland reached the semi-finals.He said: “All I can do is keep my head down in training, work hard and hopefully I will get the opportunity to show what I can do.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen skateboard company aims to create lasting legacy in doric","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDoric Skateboards hope to bring a sense of community to the skate scene in Aberdeen.The online retailer, which entered this year’s Evening Express Retailer Awards, hopes to scoop top spot in the Specialist Retailer category.Owner Gary Kemp launched Doric Skateboards in March 2017.Gary, who got his first skateboard when he was just eight years old, aims to create a skateboard brand the north-east can be proud of.He is heavily influenced by Aberdeen, its buildings and history.Gary – who also works for Optimus Aberdeen as project controls manager – said: “My inspiration comes from the city and everything I have soaked up over my life.“I was raised to have an interest in the history of Aberdeen and it has stuck with me.”The creative owner, who loves “interacting with customers and getting a new design kicked off”, would describe his business as “friendly, inclusive and determined”.To Gary, excellent customer service is all about “engagement, availability and being more than a standard set answer”.The businessman is a big fan of clean, symmetrically pleasing design.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery.

Donald Clark from The George said: ‘It’s good on games’ day to see so many well-kent faces and to see new faces doing well in the games.’Once face missing from the games this year was the Duke himself he and his family are currently in India celebrating his 50th birthday.The honour of chieftain of the games was given to Rear Admiral John Weale OBE RASM, FOSNI, ACNS(SM) who heads the Royal Navy in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Amongst the guests this year was a contingent of members of the German branch of the Clan Campbell Society.More than 4,000 people attended the games the numbers held up well against other years and the visitors were rewarded with fine weather.They saw two records broken on the track this year: Jax Thoirs from Glasgow set a new open ground record for the long jump at 21 ft 7 inches and Aiden Quinn of Glasgow took the open hop, step and jump to 47ft 2½ inches.Numbers entering the solo piping contests were, like many other games, slightly down.

Six-year-old Saul Wylie has been told medics in the UK won’t treat his severe form of cerebral palsy. But \u0026pound80,000 will open the doors to pioneering treatment from the world’s top surgeon in America. Now a huge community effort is hoping to send Saul on his way to a better life. The brave twin – who was born weighing just 1lb – faces gruelling treatment and rehab which docs at home will not back. But parents Karen and Stuart have launched a ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign that they hope will put him on the plane. Karen, 39, said: “Saul has been a fighter from day one and wasn’t even supposed to be here. “We were told to terminate him in order to give his brother a better chance of survival, but that was never an option. “He then spent most of his first year in hospital because he was born so fragile. “He’s just used to things being against him.” Saul, of Tarbolton, suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy, where he sits at grade four on a scale of five. At present, doctors in this country will only treat children until stage three. But surgery in St Louis, Missouri is available that could give Saul a whole new lease of life. Karen revealed: “We feel guilty appealing for so much money, but the reality is that’s what it will take for this treatment. “Saul would face two operations to take away bad nerves and lengthen his legs – and the rehab would be long and intensive. “He has regressed so much in the last couple of years, as before he used to be able to stand with the aid of his walker. “It will only get worse and more painful unless he gets the help he needs.” Saul, who is looking forward to starting life at Tarbolton Primary next month, has already been backed by more than \u0026pound25,000 of fundraising. Dad Stuart said: “We’ve been blown away by the support so far. “Saul is very well known around the village and people have been so kind and eager to help. “We have a number of events planned and we just hope we can make this a reality.” To learn more about the campaign, visit https://www.justgiving/campaigns/charity/just4children/stepsforsaulLike us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsCerebral palsyCharity"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Thirty of the 32 Scottish local authorities have at least one Citizens Advice Scotland centre. But South Ayrshire is believed never to have had the help and rights championing service. Inverclyde is the only other area which does not have a CAB. Now a summit has been staged within Ayr County Buildings to state a case for having the service here. The steering group of councillors met on July 12 and one source said: “There is a definite anomaly here and the question should be asked why there is not a citizens advice bureau here. “I believe need has never been greater, with increasing consumer debt and other problems.” Councils have a duty to provide the advice, but South Ayrshire Council use their own staff to give it. They work out of the Wallace Tower in Ayr, but critics insist that because they are not independent, the advice cannot be of supreme impartiality. The source added: “Often people are coming in to say they cannot pay council tax or rent. “So far from being not involved, the Council is in fact the creditor. “A push is on to finally set up a proper service for the people of South Ayrshire. “There are a lot of odd things about the South Ayrshire model, not least who is informing it on a national basis. “It is a mystery why South Ayrshire Council should or can be operating an advice centre. “They are conflating advice with information.” Citizens Advice Scotland is a registered charity, helping 300,000 people a year from a total of 61 centres. It is often a place of last resort for people having difficulties in their lives, including being weighed down by debt. And the organisation also lobbies for change in government policy where it has identified hardship being caused. All local Citizens Advice Bureaux are managed by an independent board of directors and all bureaux are members of Citizen’s Advice Scotland.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

And Prestonpans Labour Club, which Walter was a member of, has also joined in with recent fundraisers, helping it donate more than \u0026pound1,400 to Pancreatic Cancer Scotland.  Mattie Edmond, club steward, handed over a cheque for \u0026pound1,410 to Fiona Brown and Alison Clancy from the charity after they hosted Pancreatic Cancer Scotland following two events on Easter Sunday and a show with the Jersey Beats organised by Pete Barrie with support from the Prestonpans Hearts Supporters Club.

Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

The other is a giant stainless steel mussel shell, depicting Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history, which was recently put in place at Murdoch Green.  Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

That performance did not come out of the blue \u0026ndash it was the culmination of many years of learning from others and pure hard work.  \u0026ldquoThe week after his victory in Blackpool, he returned to where he started at Inch Park, resplendent in his national champion\u0026rsquos jersey, to meet and inspire our younger riders.  \u0026ldquoHe became a hero figure for many of our Go-Ride members, and some of the coaches too.  The club added: \u0026ldquoThe response on social media to his loss reflects the regard in which he was held. He will be greatly missed by the cycling community in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe pay tribute to his many achievements in his short life and extend our condolences to his parents, Keith and Margaret, sister Emma and girlfriend Hannah.  Scottish Cycling posted on Twitter: \u0026ldquoWe are saddened to hear of the sudden death of Ben Forsyth, a former British youth champion and who at only 20 years of age had so much to live for.  \u0026ldquoOur thoughts are with his family and friends.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

He told the Courier how the drastic change in career came about: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a PT people used to come to me and ask for a diet plan or a training plan.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod say \u0026lsquohave you had one of these before?\u0026rsquo and they\u0026rsquod tell me they\u0026rsquod had seven or eight.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.

Her dad Stan mounted the first major expedition to the caves, in the Andes Mountains in the east of the country, alongside astronaut Neil Armstrong in 1976.  Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Such is the demand for Scots products, the Chinese even have their own names for Highland Games, strongman kilty party, baa baa pudding, haggis and malt whisky which they cryptically call Trail Fragrant Liqueur Lane. Now as the Chinese spending power grows, wealthy tourists are being offered bespoke tours which are aimed at boosting visitor numbers, as well as selling more to China.  Chinese visitor numbers to the UK are expected to rise by almost 50% - from 260,000 to 384,000 - over the next five years, VisitBritain predicts.  Scotland currently accounts for almost one fifth (17%) of all of those coming to the UK from the country.  VisitScotland says the rise in visitors from China is expected to be driven by the young adult traveller, saying \u0026ldquomillennials are seen as a growing target market.  New figures show how important Chinese tourists are becoming to the Scottish economy. Spending by Chinese tourists increased by 414% between 2007 and 2016, from \u0026pound7 million to \u0026pound36 million.  Over the same period the number of Chinese visitors to Scotland increased by 192% 41,000 visits were recorded in 2016.  Pernod Ricard is targeting the country\u0026rsquos younger generation and its expanding middle classes who have higher disposable incomes.  More than 750 Chinese tourists will land later this week for a four-day tour that will see them immerse themselves in all aspects of Scottish culture.  They will visit the most famous whisky region of Speyside where they will tour the Strathisla Distillery, the world-renowned Glenlivet Distillery which was the first licensed one in the area and then Aberlour.  The visitors will also be invited to don kilts and sashes at a Highland dinner where they will have the opportunity to taste some of the best Scotland has to offer. Other excursions will include a trip to Loch Ness to try to spot the famous monster and no trip to Scotland would be complete without a visit to a football match and the group will take part in a tournament at Inverness Caledonian Thistle\u0026rsquos stadium.  The trip is part of a drive to improve sales in the vast Communist state with the country representing more than half of the global whisky trade with 25 bottles of Scotch exported to China every minute.  Neil MacDonald, Brand Experience Director, Chivas Brothers, said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to be able to host our colleagues from China and show them all the wonderful sights and industries we have to offer here in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoVisiting the birthplace of our brands and becoming immersed in their craftsmanship and heritage really is the best way to understand what makes each of them unique.  \u0026ldquoThe experiences that our Chinese colleagues have in Scotland, the people they meet, the Scottish celebrations and being at our distilleries will fuel their personal story-telling to colleagues, consumers and trade back in China.  \u0026ldquoThis creates even stronger opportunities for our brands and Scotch whisky as a whole.  \u0026ldquoChina is a very important market for us, and we expect its significance will only continue to grow over the coming years.  \u0026ldquoBy fostering even stronger ties with our colleagues, we\u0026rsquore confident this trip will help us build on our solid partnership for the future.  It comes as the number of visitors travelling to the UK from China is expected to soar from fewer than 500 in 1996 to almost 500,000 by 2026, a report from VisitBritain states.  Chinese tourists spent more than \u0026pound513 million in the UK last year, but the figure is set to rise sharply.  Visits abroad have more than doubled in five years, from about 41 million overnight stays in 2011 to 85 million by 2016. By 2020 it is forecast to exceed 110 million trips overseas, In Scotland, visitor numbers have been boosted by the popularity of whisky, which has resulted in a surge of visits to distilleries.  The number of visitors to Scotland\u0026rsquos distilleries reached an all-time high of 1.7 million in 2016, an increase of 8% on the previous year, and the Scotch Whisky Association recognises the Chinese influx played a part in this increase.  Research shows the average age of Chinese visitors to the UK is younger than the average age of inbound travellers.  In 2016, half of Chinese visitors were aged 25-44 and it is estimated that 60% were aged 18 to 34.  Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness are known to be the favourite locations in Scotland for Chinese travellers to visit.  A growing number of Chinese have an estimated \u0026pound20million or more in liquid financial assets who are below the age of 30.  Whisky sales in China leapt in 2017 with imports of 17.4 million litres, representing a year-on-year growth of 19.5%.  Whisky is the third most popular alcoholic drink among Chinese people, with consumption growing more than 83% over the past five years."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2275658.jpg?type=article-full","title":"estate-agents-latest-casualties-on-the-high-street","story":"  But just as those businesses have slowly retreated from formerly vibrant town centres, it now appears that estate agents are following suit.  New research has found that failures among property businesses are on the rise in the UK, with more than 50 going bust each year in Scotland since 2013.  Across the border the situation is even worse, with 2,446 estate agents in England and Wales closing their doors during the same time frame as they come under pressure from rising costs and competition from the internet, according to research by property management firm DJ Alexander.  And it may be that office-based estate agents are going for good, with researchers finding \"generational\" shift in the way people look for property.    David Alexander, managing director of DJ Alexander Ltd, explained: \"For most people under 40-years-old, the idea of wandering from shop to shop in city centres\u0026rsquo is alien to them and they conduct many of their purchases on their phones, tablets, or computers.  \"This situation is only likely to continue, and we can see that High Street outlets such as estate agents are suffering as a result and will continue to suffer over the next few years.  \"Online competition has had a dramatic impact on the High Street with its lower cost base and its generational and cultural shift from on street to online shopping.  \"The internet has undercut much of the High Street in the retail and other sectors over the last five years and this is likely to continue.  The research covers a period when exclusively online estate agents such as Purple Bricks became established, proving that the model does work.    By cutting out bricks-and-mortar premises and handling everything electronically, firms such have these have been able to cut costs while serving clients needs, Mr Alexander said.  He added: \"The loss of the High Street estate agent does not mean less service, in fact it means more, with a greater focus on the needs of the client.  \"The online client is simply using a different method of accessing the housing market, but their demands remain as high, if not higher, than before.  \"But the market remains buoyant for those offering clients an up to date online service fully catering for all their needs from initial advice, consulting, managing, advertising, and promoting with their key legal and financial needs met.  \"It is a brave new world but one in which estate agency will continue to exist but not in the way it has in the past and these failures are a sign that there will be closures along the way as the market adjusts.  Gavin Mochan, Sales Director for s1Homes, said that the rise of online estate agents had gathered pace in recent years.  He said: \"Initially, when online portals came to pass the pure online agent seemed inconceivable given some of the key ingredients were missing.  \"A great example of a missing fundamental was data. Back then finding out how much your house was worth was reliant on the local knowledge of your estate agent and the process was purely physical.  \"These days portals such as s1homes can tell you the purchase price of every house in the street giving you very credible estimates.\"  However, he said that the estate agents who are doing best are those who have developed a hybrid approach using both an online and a physical presence.  Andrew Perratt, Head of Residential Property at Savills in Scotland agrees, saying that even with their wide-reaching work on the web, there is little substitute for a face-to-face meeting.

Critics have branded SUAT donations \u0026ldquodark money.  The SNP\u0026rsquos Pete Wishart has written to the commission to enquire about the extent of the SUAT\u0026rsquos property portfolio, which, he suggested, could disbar it from being a permissible donor.  The backbench MP has called on Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, to reveal if any of the SUAT donations were used in the 2017 General Election campaigns of Tory MPs John Lamont, David Duguid and Douglas Ross, all of whom took seats from sitting Nationalist candidates last year.  Asked on the BBC\u0026rsquos Good Morning Scotland programme if SUAT cash was used to fight seats in the General Election, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Conservatives have registered and appropriately declared and set out all the funding they have received from the SUAT and all other sources of funding.  The Scottish Secretary made clear he had not personally received cash from the SUAT and stressed that he was confident that all money received during his time in politics had been \u0026ldquoappropriately declared and that the Scottish Conservatives had followed the rules \"assiduously\" if anyone had evidence to the contrary, they should take it to the commission, he added.  But Mr Wishart insisted Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos responses had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation over whether or not the Scottish Tories had \u0026ldquoused dark money in last year\u0026rsquos General Election to bankroll campaigns in key target seats.  The Perth MP went on: \"Transparency over party financing is absolutely essential in any healthy democracy the public need to have a clear understanding of who helped put their elected representatives into office.  \"As each day passes, more and more questions are piling up for the Scottish Tories it is time for Ruth Davidson to break her silence and answer the questions that her colleagues are refusing to answer.  \"Was dark money used in last year\u0026rsquos election campaign? And if it was, are the Tories satisfied that the election expense returns of John Lamont, David Duguid and Douglas Ross were correctly completed? And have David Mundell\u0026rsquos own election campaigns received money that originated from SUAT over the years?\"  He added: \"The Electoral Commission needs to use its powers to crack down on rule-breaking, cheating and dark money.

Jennie Formby, Labour\u0026rsquos General Secretary, has written to the backbencher, telling her she faced investigation for \"abusive conduct\" and that \"any further behaviour of a similar nature\" could result in disciplinary action.  Mr McDonnell pointed out how Dame Margaret\u0027s outburst was \"out of character\" and she was \"extremely angry and lost her cool\" when she confronted Mr Corbyn.  \"Of course, he was upset Margaret was upset as well,\" he explained. \u0026ldquoJeremy was deeply upset because, when you have someone haranguing you in that way, of course it\u0027s upsetting. Those sorts of accusations, when he has worked so hard on the issues of anti-Semitism and anti-racism, of course he\u0027s upset.\"  The Shadow Chancellor said later interviews had shown Dame Margaret\u0027s concern had been based on a misunderstanding of the code agreed by Labour\u0027s ruling National Executive Committee.  \"I realised there was a complete misinterpretation of the code, so I can understand why she was so angry if that\u0027s what she believed this code had done. It\u0027s a complete misunderstanding and we can resolve this amicably and move on.\"  Mr McDonnell said Mr Corbyn agreed that the case should be settled swiftly rather than subjected to the full disciplinary process.  \"At the weekend I spoke to Jeremy and said we\u0027ve got to resolve this matter quickly,\" explained the London MP. \"He said, yes, we\u0027ve got to do that, and he\u0027s asked the Chief Whip and General Secretary to try to sort this out. We want it resolved amicably and that can be done.\"  He stressed that neither he nor Mr Corbyn could get involved in the disciplinary process overseen by Ms Formby and Nick Brown, the Chief Whip.  And he said he did not know who had initially reported Dame Margaret\u0027s behaviour, saying only that \"a range of complaints came in\".  On Monday, Labour MPs agreed to stage a vote in September on whether to accept the new code, which has come under fire because its list of anti-Semitic behaviours omits a number of examples included by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.  The party insists that the examples, mostly relating to criticism of the state of Israel, are dealt with elsewhere in the document.  Mr McDonnell said it would be \"mistaken\" to think that Mr Corbyn\u0027s long association with pro-Palestinian campaigns should raise questions about his commitment to fighting anti-Semitism.  After initially stumbling over his words and describing Labour as \"a party that is anti-racist and anti-Semitist\", he told the BBC\u0026rsquos Today programme: \"We are against anti-Semitism, we are a party that attacks anti-Semitism wherever it is, either in our party or in our community.  \"We are going to tackle this and we will lead that campaign to ensure that Jewish people are respected and feel safe within our community.  \"Jeremy is as committed to that as anyone else within our party and anyone else within our community,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"expansion for young entrepreneur joss","story":"        A young entrepreneur has announced an expansion of his holistic crystals business with a move to a new location twice the size of the previous premises.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 1:48 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 1:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 1:49 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Wick River green slime passed safe for canines","story":"THE Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has allayed fears that an algae that has appeared on the surface of Wick River is harmful.Dog walkers in Wick had voiced concerns about the \u0026ldquogreen slime following the poisoning death of a dog by blue-green algae in the River Conon in Ross-shire last week.A spokesman from Sepa said that officers had confirmed the presence of enteromorpha in Wick River.\u0026ldquoEnteromorpha is a type of green algae\u0026nbspwhich, unlike blue-green algae, is not harmful.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work. We have got to do a new support leg for the bridge.\"But the funding allows us to forge ahead with the things we need to do. It\u0026rsquos not a fix for everything, because we have concrete which is now over 100 years old and is past the end of its useful life. However, it\u0026rsquos important for us to preserve everythng we can.\"All of the help and funding we have received will give us a more modern harbour that is safer.

After that we are embarking into major works which will require more extensive funding.\"Mr Vandyke says the local community has played a major role in helping to secure the future of Cromarty Harbour, which has existed in some form for over 200 years.He added: \"We would like to thank the community because their support has been so strong. The harbour has been there for 200 hundred years.

And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 1:50 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 1:50 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaWednesday 25 Jul 2018 1:50 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773591.1532519116!/image/image.jpg","title":"man with narcolepsy spends hundreds on shopping while asleep","story":"        A man with a brain disorder says he is locked in a \u0026#8220nightmare\u0026#8221 that sees him spend hundreds of pounds on shopping -- while he\u0026#8217s asleep.                Mark Doyle suffers from narcolepsy -- a rare brain disorder that causes him to suddenly fall asleep at any time.            One of the symptoms of the illness is ‘automatic behaviour’ which means Mark can carry out everyday tasks such as cleaning, cooking and shopping while fast asleep.            Mark, 46, from Neilston, East Renfrewshire, looks wide awake to others but is in fact fast asleep and completely unaware of what he’s doing.The dad-of-four has suffered from the brain disorder all his life and two weeks ago Mark had an episode at the Savers store in Barrhead’s Main Street, Glasgow.It saw him spent more than £120 on toiletries including shavers, bath sponges, and deodorant.He said: “When I woke up I noticed that I spent more than £100 on so many things like deodorant, bath sponges, shower gel, hair wax, you name it.“On July 13, I went and purchased £78.49 worth of toiletries which I didn’t need.            “The following day I went back in to return the products but I took a turn again, fell asleep and I tried to buy more stuff - about £80 worth.“But luckily I couldn’t find my card so the staff had to take all the other items back.“I went again the same day and bought £26 worth of stuff.READ MORE: Body cream helps insomniacs get to sleep            “I was in the shop that day four times.“At the start, my turns would last me for about 5-10 mins every day but now they are lasting as long as half an hour and to me that’s dangerous.“I can’t afford to be doing this anymore, I don’t have that kind of money to spend.”Last week Mark tried to take the toiletries back but says staff refused to reimburse the items worth £78.49 -- despite him having the receipt.He said: “I tried to explain my condition but they were not having it. I don’t get how they can let me return the other items but not that other receipt.            “They just told me that it’s not their problem it’s mine.“I just hate the way I’ve been treated. Younger people disrespect me and they just think I’m stupid but I’m not.He said: “I have never been able to secure a job if I am being honest. My last job I was working as a barman and I was collecting glasses.“But I had to leave that because of this.“I once took a turn in Morrisons and bought six chickens, six cans of dog food and 12 packets of cat food -- although I don’t have pets.“I took it back an hour later when I woke up, luckily, one of the members of staff knew someone with the same condition.Mark says although he suffers from this brain disorder he is not letting it bring him down.He added: “You just don’t remember your actions very well. When I talk to someone while sleeping, sometimes it’s like I am speaking a different language.READ MORE: Should UK legalise cannabis for medicinal use?“It just doesn’t make sense. I want to raise awareness. I believe I am on this planet for a reason.“I’m actually happy and I’m a fun guy.”Mark was diagnosed with the disorder when he was 11-years-old.He said: “School was torcher for me, teachers thought I should go to a disability school because I struggled to pay attention.“But they didn’t realise that although I looked wide awake, I was actually asleep. They didn’t understand that but my mum did.“You are not in control at all, it’s a nightmare. I wouldn’t be able to tell you when it’s going to happen it just happens.“I could be talking to someone face-to-face and I’ll fall asleep, even when I’m on the phone, the phone would just drop on the ground while I take another turn.“I bump my head, fall down, get black eyes and end up in hospital, all sorts.“I’ve got stains all over my carpet because of this and I’ve fallen asleep in buses and ended up in Ayr or Kilmarnock because I’ve missed my stop.”According to experts at the Narcolepsy UK charity, the condition is estimated to affect around one in 2,500 people.That means in the UK, there are approximately 30,000 people who have the disorder.Nicola Rule, from the charity, said: “Automatic behaviour and mico sleep are not only hard to explain to others but are very hard to live with, as they are unpredictable and invisible to the sufferer and onlookers.“It is really not at all that unusual for people with narcolepsy to suffer from the same problems as Mark.“Even going shopping at night on the websites can be an involuntary action.”The most common symptoms of narcolepsy are excessive daytime sleepiness, brought on by an irresistible need to sleep at inappropriate times during the day.Many sufferers also experience cataplexy -- a temporary involuntary loss of muscle control."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773551.1532519070!/image/image.jpg","title":"alexander mccall smith should there be second referendums on brexit and independence","story":"        Fundamental constitutional change should only happen when it\u0026#8217s the settled will of the people, writes Alexander McCall Smith.

Nobody needs to be reminded that since 2014 we have had two highly divisive referendums (we are also divided on whether the plural is referendums or referenda – an issue that has probably split families and broken friendships just as the referendums themselves have done.) Some people take the view that neither of those referendums should have been held. That strikes me as being a somewhat undemocratic view: both of the issues involved were matters of fundamental constitutional significance, and it is quite right that the electorate should be sounded out for its views.READ MORE: New series of novels set in Sweden for Alexander McCall SmithHowever, a referendum provides a snapshot – it does not necessarily provide a settled view. Electorates are fickle and might register a protest vote in a referendum. They might also change their mind, particularly when the consequences of their earlier vote are graphically revealed to them. This means that result of referendums do not necessarily reflect the views that an electorate might have held with any consistency over a long period of time. And it is exactly that sort of view that we need to ascertain – a settled, long-term commitment to a particular position. The difficulty with these two referendums we have had is that they addressed issues on which the population appears to be fairly equally divided. A majority was achieved for one view in each case, but it was not an overwhelming, knock-out majority. It was assumed, though, in each case that the referendum was to be decisive and was not to be repeated shortly thereafter. In Scotland that fact was specifically acknowledged by all parties. However, the referendum as a means of deciding matters in that clear and conclusive way does not seem to have worked.             In each case – that of Scottish independence and European Union membership – there are large sections of the population who do not think that the referendums in question should be the last word on the subject. As a result, a substantial proportion of the population is disaffected. We have become a markedly divided society – not one that is at ease with itself. Part of the reason for this is that we wandered into these referendums without thinking about whether a single referendum was really the solution we wanted it to be. Both these referendums were conceived of by some as being a way of telling some people to shut up.Currently it is the Brexit issue that most starkly reveals the problems of a single snapshot referendum. But is there a solution? Yes, dare one suggest that all referendums should be repeated after, say, five years have elapsed. The first referendum would decide nothing – people would really have to mean it, and vote accordingly in the second referendum, in order to make fundamental constitutional change. That would mean that a settled, long-term view could emerge, giving a result that nobody could argue with. It could be a concomitant of such a system that no referendum on the issue in question could then legally be held for at least 20 years. Of course people would argue that this merely prolongs uncertainty, but would it? What have we had over the last few years but crippling uncertainty?             But before supporters of a second referendum on Brexit or independence agree too loudly, the next referendums on these issues would have to be treated as the first in the new system, and therefore subject to repetition in five years’ time. They won’t like that, but fairness would require it. It would also give us much-needed breathing space.This column first featured in our sister title iNews."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773314.1532458728!/image/image.jpg","title":"ayesha hazarika on brexit tories tell lies and corbyn sells unicorns","story":"        The Tories are telling lies while Corbyn has a bridge with unicorns to sell you, writes Ayesha Hazarika                Westminster is smoking hot.

Government ministers, advisers and the civil service haven’t had the bandwidth to focus on the rather difficult day job of running the country since David Cameron called the EU referendum because the toxic politics of the campaign took over. Ironically for a campaign which was dominated by the slogan “take back control”, domestic British politics has spun out of control. We have huge problems the length and breadth of these shores which need the best brains, focus, hard-work, determination and good faith – from funding gaps in the NHS to the lack of opportunities for young people to housing and infrastructure – and sadly our most of our leading politicians seem to be woefully lacking all these qualities.The Conservatives are the equivalent of a circular firing squad and are so busy fighting over Brexit and jostling for who will succeed Theresa May, who will be out the door faster than you can say “strong and stable” once some deal is done on Brexit – although, her words “no deal is better than a bad deal” are proving to be rather prophetic. READ MORE: David Mundell: There’s no alternative to the Brexit White Paper            A ‘no deal’ and crashing out of the EU on WTO terms is now a growing prospect. If this happens, it won’t be because the EU won’t accept a deal, it will be because hard-right Tory Brexiteers won’t. After Chequers, she sent Ministers out on the airwaves to say that this was the absolute, final Cabinet position, then the very next day she gave in to Jacob Rees-Mogg. With this kind of the steel, I bet the EU are sh****** themselves. She then conceded that she would have to probably give way to the EU on further areas, which is true but how do you think the hard-right in her party are going to take those concessions? They are emboldened, and they will not give way. They never have. Ever since the days of John Major, who was out over the weekend calling for a second referendum.I am much more sympathetic to this notion now, but it won’t magic away all the problems – it would simply unblock the Brexit impasse we have in Parliament. What would the question or indeed questions be? How many options would have you have? Would you even include the option to overturn the decision and remain in the EU or would that be seen as undemocratic and unfair? And remainers like me might get a nasty shock – a second referendum may deliver an even bigger margin for leave because, if people hated Westminster in the run-up to the referendum, you can bet your bottom dollar they would want to give it an even bigger two-fingers after two years of arsing around.But it may be the only option if politics can’t find a way though. To give you an idea of how messed up the Government’s Brexit plans are, yesterday it was announced that the Brexit Department will no longer be negotiating Brexit. You literally could not make this stuff up.READ MORE: Food safety controls under threat from no-deal Brexit            Speaking of which, a special mention must go to Vince Cable, leader of the Lib Dems who last week managed to miss a critical vote on Brexit because he was allegedly at a dinner discussing setting up a new party to stop Brexit. Former leader Tim Farron also missed this important vote because he was busy making a speech about homosexuality and the church. It’s great to see the political titan whose only contributions to the last general election was the phrase “smell my spaniel” and a massive row about gay sex is back out there on his “it’s a sin” tour.But things took a more sinister twist when the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, was swindled out of her vote at a knife-edge moment because the Tories basically lied to her. She has just had a baby and is still on maternity leave. Julian Smith, the Tory Chief Whip, promised she would be “paired” with MP Brandon Lewis during a crucial Brexit vote. This is an arrangement where if an MP is sick or they can’t be in parliament for an important vote, their “pair” from the opposing party agrees not to vote so that they cancel each other out. It’s based on trust and honour ... Lewis then broke that promise and voted. This is outrageous. The Tories are saying this was an innocent mistake. Do me a favour. We weren’t born yesterday like Swinson’s baby! Lewis and Smith clearly lied, and should be sacked. It’s polite to give up your seat for a pregnant woman – they should be made to give up theirs. Permanently. What a low moment for politics.And don’t look to Labour for any comfort on Brexit. Yesterday Corbyn showed his true Eurosceptic heart by making a speech where he tried to sell us the economic “benefits” of Brexit, which got praised to the rafters by the Leave campaign. He also has a massive bridge to sell you, with a unicorn waiting for each and every one of you on the other side. So, the chances of Labour blocking Brexit or backing a second referendum or a ‘people’s vote’ are pretty slim. Mind you. They have bigger fish to fry right now. Like picking the mother of all rows with the Jewish community over anti-semitism and trying to make communism fashionable again.I really do despair. Never have we needed better politics.

Shocking, I know. It\u0026#8217s been ages since I\u0026#8217ve gotten any abuse from Scottish nationalists.                 Even longer since I dished it out. It’s been nice not waking up and immediately plunging into a state of panic if I have more than 20 notifications on Twitter.            But I was given a brief reminder of what some of my comrades continue to face last week, when former Commonspace trailblazer-turned-Sunday Herald news editor Angela Haggerty made the mistake of tweeting a New York Times profile in which I was, for the first time in my nearly 20 years in music, described as a “British” rapper.            The second I saw it, I immediately retweeted it, adding “I’ve never been called a ‘British’ rapper before”. Because it’s been so long since I’ve been in a scrape with anyone of an ultra-Scottish nationalist persuasion, I thought nothing of it. Then followed the inevitable misinterpretation that my tweet, about being referred to as “British”, was also attributing that reference to Haggerty – as opposed to the automatically generated New York Times headline. Confirming, at least in the minds of a few Scottish nationalists, something they had long suspected: Angela Haggerty is, in fact, a mole, working for the British State. Comedy ensued.There are a few layers to this that I must carefully unpack. The first is the fact I am, at least in part, British. I have a British passport, a British provisional driving licence and am guaranteed security by a British military. I live in a city where many of my fellows regard themselves as British. The UK dash in my Scottishness is not something that either bothers me or that I would dispute. Nor is it something I feel a need to either revoke or performatively purge myself of. If England pillaged the world during the years of the British Empire, then Scotland was looking on, holding her jacket. As I snapped out of a nationalist dwam, mid-2014, in which we valiant Scots were a uniquely oppressed class of maverick renegades, incapable of racism, it struck me that we may have entered our historically fiendish union with England in 1707 because we were too pished to carve out an empire of our own. Rather than some caged lion, we were more like the Richard Hammond end of a poorly balanced Top Gear equation.READ MORE: Rap tutorials help troubled Scots school pupils turn the pageHaving spent the last few months travelling the UK, I’m positive there are no significant cultural differences to speak of between Scotland and most of England or Wales. My commitment to Scottish independence is based solely on gaining proximity to the decision-making processes that impact my community and family. London has proven time and time again that it’s incapable of taking incoming calls. Interestingly, this cultural lop-sidedness, where London is concerned, also finds expression in the arts and why suddenly being referred to as a “British” rapper was strange. Understanding why requires a brief history of Hip Hop culture itself.             Hip Hop culture originated in The Bronx, New York, in the early 1970s. Comprising four pillars of DJ, Breakdancing, Graffiti and Emceeing, it emerged out of African American poverty and political exclusion. DJs would connect two turntables and, using identical records, create drum loops from the funk and soul hits of the day. These records often had sections where the song would “break down” singing ceased, guitars pulled out and focus would turn to percussion and horns, usually for around eight bars.This section was referred to as the “break”. By spinning concurrent records backwards, consecutively, DJs created “beats” for break-dancers to perform or do battle. These beats soon became audio-canvases to which emcees would rhyme or face off in tense, often hilarious and exhilarating verbal jousts. Hip Hop, at its core, was – and remains – about community, artistic expression and creativity and, ultimately, violence reduction creating a space for anger, conflict and aggression to exist without spilling over into something more serious.READ MORE: Watch SNP MP perform Brexit rap in WestminsterAfter the release of Wild Style and later Beat Street – cult films documenting Hip Hop as it swept the States – it wasn’t long before Hip Hop arrived here electrifying kids in lower-class communities, who identified strongly with its irreverent aesthetics, all-inclusive participatory ethic and pulsating sociocultural resonance. By the mid-80s, there were hundreds of ‘breaking’ crews operating in Glasgow housing-schemes alone.            After a brief pioneering period, when regional UK acts were more closely aligned – in part because so many imitated the Americans and there was no money involved – the UK Hip Hop community largely shunned its Scottish iteration. Which is why “Scottish Hip Hop” – specifically rap – became a separate genre. Not because it wanted to annexe itself from the UK (the opposite in fact) but because it was widely rejected by it.The idea of people rapping in a Scottish dialect was more laughable the further south you went. The idea Scotland could “do” Hip Hop was preposterous, despite being home to some of the best Hip Hop artists the UK has ever produced.In the context of music, I regard myself as Scottish because I’ve been conditioned to. And not by nationalists either – many of whom, ironically, berate me for being a “rapper” – but by an all-encompassing London-centric culture that subsumes not only the Celtic nations, but also many English regions, from which countless stunning contributions to Hip Hop have emerged – consistently dismissed or ignored for over 20 years. Hip Hop is about representing not only yourself, but also your “hood”. Which is why so many regional artists retain impenetrable dialects and obscure slang, despite commercial and cultural pressure to conceal or renounce them. I’m a “Scottish” rapper, not because I want to deny Britishness, but because I live in Scotland and perform in a thick, Glaswegian accent. It would be unthinkable to suddenly rebrand, throwing the very community that gave me a voice under the bus, simply because I’m enjoying some mainstream recognition.I’m a British citizen, tax-payer and feel a strong sense of connection to British culture, but I’m Scottish – something British Hip Hop won’t let people like me forget. And, as well as my dual national identity, I also identify strongly with Hip Hop culture a young, global movement which has its own unique and ever-shifting norms and values. Central to which is the thorough, fearless authentic expression of where you come from. Being called “British” isn’t anything to make a song or dance about. I’m at ease with it and understand why international media would refer to an unknown like me as such. But, when it comes to Hip Hop, I’ve always been (and always will be) a “Scottish” rapper."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773335.1532459165!/image/image.jpg","title":"martyn mclaughlin podcasts are window into the weird and wonderful","story":"        The esoteric, niche world of podcasting has displaced live radio in my household, writes Martyn McLaughlin.                I have long considered myself an avid radio listener. It is a habit ingrained by weekend afternoons in my grandfather’s kitchen, where after a daunder back from the bookies, we would gather round the wireless and listen intently to proceedings from Ascot or Newmarket, where the rising pitch of the commentators vied for attention with the rush of hooves and the desperate, hopeful shouts of the crowd.            I should probably count myself lucky that I never developed an affinity for the gee-gees as a consequence, but I will always be grateful for that early introduction to a medium that felt more immediate than television ever could.            Growing up with one foot in the analogue age, I kept the flame burning, and with the advent of the internet and the proliferation of digital radio stations, my habit became hopelessly and permanently entrenched. I have lost count of sleepless hours given over to Ira Glass and John Hockenberry on National Public Radio’s Talk of the Nation, discussing obscure issues in a distant country in a way that felt relevant and intimate.Glass, of course, went on to create This American Life, a radio show which morphed into one of the world’s most popular podcasts. Even today, each episode is downloaded by around 2.5 million people. If that particular show’s success is well established, it would appear the popularity of its medium has yet to peak. The latest analysis by Rajar, the official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK, shows that as of this spring, some six million adults across Britain listened to at least one podcast a week.That number might appear relatively small – just 11 per cent of the population – but when you assess it the proper context, its scale – and growth – is really quite something. Only last year, the number stood at just 4.7 million, and the number of people now downloading podcasts now outstrips the reach of BBC Radio 5 Live. READ MORE: From football to knitting: the rise of the Scottish podcast            Such statistics have led to 2018 being hailed by the BBC as the year of the “podcast boom”. Such a bold prophecy may be intended as self-fulfilling, at least on the BBC’s part. In March, the corporation announced the appointment of its first-ever podcast commissioner, Jason Phipps, and it clearly believes it can build on the 240 million annual downloads of its programmes. It, along with other broadcasters and media companies, faces a stern challenge in attracting a younger demographic who do not consume their media via linear channels, and podcasting is one the most obvious areas to focus on. Recent research by Acast, one of the main competitors to iTunes as the world’s leading podcast platform, found that two thirds of listeners are aged between 16 and 34. What is more, nearly a fifth of them have only started listening in the past six months. The success of the BBC’s evolving podcasting operation alone will not solve that problem, but it is a start.            It is hard, however, to see the projected ‘boom’ coming to pass. Podcasting is hardly a new, emerging medium. In one form or another, it has been a staple of our media diet for well over a decade. iTunes first started collating a directory of podcasts as far back as 2005, when the term was named as the Merriam Webster dictionary’s word of the year. Within the space of 12 months, the comedian, Ricky Gervais, helped propel the medium into the public consciousness, with millions of users downloading his comedy shows.  For a good few years, the podcast charts were dominated by such high-profile figures looking to emulate Gervais’s success. And while the podcasting world is still inhabited by any number of celebrities, its greatest treasures are to be found elsewhere. READ MORE: Podcast tells gory tale of Scottish crime writer’s lifeIn the past few days, I have listened to a 50-minute documentary about the economics of US dentistry, an hour-long interview with Kenney Jones, the former drummer with the Small Faces, and a two hour-long show devoted entirely to the 1978 arcade game, Space Invaders.Slowly but surely, such esoteric listening choices have displaced live radio as my audio go-to. I subscribe to more than 70 different shows, and on an average week, I will listen to around 12 hours of programming. Over the past year, the lion’s share of this has consisted of podcasts which focus on US politics, such as FiveThirtyEight, Pod Save America, Trumpcast, Trump Inc, all of which provide incisive takes on the Trump administration.            But so too, my podcast diet is supplemented by an ever-widening spectrum of programmes that embrace niche subjects. On the one hand, it includes the likes of Trade Talks, a weekly insight into international trade deals, and The Tip Off, which interviews leading journalists about how they came across some of their biggest stories. On the other hand, it takes in Wrestle Me, where comedians Marc Haynes and Pete Donaldson revisit every WrestleMania event from 1985 onwards in chronological order, and Cult of Geshcast, in which two Glaswegian friends, Gavin Spence and Phillip Maddison, discuss various cults and sects through the ages. These are my niche interests, but whatever you are interested in, or even curious about, chances are there is a podcast out there for you. There might not be a boom in 2018, but with the bewildering choice of programmes out there, it’s hard to see how podcasts will fail to become an increasingly prominent part of our media landscape."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773542.1532513343!/image/image.jpg","title":"potential delay to new royal navy frigates branded utterly shocking","story":"        Five new Royal Navy frigates expected to begin operation in 2023 risk being delayed after the Ministry of Defence admitted it had received no viable bids to build them.

It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia.

avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and

obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH0607NCA.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

So too should the Irishlanguage, Gaelic culture and Irish identity.\nThe Good Friday Agreement was not about winners and losers.\nThe principles of mutual respect, parity of esteem and equality belong to allsides.\nThe politics of fear and division must be rejected.\nWe need a real and meaningful discussion about how we can share a vision forthe future and build towards reconciliation.\nA good start would be to start a genuine dialogue between Sinn Féin and OrangeOrder.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27418  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately. - Pat Sheehan\nA solidarity rally will be held in Belfast this evening following the attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey. \nThe rally will take place at the site of the former Andersonstown barracks and will be addressed by Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald. \nGerry Adams and Bobby Storey are also expected to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration. \nThe homes of both men were attacked in the early hours of Saturday morning when explosive devices were thrown. \nCCTV footage from the scene of the attack on Gerry Adams\u0027 home shows that a device was thrown from a passing car. \nAs well as to show solidarity with the two leading republicans and their families, this evening\u0027s rally has also been organised as a further show of solidarity with the people of Derry\u0027s Bogside following six nights of disturbances in the area last week. \nWest Belfast Sinn Féin MLA Pat Sheehan encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration in order to send a message to those behind the attacks. \n“The attacks involving explosive devices on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey were cowardly and reprehensible.\n“Those involved are opposed to the peace process and the process of change.\n“Sinn Féin will continue to represent this community and pursue our agenda for change, for peace and for a new agreed and united Ireland.\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately,\" he said. \nThe rally will be held tonight at 7pm. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27419  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nAttacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that. - Mary Lou McDonald\nThose responsible for the bomb attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey, and the recent disturbances in Derry, have no \"plan, strategy or vision for the future,\" Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has said. \nThe Sinn Féin leader made the remarks ahead of a rally in Belfast tonight to show solidarity with Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey whose homes were attacks with explosive devices at the weekend. \nSpeaking to the media in Belfast alongside Sinn Féin vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill and West Belfast MLA Pat Sheehan, the Sinn Féin president encouraged people to attend tonight\u0027s rally in Andersonstown. \nMary Lou McDonald said Sinn Féin would not be intimidated by such attacks and added that communities will not be bullied by those intent on causing violence and disruption. \n“There is no appetite, no excuse and no purpose behind the violence that occurred,\" she said. \n\"Attacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that,\" the Dublin Central TD added. \nThe Sinn Féin President said that those intent on violence have nothing to offer society. \n“Michelle and I were in Derry on Friday, we spoke to the people in the Bogside - they made it very clear how angry they are at a very small element that has brought hardship and trouble and panic in some cases to elderly residents and I know here in Belfast there is widespread anger.\n“There is zero tolerance for any element that would set out to cause harm or to cause disruption.\n“Those intent on this disruption have no political plan, have no political strategy, have no vision for the future.

music, performers and family entertainment to the heart of Ballymena\n  \nSummer Sounds at Broadway, an action-packed new programme of free outdoor entertainment featuring live music, performing arts and family fun, kicks off in Ballymena this Saturday (7 July).\n  \nThe exciting bill of activities will take place in the heart of Ballymena every weekend and is organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in conjunction with the Ballymena Business Improvement District.\n  \nSummer Sounds at Broadway’s inaugural performers will be hugely popular local bands Picture the Sound, and The Resolution, with stilt-walkers, jugglers and more on hand, from 11am.\n  \nMayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Lindsay Millar, said: “Summer Sounds at Broadway promises fantastic outdoor entertainment for all ages and will create a great atmosphere in the town centre every Saturday over the coming months.\n  \n“We want this brilliant new venue to be used by both budding and established artists from across Ballymena and further afield as a platform to showcase their talent.\n  \n“I’m delighted we have already secured local artists in Mid and East Antrim to perform at Broadway, where they can be enjoyed by locals and visitors to Northern Ireland’s number one shopping town.\n  \n“Our borough’s retailers are the very best around and you are guaranteed a very warm welcome and great service on any trip to Ballymena.\n  \n“Summer Sounds at Broadway will complement a town centre brimming with incredible independent retailers, high street giants and beautiful surroundings.”\n  \nThe structure’s recent completion marks the final stage of a multi-million pound investment in the town.\n  \nThe new venue, built by a Mid and East Antrim manufacturing firm, finally provides citizens with a fit-for-purpose community space in the centre of the town, with the series of free outdoor summer entertainment events aimed at rejuvenating the town centre and driving footfall.\n  \nIt provides the ideal space for a host of exciting events and performances aimed at showcasing up-and-coming talent from Mid and East Antrim and further afield, and promote the very best of culture and the arts in the Borough.\n  \nCreative groups and artists will be invited to book slots at Broadway.\n  \nThe name of the structure, Harmony Hub, was selected by Hollywood superstar Liam Neeson following a competition organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in partnership with schools throughout the area.\n  \nMr Neeson said: “We look forward to the future, welcome it, adapt and attract new business initiatives. This beautiful, yet simple structure symbolises all that and more. Many congratulations.”\n  \nMore details about the winning entry will be announced shortly.\n  \nThe Mayor added: “Our Council plays a key role in driving the economy of our Borough, as demonstrated by our commitment to, and delivery of, the public realm scheme.\n  \n“This investment is all about boosting economic growth, generating jobs and bringing more people to Mid and East Antrim.\n  \n“Our thanks to our local retailers and Ballymena residents for their patience throughout the regeneration work and we all look forward to what promises to be an exciting and successful future for the town.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs. John is a long established Councillor and his views have always been respected by the Party and its leadership.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

This was the first time in 32 years that the Twelfth celebrations were held in Donaghcloney.\n\nCarla Lockhart said: “We have once again been treated to a great cultural display on the Twelfth in Donaghcloney. I want to congratulate the officers of Lower Iveagh West Orange District and their organising committee, Donaghcloney Linen Greer Association. I know many hours of planning and preparation went into this event but to good avail. We had a real effort this year by the committee and residents of the village to ensure this was a week long festival and were treated to features for people of all ages with the Songs of Praise, A Drummers Tribute, a night of remembrance, the community fun night and then the Twelfth July celebrations. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“A great turnout of Orangemen and women, bandsmen, Lambeg drums and spectators with plenty of variety for children of all ages in the demonstration field. This is what our culture is all about. No one should be offended by it. I look forward to it returning again to Donaghcloney and I have no doubt that it will not be so long the next time.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"}]
