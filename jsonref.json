She is not thought to have married or had children.    It was only in 2011 that she re-emerged, when a German newspaper published an interview with her and sparking a flurry of interest in the last surviving members of the Nazi leadership\u0027s inner circle. In a documentary Pomsel talked about her three years working for the man responsible for spreading Hitler\u0027s poisonous ideology in newspapers and across the airwaves.She said: \u0027I wouldn\u0027t see myself as being guilty. Unless you end up blaming the entire German population for ultimately enabling that government to take control. That was all of us. Including me.\u0027 Pomsel described in the film how she was told to keep the Nazi top brass supplied with alcohol \u0027in order to retain the numbness\u0027 and stave off the reality of their imminent defeat by the hated Russians.                                                       In 2011, Brunhilde Pomsel broke a 66-year vow of silence about the Nazi regime when she gave an interview to popular German newspaper Bild. Her revelations about the Nazi power circle\u0027s last moments shocked the world.She revealed that even after a lifetime of service, Goebbels barely acknowledged her: \u0027You couldn\u0027t get close to him,\u0027 she said. \u0027He never once asked me a personal question. Right up until the end I don\u0027t think he knew my name\u0027.Pomsel spent the last 10 days of the Third Reich in the cellars of the propaganda ministry as Russian artillery and American bombers flattened her surroundings.She continued to pump out orders from Goebbels until the very last minute - when Goebbels shot his wife then himself.Immediately before the murder-suicide, Goebbels and his wife killed their six young children by breaking cyanide vials into their mouth.Aides were ordered to pour petrol on the corpses of the dead generals - but the remains were only partially burned, and later found by the Red Army.On May 1 1945, shortly after \u0027The Boss\u0027 - Hitler - committed suicide, the Russians came into the bunker and \u0027dragged\u0027 Pomsel out.

In 2007, Holy Cross selected a site for a new campus in Gentilly. Holy Cross remains the only all boys Catholic school in the Greater New Orleans area to offer a comprehensive pre-K through 12th grade education.\u0027The school has a long history dating back to the 1800s when it was originally an orphanage. In 1837, the Congregation of Holy Cross was founded.\u0027The Congregation took its name from a district in the city of LeMans, France – Saint Croix or Holy Cross. In 1849, the Archbishop of New Orleans invited five brothers of the Congregation of Holy Cross to New Orleans to assume responsibility for operating St. Mary\u0027s Orphanage. The city had been devastated by a series of epidemics: cholera, yellow fever, and malaria.\u0027In 1859, the congregation purchased Reynes Farm, a riverfront plantation. In 1879, as the need for the orphanage diminished, St. Isidore\u0027s College, a boarding and day school was opened. This became the original site on which Holy Cross School stood and it is here that Holy Cross\u0027 history officially began. The area has since become a Federal Historic District known as the \u0027Holy Cross District.\u0027\u0027The General Assembly of the state of Louisiana chartered the institution on June 20, 1890, empowering it to confer bachelor\u0027s and master\u0027s degrees. The original administration building was built for $15,000 in 1895. At the suggestion of the Archbishop, St. Isidore\u0027s College was renamed and solemnly dedicated as Holy Cross College.\u0027Two wings were added to the administration building in 1912 to accommodate the incoming students. Holy Cross operated a boarding program until 1972 that attracted as many as 150 student residents each year from across the South as well as from Central and South America.\u0027          The photographs were taken at Holy Cross School in New Orleans by an urban explorer Abandoned Southeast          Holy Cross was flooded by levee failures on the Industrial Canal due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005          A new campus was built in 2007 a new site in Gentilly and the old one damaged in Hurricane Katrina was left to rot          The red-brick exterior of the huge building hides the devastation inside after the storm hit the New Orleans region          Hurricane Katrina 80 per cent of the city buried under water and killed more than 1,500 people          130,000 people were displaced in the aftermath of the storm and buildings were left to rot          The school has a long history dating back to the 1800s when it was originally an orphanage          It was reopened as a boarding and day school as the need for the orphanage diminished          Abandoned Southeast says \u0027Holy Cross remains the only all boys Catholic school in the Greater New Orleans area to offer a comprehensive pre-K through 12th grade education\u0027Stunning aerial images of the road Jeremy Clarkson said was...A day they\u0027ll NEVER forget!

Yet despite their ripe old age, caravans are seeing something of a renaissance.‘Today’s caravans are a five-star experience,’ says holiday historian Andrew Jenkinson. ‘You can use them all the year round: modern tourers have full heating systems and double glazing. They are spacious, robust, ingeniously designed and incredibly comfortable. They have evolved.‘A few years ago, they tended to appeal mainly to older people who had fantastic memories of childhood holidays and had never lost the bug — or who wanted to rediscover it,’ says Andrew, author of caravan histories such as The CI Story. ‘But now lots of families are first-timers. Caravanning is enjoying a serious resurgence.’    Modern-day caravan: Yet despite their ripe old age, caravans are seeing something of a renaissance.

A British Airways Airbus A380 aircraft is pictured on the runway at London´s Heathrow Airport Emirates cut its order of A380s from 162 to 123 aircraft following a \u0027review of its operations, and in light of developments in aircraft and engine technologies\u0027.Meanwhile, the UAE carrier is buying more of the smaller A330-900 and A350-900 aircraft, purchasing 40 and 30 respectively.The Emirates order for the A330-900 and A350-900 is worth 21.4 billion US dollars (£16.6 billion).  Buzzing the pyramids, flying with the Red Arrows and the most glamorous cabins in the sky: The amazing story of the A380 told through incredible pictures By Jennifer Newton for MailOnlineThe A380 ushered in a new era of glamour at 38,000ft, with carriers using its cavernous interior to install suites, showers and bars.But now Airbus has sounded the death knell for this golden age of travel with the announcement, less than 12 years after its first commercial flight, that it will cease production of the superjumbo after 2021.Here we look back at the aircraft\u0027s remarkable history through fascinating pictures, from flying with the Red Arrows and buzzing the pyramids to peeks at the most luxurious cabins the aircraft offers.The early days of the A380          In 1994 Airbus announced it was to develop a very large double-decker airliner, called the A3XX, the previous name for the A380. Pictured is an early rendering by Airbus of the aircraft            Construction finally began in 2002. Pictured is a large section of fuselage being transported by road to the jetliner\u0027s final assembly plant in Toulouse, France          Parts for the A380 are produced across four European countries before being brought to Toulouse to be assembled. Pictured is a section of A380 being loaded on to a ship in Pauillac, France           A380 fuselage and wing sections are put on a freight ship ready to be shipped to Toulouse in October 2004           The wings for the A380 are made at a facility in Broughton, Flintshire, in Wales. Pictured is a wing travelling on a barge on the River Dee            A barge carries an A380 central fuselage down a river in the French city of Bordeaux in April 2004, during the development and construction of the first superjumbos            A fuselage section for the A380 is moved to the double-deck jetliner\u0027s final assembly facility in Toulouse in October 2004 It was more than 30 years ago in 1988 when the idea for a super-sized 500-seat airliner was first mooted at Airbus. The aim? To directly challenge Boeing\u0027s extremely popular 747.By June 1994, Airbus announced it was to develop a very, very large double-decker airliner, called the A3XX.And six years later the $8.8billion (£6.8billion) project to develop the plane, renamed the A380, began in earnest.After the design of the huge new aircraft was finalised, construction finally began in 2002.          A section of fuselage is unloaded off a ship in Paulliac. A380 parts arrive by ship in Paulliac in France before being loaded on to barges to take them through Bordeaux to a dock at Langon and then by oversize road convoy to the assembly plant          A section of the first A380 fuselage arrives at the final assembly plant in Toulouse in January 2005, just months before the A380\u0027s maiden flight           Inside the Toulouse Airbus plant in January 2005, showing the first three A380s side by side as they are constructed            One of the construction milestones came in January 2005, when the first A380 Rolls-Royce engine was assembled            The first A380 passenger airliner is moved between hangars at the Airbus factory in Toulouse          Team effort: The forward and centre fuselages are made in France, the horizontal tail plane made in Spain and the tails fins and rear fuselages built in Germany          Workers gather in front of the nose cone of an Airbus A380 at the opening ceremony for the new final-assembly plant at Airbus\u0027s Toulouse factory in 2004. At that time, Airbus expected to sell more than 1,000 A380s. Total orders in the end totalled just over 320 The parts for the plane were built across Europe. The wings were constructed in Wales, the forward and centre fuselages made in France, the horizontal tail plane made in Spain and the tails fins and rear fuselages built in Germany.They were then brought by sea, air and road, to the production plant in Toulouse to be assembled. Roads around the plant had to be widened in order for the huge new plane parts to be transported in.The maiden flightAirbus finally unveiled the first five test A380s in Toulouse in 2005 and the first maiden flight took place on April 27 of that year.The giant plane touched down to applause after a flight of just under four hours. Nearly 30,000 spectators watched the behemoth take off and land.          In April 2005 the first A380 was moved from the assembly plant across a busy road to Airbus\u0027s flight test centre at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport           The A380 touches down in Toulouse after its maiden flight on April 27, 2005. The giant plane landed to applause after a flight of just under four hours    The crew on the maiden flight took no chances - they donned parachutes and a handrail was installed inside the test plane leading from the cockpit to an escape door that could have been jettisoned had the pilots lost control. The plane was jointly captained by Claude Lelaie, Airbus\u0027 Senior Vice President Flight Division, and Chief Test Pilot and Vice President Jacques Rosay          Airbus staff and media gather around the A380 after its maiden flight. During the first flight it recorded measurements for 150,000 separate parameters and beamed real-time data back to computers on the ground           Once testing of the aircraft was complete, the A380 went on a world tour. It first came to Britain in 2006 when it appeared at the Farnborough Airshow and flew alongside the RAF\u0027s Red Arrows           In March 2007, the A380 touched down on US soil for the first time, during its world tour. It is pictured landing at New York\u0027s JFK Airport             After landing at JFK, the world\u0027s largest passenger plane was honoured by the New York Fire Department, which sprayed water over the aircraft           While travelling around the US on a world tour, the A380 also made a pit stop in Washington DC. The aircraft is pictured flying across Capitol Hill and the Washington Monument           The A380 flies past the high rise buildings of Hong Kong during its world tour in 2007     The first customer to have an A380 delivered for service was Singapore Airlines. Pictured is the carrier\u0027s first plane leaving the Airbus assembly plant. The first commercial flight was from Singapore to Sydney in October 2007          Singapore Airlines revolutionised air travel on its A380s by introducing first class suites. Sharmala Huey Yuen, a Singapore Airlines flight attendant, prepares the double bed in the luxury class suite in September 2009           The Singapore Airlines suites feature sliding doors and window blinds, an armchair hand-stitched by master Italian craftsmen, a standalone bed and a 23-inch wide LCD screen.

It now has over 100 A380s in its fleet, making it the biggest customer.Following Singapore\u0027s lead, it created lavish cabins, with first class ticket holders given showers and private suites.Australian flag-carrier Qantas was third to take delivery of the A380 while British Airways received its first A380 in 2013. No US carrier has ever ordered an A380.Problems ariseDespite being launched to much fanfare and receiving orders from 13 different airlines, the A380 has been beset with issues.In November 2010, Qantas Airways and Singapore Airlines temporarily suspended flights of the A380 after an engine failure forced an emergency landing in Singapore.          Emirates became the second airline to fly the aircraft. It now has over 100 A380s in its fleet, making it the biggest customer. Pictured is the first Emirates A380 after rolling off the production line in 2008            In November 2010, the Airbus A380 test aircraft flew a special flight over the Pyramids in Egypt following airport compatibility tests carried out at Cairo International Airport to confirm the airport was capable of handling A380 operations           British Airways received its first A380 in July 2013 and on its arrival at Heathrow, BA staff greeted it with Union flags. BA has 12 A380s in its fleet And by July, 2016 Airbus announced that it was cutting production of the A380 in half, going to just one jet a month by 2018.By 2018, Airbus said it would have no other choice but to halt the costly A380 programme if Dubai\u0027s Emirates airline, its biggest customer of the A380, did not place another order.Last year Emirates Airlines struck a $16 billion (£12.3 billion) deal to buy 36 A380s, but it is now switching some orders to the smaller A350.Analysts have pointed to customers demanding flights directly to their destination rather than following Airbus\u0027s model of taking a long haul journey from hub-to-hub followed by a short hop on a smaller plane.          The 100th A380 was bought by Malaysia Airlines and delivered in March 2013          A special celebration was held at the Airbus factory in November 2017 when the 100th A380 for Emirates was handed over       "},{"url":null,"title":"World Cup hero Gordon Banks missed knighthood officials lost nomination papers","story":"    Gordon Banks (pictured lifting the Jules Rimet in 1966) was considered for a knighthood but bungling officials lost his papers A friend of the late footballer told the Daily Mirror: \u0027The system may well have let Gordon down.\u0027It comes as Sir Philip Green keeps his title despite the fashion tycoon facing claims of racism and harassment.Prime Minister Theresa May has said \u0027steps should be taken\u0027 in Sir Philip\u0027s case as pressure builds for him to be stripped of his knighthood.\u0027I\u0027m glad he saved my header – it started a friendship I\u0027ll...Gordon Banks earned just £100-a-week, lost his eye in a car...Share this articleMr Banks lost his fight against cancer aged 81 this week and campaigners say that had the Government\u0027s Honours Committee not lost his papers, he wouldn\u0027t have missed out by dying before the upcoming Queen\u0027s birthday honours list.  Former Lord Mayor of Stoke Anthony Munday, 59, has been campaigning for the late Leicester star and said: \u0027It is frustrating and disappointing that the system may well have let Gordon down.\u0027          Gordon Banks (pictured) will never be knighted because the honour can\u0027t be given posthumouslyTerry Conroy, who used to play for Stoke, joined Munday to nominate Mr Banks for the honour three years ago.Mr Munday said that each year the honours came along and neither he nor Mr Conroy heard back.He claims that he then had political contacts investigate and was shocked when they reported forms had been \u0027mislaid\u0027.Mr Conroy, 72, said \u0027overtures\u0027 were made and he was told that the matter concerning his former teammate was being looked into. Caroline Tellwright, a Staffordshire farmer, also nominated the goalkeeper independent of the application submitted by Mr Conroy and Mr Munday.  She too was told that the 1966 squad legend was being considered again after both nominations were located.  On Saturday it was revealed that Mr Banks was in the running for a knighthood in June.Mr Conroy visited his old friend two weeks ago and said that he knew then his end was nearing and added there is \u0027no doubt\u0027 he should have been knighted. Ms Tellwright described the late goalkeeper as her \u0027hero\u0027 because of the charity work he carried out in his later years.  The Cabinet Office said it could not comment on the matter because \u0027the nomination process is confidential\u0027.Gordon Banks missed out on knighthood \u0027after Whitehall officials lost papers\u0027 - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Vegan activists perform rites ceremonies cattle abattoir","story":"    Vegan activists have begun performing \u0027last rites\u0027 ceremonies for incoming cows at an abattoir run by a major meat processing company.

The idea came to Hohler when he embarked on a tour of Britain’s public collections and realised quite how much there was to do on watercolour alone: Norwich Castle Museum held about 4,500 paintings by a single artist the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, meanwhile, had somewhere between 200,000-300,000 watercolours in its drawers. The value – and excitement – of the Watercolour World project, is that it views these historic paintings as documents, not aesthetic objects: visual records of the world at large, in colour, ning a full 150 years before photography took over as our primary documentary medium. Between the invention of the spool camera around 1900 (which instantly superseded the pocket watercolour box as documentary tool of choice) and the advent of mass commercial colour photography in the 1950s, we lost, in a sense, half a century of colour.The website, which has launched with about 80,000 works, focuses on pre-1900 documentary paintings: archival information gathering often duly kept in binders and boxes ever since. Some of the artists on the site were professional painters. Others were military draughtsmen, official expedition watercolourists, botanists, surveyors, as well as the untold numbers of amateurs – which Hohler suspects will turn out to have mostly been women, unpaid for their time and skill – who picked up a paintbrush to record the world around them.The website has started with already digitised pieces from public collections: the Rijksmuseum, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, the politan Museum of Art in New York, the Musée des Beaux-Arts d’Orléans, to name some. Hohler is most excited, though, about what’s hiding in private archives, if only because most owners don’t even realise what they’ve got. “They all say the same thing,” he says: “‘Oh, we don’t have much.’” But often they do – hidden away in an attic or empty trunks in the living room.This unintentional neglect is why many of the works are in sterling condition: light and handling threaten both pigment and paper forgetting about artworks doesn’t. While official draughtsmen used the best archival paper, amateurs worked on whatever they could find. Which lends an added incentive to the digitisation Hohler’s team is undertaking: many of these paintings have a shelf life, yet what they depict is potentially of vital importance.Hohler goes so far as to say that once the collection reaches the critical mass of 1m images, it will be an “absolutely indispensable tool to help us understand today”. From coastal erosion and ice-cap melt to loss of fauna and flora, not to mention direct human destruction (of Palmyra in Syria, say, by Islamic State, or the Seti tomb in Luxor, by tourists) these watercolours serve as an invaluable reference.Hohler cites the recently reported projected loss of a third of the Himalayan ice-fields. Most of the visual records we have of what those glaciers looked like 150 years ago is in watercolours. Among the images on the website is the first known, yet accidental, picture of Mount Everest, from the 1840s: it’s not even labelled Everest. A lot of the value in these images is similarly accidental. Often it’s the context – replete with treelines, snowlines or waterlines – the artist painted around, for example, the flower they’d set out to record.As Hohler puts it: “We have in this country all these images about, not this country, but the rest of the world – and they’re stuffed in drawers.” Beyond the UK, he has no idea quite how many images there are, worldwide, to be catalogued, but estimates it to be in the millions. The task is clearly not something his team will ever accomplish alone: the project is as much a call to arms as a public service. Anyone with a phone can send in a picture of a historical watercolour they might have lying about, to see if it’s worth cataloguing. And the more people do so, the more complete a picture of the bygone world this collection will provide.These watercolours, for the most part, even come with built-in metadata. The website retains the original caption information (even when it’s mistaken) as supplied by the collections the images come from. The team then tags them with appropriate search terms to help people find interesting stuff.And interesting stuff there is: from the French revolutionary knife grinder with his two canine assistants (search for “dogs”) to the students and their camel at a Marylebone boarding school (there are 366 images tagged with “camel” search instead for “boarding school”). Teachers will have a field day. And, Hohler’s team suspects, so will any punter as curious about their own neck of the woods as they are about far-flung lands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f298e160036dbfba3b6735a3bfcc9c39040164e/0_1019_3969_2381/master/3969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=692788aabc88cf68f36bd11ba3af7f7c","title":"gordon parks early work photography","story":"In the 1940s, Parks went from being a self-taught photographer to an in-demand figure in the industry, shooting for Ebony, Vogue, Fortune and Life.

Do we long to escape our children? To have sex with strangers at will? The Franco-Moroccan novelist Leïla Slimani’s Lullaby won the Prix Goncourt in 2016 and swiftly became a bestseller here last year. That tale of a murderous nanny, exposing the fetid emotional growths fouling the bourgeois home, was Slimani’s second novelistic investigation of forbidden desires. Now Adèle, the novel she wrote before that breakthrough success, has been translated into English by Sam Taylor.When we first meet Adèle, she’s leaving the house before her husband and son wake up, looking for sex on the way to work. “Adèle has been good,” the opening proclaims, but now “she wants to be devoured, sucked, swallowed whole.” For several years, she’s combined a sexless marriage to Richard with a closet life as a sex addict, seducing almost all the men she meets. The situation becomes unsustainable when her husband is injured in a road accident, depriving Adèle of freedom because she has to look after him.Slimani’s novels are hard to categorise. They combine the pace of the thriller with the flatness of tone that we might associate with Michel Houellebecq, or indeed with Camus and Robbe-Grillet. Like those writers, Slimani is drawn to revealing the hellishness of the ordinary and the ordinariness of hell. But this isn’t social satire or commentary. Class and race matter – in Lullaby the employer was of north African descent and the nanny white here Richard is upper class, Adèle working class – but these aren’t novels hustling for social change or even pushing us to be more honest about the falsity of bourgeois life. They are too story-driven for that. Adèle is rarely likable, but the narrative is on her side, breathless in its fears that sex won’t be available (“She hates the idea that her beauty will be wasted, that her good mood will be for nothing”) or that exposure will follow.In many ways, Adèle is a modern-day Madame Bovary, but the book itself has less in common with Flaubert than with the sensation novels that Emma Bovary reads addictively. Slimani is trying to shock, arouse and titillate us with extreme mental states. Addiction makes a good subject for her because Adèle’s desire to live a fantasised version of her own life seems to mirror Slimani’s desire to write sleek, fantastical prose, not quite committing to building a three-dimensional world. Like Flaubert, though, she empathises with her character, even at her silliest (Adèle falls asleep with her face in an ashtray), and occasionally we feel something like Flaubert’s interest in the nuances of Adèle’s mind. She likes to read Kundera, and there’s a quote from him in the epigraph: his definition of vertigo not as the fear of falling but as “the desire to fall … the intoxication of the weak”. Slimani seems interested in delineating this intoxication.In Lullaby, the question driving the book is not only whether the mother Myriam will find a way to survive bourgeois life without feeding off the weakness of another woman, but whether the nanny will give in to her own weakness, abdicating responsibility for keeping her charges alive. Here there’s the question of whether Adèle will allow her addiction to take over her life, destroying her love for her son. Both books are very good at showing that there can be a kind of gleeful pleasure in overcoming your fears by living them out, losing the things you are most desperate to hold on to. “Wanting to is the same as giving in,” Adèle thinks, “the dam has been breached. What good would it do to hold back now?” In both cases, the rapid descents feel just about credible enough to tell us something about the form of vertigo Kundera defined.Adèle was published in France in 2014 five years later, it appears in Britain in the midst of #MeToo. Some of what it says about sex and power may seem more outdated and therefore taboo-laden now than it did then. Slimani began writing the novel when the Dominique Strauss-Kahn trial was in the news, and there’s some attempt to reverse the usual power structures by making the sex addict a woman. But though Adèle seeks power through sex, she’s attracted to powerful men and she relies on them to overpower her. If Adèle were asked about #MeToo, she would throw back her head with her usual loud laugh and say that the men are only acting as the women want them to. Her constant fantasy is of “the real men, the good ones, somewhere else, the ones who would finally know how to control her body”, and she does not have the intellectual curiosity or the emotional courage to seek new structures for desire. I found myself wondering what kind of novel it could be if her husband were better in bed, or if Adèle were less submissive and had moved further beyond Emma Bovary in her desires. What if it was reasonable rather than self-destructive or self-pitying for a woman to feel constricted by family life and ask for more?• Lara Feigel is the author of Free Woman: Life, Liberation and Doris Lessing (Bloomsbury).

On this week’s books podcast, the ’s resident thriller fan Alison Flood struggled to finish The Flower Girls, a new thriller by Alice Clark-Platts, the plot of which contains similarities to the James Bulger murder case. This sparked a discussion on the books desk about the books that have most disturbed us: commissioning editor Richard Lea had nightmares after reading Colson Whitehead’s zombie novel Zone One I once had someone hide my copy of American Psycho so I’d stop dwelling on it and associate culture editor Claire Armitstead once destroyed a copy of Naked Lunch by William Burroughs, because she was so disturbed by a particular scene: “I put it in the fire!

However, Airbus said a “significant number” of staff will move to production of other, more popular models and major job losses in the UK are not expected as a result of the announcement.Rhys McCarthy, the national officer for aerospace at Unite, said the union is seeking assurances from Airbus that there will be no job losses. He added that companies in the A380 supply chain, including Redditch-based GKN, are a “key concern”.Tom Enders, Airbus’s outgoing chief executive, said the cancellation was “painful for us”. He said: “We have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years.”Speaking at Airbus’s headquarters in Toulouse, France, Enders said the effect on jobs in the UK “needs to be evaluated”. He said: “Hopefully we can reuse and redeploy a significant number of employees there.“What we’re seeing here is the end of the large, four-engine aircraft,” said Enders, who admitted that the company was a decade late in developing the superjumbo. Boeing, Airbus’s American arch-rival, this month celebrated 50 years of production of its 747.Engines for the A380 are produced in Derby by Rolls-Royce, another major British aerospace employer, although it is thought that the effect on UK jobs numbers will be small.In a statement, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce’s civil aerospace president, said: “The A380 is a world-class feat of engineering, much loved by passengers, and we are obviously saddened that deliveries will come to an end.”Airbus said that more than 190 million passengers have flown in the A380 since the first plane rolled off the assembly line in Toulouse, France, in 2007. However, the plane, which can theoretically carry as many as 800 passengers, has struggled for profitability as demand for mid-sized jets boomed.However, the A380 cancellation will add another element of uncertainty for the future of UK operations already threatened by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Enders last month decried “Brexiteers’ madness”, saying that future investment decisions would be influenced if Brexit led to significant trade frictions.Enders on Thursday said he believed the “voices of reason” would prevail, avoiding a no-deal Brexit. In June last year Airbus said there would be a cost of €1bn (about £880m) for every week of delay in production. The company and its suppliers have built up buffer stocks of about €1bn, in line with estimates made in June.Enders said: “Looking at the situation as it is I’m still optimistic that a solution can be found that avoids a fall from a cliff.”The end of the A380 may free up space at Airbus’s Toulouse and Hamburg facilities, where final assembly is currently carried out, giving them a boost in the competition for business with the UK. However, Enders denied reports that Spain had made a formal offer to take wing production from the UK after Brexit.The end of the A380 comes at a crucial time for Airbus as it takes on a new leadership team after losing out to Boeing in the aircraft deliveries race in 2018. Guillaume Faury, a former helicopter engineer who became the president of Airbus’s commercial aircraft business in February 2018, will take over from Enders as chief executive in April.Faury said the risks from Brexit were “enormous” in both the short and long term, with the principal risk to Airbus coming in delays at the UK’s border with the rest of the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ef9a4733a1111bad0bdbacb1573a071730445f/20_50_4157_2494/master/4157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbb92d1f15f44fc73682642cc7ed89ed","title":"brexit has cost uk economy at least 80bn since vote bank of england rate setter","story":"Gertjan Vlieghe’s estimate of weekly bill, £800m, is more than double battlebus ‘bonus’ Brexit has already cost the UK economy at least £80bn since the EU referendum, and a damaging no-deal scenario could force an emergency cut in interest rates, according to a Bank of England rate-setter.Britain had lost about £40bn a year, or about £800m a week of lost income, he said, in the period since the referendum as its economy stalled while the rest of the world recorded one of its strongest expansions of the past decade.Vlieghe’s estimate for the weekly cost of Brexit so far is more than double the £350m the Leave campaign claimed could be saved on EU membership fees and instead spent on the NHS. The claim, emblazoned on the side of the campaign’s battlebus, became a key focus for debate in the run-up to the vote. “It is very unusual for investment to shrink that much when the rest of the world is doing pretty much just fine, until at least recently.“UK growth in the past two years has been weaker than we would have expected based on the performance of the global economy alone,” he said. “Based on what happened in the rest of the world we would have expected UK growth to accelerate but actually it slowed.” Several estimates have been made before to quantify the cost of the Brexit vote. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, has previously said the vote cost households about £900 each in lost income. There are also various estimates for the potential hit from Britain crashing out without a deal on 29 March.Threadneedle Street estimates the worst-case disruptive scenario could spark a slump into a recession with worse consequences for Britain than the 2008 financial crisis, while the Treasury estimates that all Brexit options are worse for the economy than remaining in the EU.Vlieghe, an independent economist on the Bank’s nine-member MPC, said the magnitude of the potential negative hit to the economy was uncertain, particularly over the long term.While he said there was an important democratic debate on the possible trade-offs between the political and economic consequences of Brexit, he added that leaving the EU without a deal could warrant an emergency cut in interest rates.“In the case of a no-deal scenario I judge that an easing or an extended pause in monetary policy is more likely to be the appropriate policy than a tightening,” he said.However, should Britain secure a smooth Brexit deal, the world economy manage to avert a further slowdown and inflationary pressure in Britain rise, he said it would be appropriate for the Bank to raise rates around once per year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff4fd2863c5aaaae33ab59ffd5556de7cecb7d38/0_130_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=533e6e7dbb507f5b68bf3eaad9bccb83","title":"just one in 10 back quick sale of government stake in rbs royal bank of scotland","story":"Shares in bank are worth less than half what was paid at time of £45bn bailout in 2008Fewer than one in 10 people support a quick sale of the government’s majority stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, while two-thirds worry the bank will fail to serve the public interest once in private hands, a poll shows.The Treasury plans to sell the entire public stake by 2023-2024, but is projected to lose about £28.5bn in the process, according to the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility. That loss is the result of a drop in the share price, with the Treasury having paid 502p per share in 2008. RBS shares were trading at 243p on Thursday morning.Positive Money has launched a public petition urging the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to cancel any further sale of RBS shares and keep the bank under public ownership with a “mission to serve the public interest”.The campaign group’s executive director, Fran Boait, said: “The government has an opportunity to ensure that in the future, RBS works in the public interest. A huge number of improvements are possible, from shifting its lending towards SMEs to expanding access to banking services in communities which are currently under served.”Labour has previously signalled plans to make it mandatory for RBS to lend to small businesses using government funds. The shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, Jonathan Reynolds, recently said a Labour government would halt further stake sales but would not be involved in the day-to-day running of RBS.A Treasury spokesperson said: “The government intervened in RBS to protect people’s savings and businesses. But private investors, not taxpayers, should bear the risk of companies such as RBS, and that’s why we’ve committed to returning the bank to private ownership. But we will only sell RBS shares when it represents value for money for the taxpayer.”An RBS spokesperson said: “The timing and price of any government share sale is a matter for the Treasury.

And not only fly but soar so quietly, especially compared with the Boeing 747 it was designed to supersede and outclass. Passengers love it. But among the airline buyers, the A380 never completely took off.The announcement from Airbus that the final curtain will come down on the A380’s pan-European production line comes after years of speculation that the superjumbo was doomed. Orders had dried up in a risk-averse airline industry, whose economics and route networks were altered just at the wrong moment for the A380.Airbus had nosed ahead of the pack in producing a plane built with lighter materials, much more fuel-efficient, and potentially offering big savings and profits on routes where airlines could guarantee to load hundreds of passengers on every flight.However, even as the first A380 entered service in 2007, the orders were piling up for a different plane still in the pipeline from rival Boeing: the 787 Dreamliner, which could fly a similar range on only two engines, carrying a more viable number of passengers, making more routes possible.The hub and spokes model of aviation – where airlines competed for space at crowded intercontinental airports with connecting passengers, and the bigger the long-haul plane the better – was evolving. The need for Airbus’s expensive double-decker – wings so wide that airport stands and equipment had to be remodelled to accommodate it – was fading.The doubts escalated into a downward spiral when few customers were willing to take a punt on planning for a plane whose future was in question. Only one airline, Emirates, appeared fully behind it, placing giant orders that were single-handedly sustaining the programme. British Airways talked up the plane’s virtues but talked down the price. Qantas, stung by teething problems as an early adopter, stalled on an order made in 2006 and finally axed it only last week. Even Air France cut back on the plane assembled in Toulouse.The most haunting sign was news that two of the first A380s, still in their infancy in aircraft years, were parked in the Pyrenees and being stripped for parts. The aircraft were being reduced from great birds of the sky to mere organ donors in a decade – but it was a more economical solution for their owner than trying to lease them to unwilling airlines.When Emirates finally decided enough was enough, seeking to convert its order to newer, smaller models, it was game over. Few can blame Airbus for wanting to cling on and push this incredible plane, whose virtues are unquestioned. But the world it was built for has not panned out as Airbus hoped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cab3748762df44eabce7635c79b83215b7dc22c/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b9dd2c810a93e7c80be6b5399810c9b","title":"uk estate agents house prices are at their gloomiest for 10 years says rics","story":"Expectations, demand and sales expectations all down in latest market snapshotBrexit uncertainty and a lack of affordability in some areas continue to stifle the UK housing market, leaving Britain’s estate agentswith their gloomiest view of property values in 10 years.The latest monthly snapshot from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) shows a further weakening of the market, with demand, prices and sales expectations all down.The most downbeat responses to the survey continued to come from London and the south-east, followed by East Anglia and the south-west. These regions have experienced strong price growth over the past six years, which has stretched affordability, and the high prices are a key factor putting off would-be buyers, Rics said. The Rics prices balance has been negative or flat since July 2017, while sales expectations have been in negative territory since August 2018.Surveyors and estate agents have, however, become more optimistic since December about prices and sales over the next 12 months. Northern Ireland and Scotland, property values continue to rise, have the strongest price expectations for the coming year, followed by the north-west and Wales. In London, however, they expect prices to fall.Simon Bainbridge at Savills in Darlington said there had been plenty of positive activity despite Brexit uncertainty, although “there are prospective buyers openly admitting they await the Brexit outcome”.The average time it takes to sell a property, from listing to completion, has reached 19.4 weeks, the longest since this data series was introduced in 2017.David Knights of David Brown \u0026amp Co in Ipswich said: “There was the normal ‘bounce’ in the market expected in January with a good number of viewings and offers, but this did not last and coinciding with the reopening of the Brexit negotiations, we witnessed a slowing down in the last 10 days of the month.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af4cc84ca81e178320b1363aef9b7a527e3002f/0_0_4155_2493/master/4155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b674b79cbdb25a0a0a16b4d89c3dd742","title":"cat ladders a creative solution for felines in flats in pictures","story":"Strategically placed ramps and ladders for urban cats are all the rage in Bern.

As the chimpanzees arrange their branches into a makeshift ladder and one of them makes its daring escape from its Belfast zoo enclosure, some words ring out loud and clear: “Don’t escape, you bad little gorilla!” a child onlooker shouts from the crowd. And … POP … with that a tiny explosion goes off inside my head. Something knocks me back about this sentence. It’s a “kids-say-the-funniest things” kind of sentence, and in any other situation I’d offer a warm smile and a chuckle of approval. But not this time. This statement has brought out the pedant in me.At this point, you may wonder if I’m capable of fleshing out a 700-word article chastising a toddler for mistakenly referring to a chimpanzee as a gorilla. The good news is that, though I am more than capable of such a callous feat, I don’t intend to write about this child’s naive zoological error. In fact, this piece isn’t really about the (gorgeous, I’m sure) child. It’s about us. You and me, and the words we use.So let’s repeat it. That sentence, I mean. “Don’t escape, you bad little gorilla!” the child shouted. The words I’d like to focus on in this sentence are the words “you” and “bad”. The words “you” and “bad” are nice examples of a simple law of nearly all human languages. They are examples of Zipf’s law of abbreviation, where more commonly used words in a language tend to be shorter. It’s thought that this form of information-shortening allows the transmission of more complex information in a shorter amount of time, and it’s why one in four words you and I write or say is likely to be something of the “you, me, us, the, to” variety.Language. Information. Communications efficiency. So far, so very human, you might argue. But wait. Because you’d be wrong. Because, of course, we humans aren’t the only ones to communicate using such laws of communication. This week, scientists at the University of Roehampton described their analyses of 58 different types of “let’s play” gestures that chimpanzees give to one another in the wild – and these gestures also displayed Zipf’s law of abbreviation. The frequently used play gestures were shorter in length than less frequently used gestures. In other words, it turns out that our language law is also their law, to a degree. It’s a shared communications law. Even more wonderful than this, however, is that their play gestures also tick off another human communications law, Menzerath’s law, which predicts that larger linguistic structures are made up of shorter parts. Chimpanzees manage this, too.For a topical example of a human word that obeys Menzerath’s law, take “Brexit” – a shortening that has freed up time to get our leave-the-EU negotiations done at top speed. In summary, this week’s scientific discovery means that if chimpanzees had a play-gesture for “British exit from the EU”, they would probably stumble across the same time-saving shortening as us. (Whether they would be able to do a better job of negotiating Brexit is, as yet, unknowable, but far from unimaginable.)And so, back to our escaping chimp and the words of that excited toddler watching from the sidelines. As far as one-liners go, I’m happy to admit to you that “you bad little gorilla!” isn’t quite up there with Charlton Heston screaming, “You damn dirty apes!” at a crowd of latex-laden Hollywood extras, but I find that there is a certain delicious irony in its being blurted out by a child, itself learning unconsciously the rules of grammar and word-use that apply to all humans.Deep down, we’re all toddlers, mastering the language bestowed on us by our ancestors. Deep down, we’re all using grammatical rules and communication laws without a moment’s consideration. And, spectacular as it seems, it turns out we’re not the only ones because the chimps are at it, too.And so it seems opportune to finish with four of our simplest human words. They are little words and so, according to Zipf’s law, they are words that really matter. And they now apply to other species as much as to ours: me, you, them, us.• Jules Howard is a zoologist and the author of Sex on Earth and Death on Earth"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcb8a4bfed86ac44788b76ead3591ae5e2288e0b/0_81_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74c8203a415909e823cd24d2cbdd6baf","title":"remain theresa may brexit deal article 50","story":"Although some plans are being talked up and others talked down, Theresa May knows everything is still to play forEven at the best of times, politics can be a place of deception and a hall of mirrors. High politics and low calculation are inseparable in the way MPs cast their votes. For some of us, that’s part of what makes politics so fascinating. But, over Brexit, the mirrors glint and deceive more than ever.As the Commons prepares for yet another day’s voting on Brexit today, with more votes to come later this month and in March, this always needs remembering. Today’s votes are skirmishes in a campaign of positioning, not the full battle. Thus far, none of the big Commons votes have meant precisely what they may appear to mean.The most prominent example illustrates this. Theresa May’s deal with the EU was massively trashed in the Commons on 15 January by 230 votes. Yet many Conservative MPs voted against it in the full knowledge that it was not the final word on the subject. Two weeks later, most of them lined up behind the so-called Brady amendment, which gives the bulk of May’s original deal a second chance.Amid the fog of the conflict, it can be tempting to assume that more has been settled in the politics of Brexit than is the case. The reality is that most of the big options, and some small ones, are still in play. Just as May’s deal may yet survive largely intact, complete with a version of the Northern Ireland backstop, so other options that stretch from a Norway-style soft Brexit to an exit without a deal – all of which have their supporters at Westminster – cannot be ruled out.The underlying reasons for this uncertainty are unchanged too. The European issue is huge, complex and isive. Parliament and government are still struggling to adjust to a referendum vote they mostly do not support and which is not easy to implement. And we have a hung parliament. The combination is a recipe for instability and uncertainty. Ever since the vote for the Brady amendment on 29 January, May has claimed that she has a “substantial and sustainable” majority for her attempt to fettle the backstop and get the deal through the Commons. Well, of course she says that. It’s in her interest. She wants to weaken the will of her rebels.But that does not make it true. The majority for Brady was a single frame from a moving film. The movie has already moved on. May’s motion for today’s debate got into trouble with the Tory rebels yesterday precisely because it acknowledges another truth – that there is also a Westminster majority against no deal – that the rebels will not accept. Substantial majority? Pull the other one.That is the same reason why reports of the death of the Cooper-Boles amendment have also been premature and exaggerated. That amendment, which proposed an extension to the article 50 process to prevent a no-deal Brexit, went down by 23 votes two weeks ago. One of the reasons it fell, however, is that 24 Labour MPs voted against it or abstained. Some of them did so, in part, because they didn’t want to be tarred with voting to prolong Brexit when, in fact, it may be prolonged anyway – exactly as the UK’s chief negotiator Olly Robbins was overheard predicting this week.Whatever happens in the Commons tonight, these alternatives not only live to fight another day but may also win in the end. This week, May called on Tory MPs to hold their nerve while she continues her quest for a saleable version of the backstop. But the same advice applies with equal force to the moderates across the Commons who want to emerge with a softer Brexit deal than May has proposed. Their moment could yet come.To say this is not to be in denial. On the contrary, it is to recognise the facts. Looking through the history of Brexit since July 2016 when she became prime minister, three truths can be discerned about May’s approach. The first is that she needs to deliver the least-worst Brexit deal for the country. The second is that she is determined to avoid no-deal. The third is that she wants Brexit to be delivered by the Conservative party and its parliamentary allies.Her problem, all along, is that these three ducks won’t line up. That is extremely unlikely to change. The real problem is that third duck. May remains absolutely Tory-focused on Brexit. But there are not enough Tory and DUP MPs who will vote for the kind of deal she craves. The 15 January rejection, in which 118 Tory MPs voted against her deal, undoubtedly exaggerated the internal opposition. But those 118 will not all come back into line at the end of the month, or in March. Some of them will. Some of them won’t – perhaps including the DUP.In other words, a Brexit deal will only happen with some opposition support. But how much will May need? Not even the chief whip knows. Jeremy Corbyn, who supports Brexit but who wants the Tories to own it, blurs many calculations. Yet not all of the Labour MPs who failed to support Cooper-Boles are supporters of May’s deal. Some them just don’t want to be responsible for an article 50 extension. What is more, they may get their wish, if what Robbins was overheard saying in that Brussels hotel bar on Tuesday night by ITV News’s Angus Walker were to happen.Ever since 29 January, when the Brady amendment was carried and the Cooper-Boles amendment was lost, many have assumed that the die was cast. There is a mood of fatalism in remainer Britain that, after those votes, May is finally going to deliver a Tory-facing Brexit. Yes, that could happen. But the facts and the numbers don’t yet support that view. Facts and numbers still count for a lot, even in a hall of mirrors. But leadership counts for even more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa51401ba97e6e1111d3adc5150c8defe232dc28/0_131_4850_2910/master/4850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee31d35ad7476de8a19371e1a0b093a0","title":"shamima begum grooming islamic state pregnant uk","story":"It’s impossible not to feel a jolt of shock when confronted with the photo of Shamima Begum on the front page of this morning’s Times. Four years ago – when we last saw her – it was accepted that Begum had been brainwashed. There was consensus that she was an innocent child who’d been groomed online. Begum was allowed to be the victim in the nation’s narrative – one that over decades had grasped the power and dangers of grooming – because that demanded nothing from us. She was the little girl who’d been caught up in a dangerous death cult the pixelated image of a kid caught on CCTV about to fly, and that was sad.It was also made easier by her absence. We only needed to empathise with Begum’s situation in the abstract. Of course, we wanted her to be rescued and returned to Britain immediately. But that was just a fantasy. I can’t have been alone in assuming these girls would simply meet a horrible fate in the fighting abroad. Having been found alive and nine months pregnant in a Syrian refugee camp, Begum is no longer an abstract concept. Instinctively it feels a little harder to say we should bring her back to her home in the United Kingdom – especially given her apparent lack of remorse. And yet is she not still a victim of grooming? Still a British citizen we should be looking to help? There are already those arguing that since Begum left the UK to join Islamic State four years ago her situation has changed entirely. Ex counter-terrorism chief Mark Rowley told the Today programme on Radio 4 this morning that when Begum was 15 he considered her a victim. Now she is an adult what happens next, he argued, should be determined by clinical risk assessment and the consideration of cold, hard facts. He wants us to separate those grainy images of a young girl from the crisp picture of the woman she is today.But to see Begum in isolation to past events serves no purpose. The brainwashed child she was has everything to do with the brainwashed young woman she has become. That’s not to justify what she has done, but to see the series of events that have unfolded in her life as being traceable directly back to her grooming and subsequent radicalisation. Children are influenced by those around them, a product of their environment. We only develop and learn to be better when another influence takes a bad one’s place. Since the age of 15 Begum has not been afforded that opportunity in the caliphate it is unsurprising her views continue to be as dangerous as when she left – they’ve become her norm.If she seems untroubled by the violence she has witnessed, that’s no more a sign of a callous and wicked villain than a vulnerable young woman who is profoundly scarred. We know that trauma in childhood impacts your experiences as you grow older. I can’t begin to imagine what she has seen in her life, what it’s like to have had two children die. What we told ourselves about that 15-year-old girl remains true to this day, except now helping this young woman requires more than just easy words.That’s not to say Begum is to receive a hero’s welcome back at Gatwick airport. To rehabilitate and reintegrate her back into society will take much work by dedicated professionals, be in no doubt. But to try to help her must be better than leaving this teenager to languish in a camp, to quite possibly witness her third child die. If rehabilitation proves impossible, at least back in Britain she can live under supervision and be kept from doing further harm – to herself or to others. And should, one day soon, Begum be in a position to rejoin British society proper, who could be better placed to warn other vulnerable children of the dangerous reality of online grooming, of radicalisation by extremists and the acts that led her to commit? Our justice system is based on the possibility of rehabilitation. It would be wrong to write off the prospect of anyone changing, let alone a vulnerable 19-year-old girl and her unborn child.• Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at Huck magazine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/296d6afc45a558c71500ef2d74e3a7e6cb5b3f11/0_274_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a24ce53b114150c23e134a2e69297ba","title":"the best valentine gift not having to buy one at all","story":"Whatever you buy will be loaded with misunderstanding. Better to arrive at a point where you no longer need to buy anything at allValentine’s Day is an exciting time of the year, when marketing departments across the land scramble to take an entirely loveless product and give it a romantic spin. Suggestions this year include gifting your loved one an entry in a Tough Mudder race – for real, you give himher a token to scramble over a set of obstacles, because nothing says “I care” like “I’m worried about your fitness levels”. Elsewhere, there is a discount on waxing services, the circuitous generosity logic being that you will be able to give the gift of your own hairlessness.They assail you like this because they know you are desperate. The ideal Valentine’s gift is extremely cheap, since money besmirches emotion, and also, if you outrank in value whatever you have been bought yourself, you instigate a future Valentine’s arms race.Expense depersonalises: think a wallet, roses, perfume or a pen. All regular fallback options – meat, booze, cheese, socks – carry the taint of evanescence: “Dear loved one, hopefully we will last longer than this gift.” Cheap things, however, must be planned or they look incredibly random, like the ice bucket in the shape of a pineapple that someone bought me once, and I still haven’t stopped going on about, seven relationships and 20 years later. A shell, a postcard, an out-of-print book – you would have to plan for a year to make these look like legitimate love tokens rather than something you found down the back of a sofa.Then, miraculously, five years into any relationship, there is a Valentine’s amnesty, and you no longer have to do anything but make an affectionate remark and fry an egg in the shape of a heart."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22bdee6ec394c2c02884bbeea3005d71368ead20/632_204_1835_1101/master/1835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ce9626b46c6599d18a26383fad28533","title":"valentines day metoo era","story":"Back in the 90s, I didn’t realise my unrequited advances might be ‘scary’. Times have changed – for the betterI’ve always liked Valentine’s Day, and believe men who dismiss it as commercialised nonsense are joyless tightwads. My enthusiasm dates back to primary school. My teacher made us cut scraps of shiny red paper into heart shapes, glue them to flimsy cards, and write messages inside to our mums – although I remember wanting to give my card to a girl named Demelza.Ernest Hemingway said he had to be in love to be able to write. When I was a teenager in the 1990s, I had to be in love to go to school. My love was usually unrequited, so Valentine’s Day offered an annual shot at redemption. In year 9, I loved Tammy, so I wrote a haiku inside a Valentine’s card and placed it on her desk, along with a Terry’s Chocolate Orange. “Thanks,” said Tammy. I said I loved her. “You don’t know what love is,” she said, and went to maths.I sent more Valentine’s over the years and felt sorry for myself when they got me nowhere. “Why won’t she like me?” I wailed, alone in my room, Radiohead’s Pablo Honey playing on repeat. At university, after reading Chaucer’s The Knight’s Tale, in which two men compete to decide who will marry a princess without ever really consulting her, I posted a Valentine’s card to Becky, with whom I’d been besotted in sixth form. This was Chaucerian courtly love, I told myself, but Becky disagreed and said getting my card out of the blue was scary. I’d never considered that it might be unpleasant to receive my unwanted attention.I take responsibility for my mistakes but I also wonder, in retrospect, if there was something in the cultural water of the 90s which encouraged boys such as me to think girls should like us. Last year, in an article for the New Yorker, the actor Molly Ringwald discussed the 1985 film The Breakfast Club, in which she plays Claire, who is sexually harassed – at the same time as being called shallow and pathetic – by the film’s slacker anti-hero, Bender. “It’s rejection that inspires his vitriol,” Ringwald wrote. “He never apologises for any of it, but nevertheless he gets the girl in the end.”By the 90s, young men like Bender were everywhere, as the popularity of Nirvana brought outsider schtick to the masses. Nirvana were progressive in important ways, speaking out against homophobia and sexism and critiquing masculinity in songs like Been a Son. But there was also a sense of grievance about Kurt Cobain that encouraged a form of male entitlement that was subtler, but arguably no less toxic, than the machismo he rejected. Today it seems ridiculous to think that long after he had been hailed as the voice of his generation, Cobain was harbouring grudges against the popular crowd at his high school.Nirvana’s music remains influential, as does the quintessential 90s sitcom Friends, even though the problematic behaviour of Ross Geller has been enumerated. Ross is obsessed with Rachel, his younger sister’s friend, jealous of her male colleagues, and feels threatened when she’s successful. But Ross is an educated, sensitive guy, so Rachel should like him, surely?Perhaps the writer David Foster Wallace, a 90s figure in outlook and image, thought like this. You’d never guess from the stories in Brief Interviews with Hideous Men (1999), which examine male attitudes to women. Recently, though, the author Mary Karr described how Wallace terrorised her after they stopped dating. Did being able to write thoughtfully about misogyny mean Wallace assumed there was no need to check his own behaviour?In 2018, some male commentators claimed #MeToo was taking the fun out of Valentine’s Day – this is nonsense. As the writer Jaclyn Friedman said in reply: “The only people for whom #MeToo is making the world less sexy are abusive men and their enablers.”If you are sending a Valentine’s card, just make it clear it’s from you, as anonymity is too steeped in the idea of romance as pursuit to be appropriate now. Think carefully before sending one to a colleague many of us meet our partner at work, but if you get this wrong it’s a recipe for awkwardness. Do not send a Valentine’s to somebody who you ultimately know is not into you (in my heart of hearts, I knew mine were unwelcome). Finally, come up with a better gift than a chocolate orange. And, if it still doesn’t work out, move on without feeling sorry for yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9c54ae5dab8417651c3c371ff37fb4e9938eb6f/0_0_941_568/master/941.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d10deee1fe537ac5308ee0a96b42211 465w","title":"universities stamp out creativity are graduates ready for work","story":"Universities are changing the way they teach to prepare students for a future in which lots of jobs will be automatedA few numbers are enough to sum up how far the world of work is changing. More than six million workers fear their jobs could be replaced by machines in the next 10 years. Around 1.1 million people now work in the gig economy, using online platforms to find small, often on-demand, jobs. And a third of graduates find themselves mismatched to the jobs they secure on graduation.What universities can do to prepare their graduates for an unknown future was the subject of a roundtable, sponsored by HSBC, held in Birmingham last week and attended by senior academic leaders, employers and policy-makers.It emerged that the numbers did not paint the full picture. Take automation: Scott Corfe, chief economist at the Social Market Foundation, pointed out that automation did not necessarily mean fewer jobs – just different ones. And politicians were wrong to assume that these would largely be in programming in fact, programming was likely to be automated in future, while more creative skills would still be in demand. “The key thing is to enable people to reskill and move around the job market in a more nimble way than they currently can do,” he said.Paul Faulkner, chief executive of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, questioned the idea that an ever-changing, unknown jobs future was something new. “Every generation will have felt that way.”Were students graduating without the skills needed by employers? It was important not to confuse learning skills with content that becomes quickly outdated, said Kathy Armour, pro vice-chancellor (education) at the University of Birmingham, while Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor and chief executive of Aston University, said content matters but mainly as “the context around which you can develop skills and attributes”.The consensus was that whatever the future of work looked like, it would demand creativity.Julie Ward, Labour MEP for north-west England, stressed the importance of including arts in the emphasis on science, technology, engineering and mathematics as key subjects, so that Stem becomes Steam. Parents who advised their children that taking arts subjects would harm their job prospects were making a mistake, she said.Yvonne Brown, senior lecturer in management and human resources at Coventry University, said universities needed to ensure the way they assessed students encouraged teamwork and a creative approach to learning. It wasn’t just creativity that employers looked for, added Graham Thompsett, people capability director at Jaguar Land Rover – it was also curiosity. “There isn’t enough of that.”Mike Rowley, partner and head of education at KPMG, said his company did not focus on a particular degree or content but on softer skills, which he argued should be taught to students at an earlier stage in the education system.Work experience was essential in developing these skills, speakers agreed. Professor Philip Plowden, vice-chancellor of Birmingham City University, said work placements or experiential learning were invaluable in closing attainment gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged students. Not everyone approached the world of work from the same starting point: many students at Birmingham City came from deprived backgrounds and even short placements could help demystify office life and behaviour. “We talk about preparing students for an unknown future,” he said. “For a lot of my students it’s an unknown present.”Work placements had another value too – in preserving students’ innate abilities. “I think sometimes universities inadvertently stamp out creativity,” he suggested. “I have watched law students coming in with oodles of common sense from their everyday lives. You start teaching them and within about a year they can give you a lecture on contract law, but can’t solve a problem any more they could probably have solved when they came in.”Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said another way of equipping students with transferable skills was enabling them to work closely with researchers to become independent learners and researchers in their own right.But students needed to pick up more than learning skills from universities to have successful careers, argued Frances Howell, managing director and head of corporate banking Midlands Region, at HSBC. “Another thing that’s really important is around building the strength and skills of iniduals to manage mental wellbeing,” she said. Jason Arday, senior teaching fellow in the Centre for Education Studies at the University of Warwick, said students felt they were paying a lot of money to be at university and that had changed attitudes towards the skills institutions needed to deliver.But it was not all up to universities, said Thompsett. Employers needed to change too. This meant working more closely with universities to develop skills and find suitable – and erse – recruits.Plowden said he would “vehemently disagree” with any suggestion that universities were just about getting a job. But for Cameron it was “base level hygiene”. While he appreciated the sense of civic engagement, morals and values he derived from his university education, his ability to appreciate it all had been underpinned by the fact that he was employed, and universities failed their students if they did not give them that opportunity.For Sandy Lindsay, founder and chair at the communications consultancy Tangerine, apprenticeships offered one solution. She set up the Juice Academy, a digital marketing apprenticeship programme, because she felt digital marketing was too fast-changing to be taught at the slow pace of a university setting.Yet she felt the government’s current apprenticeship programme was a missed opportunity, lacking essential flexibility. And Plowden agreed that the bureaucracy involved was such that the apprenticeship system “makes us look like Usain Bolt”.Slowness was particularly problematic in the pace of change on ersity, argued Arday. He was concerned at the persistent attainment gap between white and black and minority ethnic students and felt this was reinforced by the dearth of people of colour in leadership positions in universities or industry. “We don’t have a model reflective of the student population,” he argued.But while many agreed that universities needed to be faster at responding to change, the solution was not just extra speed, countered Armour. She made the case for “slow learning”, rejecting the government’s enthusiasm for accelerated two-year courses in favour of a more modular approach, interspersed with periods of work. Why do we study for three years, she asked, rather than seven? “The idea that you will be able at 18 to study something and three years later you’ll have everything you need to take you through until you’re 75 is fanciful. If it ever were true it’s certainly not true now.”She predicted that universities would remain trusted providers of education but there would be new ways to package material into microchunks. Only a few years ago, music lovers could only buy records on an LP, but now most young people buy bits and pieces through iTunes, she said. “You can see a lot of students who might want to package their learning somewhat differently over a life course,” she said. “That seems to me where the future is.”Alec Cameron, vice-chancellor and chief executive professor of Aston UniversitySandy Lindsay, founder and chair at Tangerine \u0026amp The Juice AcademyFrances Howell, managing director and head of corporate banking, Midlands Region, HSBCPaul Faulkner, CEO, Birmingham Chamber of CommerceJulie Ward, Labour MEP for north-west EnglandMichael Rowley, partner and head of education, KPMGProfessor Philip Plowden, vice-chancellor of Birmingham City UniversityProfessor Kathy Armour, pro-vice-chancellor (education), University of BirminghamGraham Thompsett, people capability director, Jaguar Land RoverYvonne Browne, senior lecturer in management and human resources, Coventry University LondonJason Arday, senior teaching fellow in the Centre for Education Studies, University of WarwickSarah Stevens, head of policy, the Russell Group"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78938ac2710ad76dd0fd5fee401d4aa1d4a336c/0_43_5417_3250/master/5417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=633166e8941d1791f4862f1b98f7dbcd","title":"uk pupils climate change strike headteachers unions schools","story":"Unions urge pupils not to walk out of class but some schools may adopt relaxed attitudeSchool leaders are having to wrestle with their consciences over pupils joining the nationwide climate strike to be held on Friday afternoon, caught between their duties as teachers and instincts as educators.Thousands of the more than 8 million school pupils in the UK are expected to walk out of lessons to show their concern about the threat of escalating climate change.Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman and a former science teacher, said she will be joining a rally in Oxford and urged school leaders to accommodate pupils who join the protests.“As a former teacher I absolutely understand the frustrations that teachers and schools may have with these strikes. However, I would describe this as a teachable moment,” said Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon.“I hope schools, colleges and universities see this in the positive light it is meant and equally hope those students act sensibly with making sure adults know where they are and making up the missed work.”But the National Association of Head Teachers, which last week offered some support for those joining the strike, gave a more hard-headed assessment to its members as the day of the action approached.“Pupils should only be out of school in exceptional circumstances. Whilst NAHT supports the right of young people to express themselves, first and foremost, pupils should be in school during term time,” the union said.“While a school leader’s role is to ensure children attend school, are kept safe and receive a good quality of education, it is right that inidual school leaders can decide how best to respond to any proposed protest by students in their school on Friday.”The Department for Education’s guidance says unauthorised absences must be recorded as part of safeguarding, but gives room for headteachers to approve absences in “exceptional circumstances”.The organisers have written form letters for the parents of those wanting to take part, which argue that protesting qualifies as civic engagement and climate change is an exceptional circumstance.With the strike taking place on the final day before half-term holidays in many parts of England, some schools may adopt a relaxed attitude. But others have already informed their students any absence will be noted as unauthorised.Geoff Barton, a former secondary school headteacher who now leads the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “While we understand the strength of feeling over the very important issue of climate change, we would urge pupils against walking out of school on Friday.“It is extremely disruptive for a school to have to deal with unauthorised absences and pupils will be missing out on important learning time.”The day of action follows the example of Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl who began protesting outside her country’s parliament in August. Her solo effort has since grown and spread to countries around the world including Germany and Australia.In a letter to the , more than 200 UK academics said they offered “full support” to the school strikers. “They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b72a75f26de1130eac3446edc7651aee3e0ef27/0_391_5834_3501/master/5834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35449bf0c421b8592eeb9ea7bda6e228","title":"wildlife photographer year people choice winner in pictures","story":"David Lloyd’s Bond of Brothers, a heartwarming image of an affectionate pair of male lions, has been crowned the winner of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Lumix people’s choice award.

And the answers are always illuminating, given that these three remain among the most watched and beloved movies of all time. But were they recognised as such by the Academy? Were they billy-o. Instead, the winners those years were, respectively, Ordinary People (the ultimate downer movie no one would watch today by choice), Terms of Endearment (ditto) and Out of Africa (the definition of a movie that was very much of its time), while the movies that people still actually watch today were fobbed off with technical and sound nominations.Which brings me to Black Panther. There was something of a furore a few months ago when the Academy suggested bringing in an extra category, outstanding achievement in popular film, a clear acknowledgment that Black Panther should win best film, but won’t because, well, it’s no Ordinary People. (Although it could have been called Out of Africa, albeit this time focusing on actual black Africans instead of just white Europeans.) But people got very cross about this, and said the category was an insult to the Oscars, which are – and I quote one film commentator – “a celebration of excellence”. This person was presumably in a coma when Argo won. Anyway, the proposed new category was binned and, with it, Black Panther’s chances of going home with much more than best production design.I’m so tired of people acting like comedies and action movies are somehow less “excellent”, or artistic, or good, than self-conscious dramas full of Serious Actors doing their Serious Acting. Who, honestly, would argue that Trading Places is less excellent than Out of Africa, for heaven’s sake? Good action movies and comedies require so much skill, far more than simply looking moodily off into the middle distance and whacking Adagio in G Minor on the soundtrack. And if there’s any film that should hammer the nail into the coffin of this pervasive nonsense, it’s Black Panther.By anyone’s measure, Black Panther is a very good movie: gripping, smart, beautiful, fully engaged with modern issues, thrillingly zeitgeisty and with terrific performances, especially from Michael B Jordan and Letitia Wright. I am generally no fan of superhero movies, especially the way they now dominate the industry, squeezing out the mid-market. But if the Oscars are to survive at all, they need to be interesting to more people and the fact is the movies most people are currently interested in are superhero movies. Black Panther would be the perfect movie with which the Academy could acknowledge this, given that it is a superhero movie, but also Oscar-level good, a movie that’s a genuine artistic and political achievement. After all, it is that almost unknown thing, an American movie with a largely black cast that is about neither slavery nor poverty, and is celebratory rather than depressing. I am trying to think of another first American movie with an almost entirely black cast that became a global blockbuster, and all I can come up with is Coming to America, which came out 31 years ago.I know Black Panther won’t win, you know Black Panther won’t win – even Black Panther knows it won’t win. Even its nomination feels decidedly begrudging. But dammit, it should. It says something important about 2018 and it feels properly seminal. But fine, whatever, give the Oscar to the beautiful black and white movie or the funny historical romp. Because lord knows those types of movies never win, whereas action movies celebrating black people come along every month, right?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

I didn’t sign you to run around and then be tired after five minutes’,” recalls Marcus Antonsson. “First you think ‘woah, hang on’ but then you realise that he is very demanding and that you’re not going to get away with anything.”The manager who gave Antonsson a dressing down after his first few minutes as a Malmö FF player is Uwe Rösler, the German who has revitalised the club after being appointed in June 2018 and who is now preparing to face Chelsea in the Europa League on Thursday.Malmö FF were going nowhere when the former Brentford, Wigan and Leeds manager took over and shook up the club. Having won the Swedish title in 2017 they were mid-table with no signs of climbing the table by the time he arrived. He came with the backing of the former MFF coach Åge Hareide and, according to Swedish paper Aftonbladet, beat Ole Gunnar Solskjær, the current Manchester United manager, to the job.Rösler took one look at the squad, recognised the talent within it, and then started working on the players’ fitness. The results were remarkable. Malmö FF went undefeated in Rösler’s first 17 games, rose to third in the table and qualified for the Europa League last 32 by finishing above Besiktas in their group. This week Chelsea arrive at a sold-out Stadion.“The draw could not have been much harder,” concedes Antonsson, “but I guess the hope is that they will underestimate us somewhat. The key is to play a top, top game at home and then take it from there.”A feverish atmosphere will await Chelsea but Rösler is concerned of a backlash after the humiliation at the Etihad last Sunday, when Maurizio Sarri’s side lost 6-0.“Chelsea are like a wounded animal at the moment,” Rösler said this week. “It is an unusual situation for a club like Chelsea but I hope they arrive with all their star players. I hope that our supporters will be able to watch a world class team and that we can show how far we have got. For me, that’s our biggest challenge. It is a fantastic challenge and that’s the same for the players too.”Rösler, who is a former East German international who played for Manchester City between 1994 and 1998 and whose son, Colin plays for the U19s, had mixed success as a manager in England. He came close to winning promotion to the Championship with Brentford in 2013 but lost in the play-off final and left the club later in the year. At Wigan he beat Manchester City in the FA Cup but departed after 11 months in the job and the club in the Championship relegation zone.He won only two out of 12 games in charge of Leeds United while he achieved Fleetwood’s highest position ever by coming fourth in League One before being sacked in February 2018 after seven straight defeats.At Malmö, he has impressed with his tactical flexibility and his ability to change formation depending on the opponents. “The more I think about it, the more I like a back three,” he told fotbollskanalen recently, before adding: “but then I’ve used 4-4-2 with a diamond, a straight 4-4-2, 4-2-3-1 …”Rösler is happy to take his inspiration from a broad range of coaches and said last year: “I like how Jürgen Klopp’s teams play football as a general rule. I like Pep Guardiola’s beautiful football. I like Mourinho cynicism and, finally, Otto Rehhagel’s management style.”The key for Malmö, however, has been the improvement in fitness. They have not played a competitive game since beating Besiktas away on 13 December but the German has worked his players hard in the last four weeks, culminating in a brutal training camp in Marbella.The key player is without doubt the now 36-year-old Markus Rosenberg, who some people in England may remember from a less than successful spell at West Brom between 2012-14. He leads from the front, never giving the defenders any rest (although there were raised eyebrows in Sweden when David Luiz described him as a “fantastic” player).For Malmö the game has added poignancy as their chairman Håkan Jeppsson died in early December. Rösler is pensive as he talks about the man who was part of Malmö’s board for 14 years and who oversaw the club’s return to the top of the Swedish game in the past decade. “I still spend a lot of time thinking about Håkan,” Rösler said recently. “I don’t know because I did not know him for a long period of time, but it is refusing to go away.”The victory against Besiktas the week after the death of Jeppsson in December, which ultimately set up the Chelsea tie, was dedicated to the former chairman and for the first home game since his passing away, players and fans will want to make it a night to remember."},{"url":null,"title":"how might brexit affect premier league","story":"The FA is calling for a reduction in the number of foreign players in the Premier League. Here’s how each team could be affectedBrexit-anxiety has engulfed businesses across the UK over the past few months, and when it comes to English football, the Premier League is not shielded from the uncertainty. For decades, England’s top tier has become increasingly international, with clubs sourcing the best talent from around the world. But this has meant playing time has been reduced for English players, something that hasn’t sat well with the game’s governing body.The FA sees Brexit as a chance to increase the number of English players in the Premier League, which it says will boost the chances of the national team by exposing more players to the best football. But the Premier League has rejected this view, saying there is “no evidence” it would work.As part of their plan, the FA has called for a cut in the maximum number of non-homegrown players allowed in each team’s 25-player squad from 17 to 12.A “homegrown” player is currently defined as one that’s been registered with the FA for at least three years before they turn 21, regardless of nationality.It’s a rule that’s allowed Manchester United’s Paul Pogba to qualify as homegrown, because he first signed at Old Trafford as a 16-year-old. The FA is also considering reducing this age by which players must have three years of association with the FA to 18. While plenty of negotiations between the FA and the Premier League remain, few teams would be unaffected by the rule changes floated.The Premier League’s on-the-pitch-product has led to soaring revenues off-the pitch, and the Premier League is by far the richest league in the world with revenues reaching £4.5bn for 2016-17. Additionally, eight of the world’s 20 richest clubs are English, and the Premier League fears that stricter quotas on non-homegrown players would hit those clubs by making them less competitive. Brexit could mean players from EU and European Economic Area countries are subject to the same, visa and work permit restrictions as players from countries outside the EU, making the criteria for signing players stricter and making it harder for teams to trade. This year’s January transfer window was noticeably slower compared to a year ago, which could signal, among other reasons, that teams are keeping a watchful eye on Brexit developments, and are reluctant to spend large sums of money on players they may be forced to sell. In the bigger picture, the managers are themselves ided. Jürgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, said Brexit “makes no sense”. But on the other hand Neil Warnock, manager of Premier League Cardiff City, said he couldn’t wait to get out of the EU.With just 43 days until the UK is due to leave the EU, time is running out for the FA to find a balanced deal that not only promotes the prospects of English players, but also one that protects the immense wealth of its prized asset, the Premier League."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27bbf9b0d0daa06509a2a4754fcd1c587b3b777a/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb389ec78b5ae255879f3efbe6727616","title":"four day working week share your experiences and views","story":"We would like to explore the idea from your perspective, whether you are an employee, employer or policy expertMoving to a four day week: is it the ideal way to achieve a better work-life balance or simply a luxury incompatible with the modern world? We’re looking to explore questions around the idea and gather your perspectives for an upcoming article.In September, the head of the TUC said advances in technology mean that a four-day week working week is a realistic goal for most people by the end of this century. “We can win a four-day working week, with decent pay for everyone,” Frances O’Grady said. But is that really attainable? And should this be the focus of how we change the way we work?Several readers with experience of the policy reacted to a related opinion piece by saying that they were happier working four day weeks, with one saying the move was “one of the best decisions I have ever made. I recommend it to everybody.” Others said they wished their companies would take the idea more seriously, but there were mixed views on how best it can be implemented.We would like to hear more of your views and experiences on four day working weeks, whether or not you are an employee or an employer at a company or organisation implementing or exploring the idea.Whatever your experience or opinions, tell us about them in the form below.

You would have been a fool to bet against her original shtick being huge in 2002. An era in which Busted bestrode teenage affections like a tri-headed, invariably gurning colossus was clearly ripe for a Canadian teen dressed as a schoolgirl, sticking her tongue out, doing devil-horn fingers and peddling battery-farmed pop-punk aimed squarely at teens. And it was huge: her debut album Let Go sold 16m copies. Equally, however, you would have been brave to bet on Avril Lavigne hanging around. You could marvel at the precision-tooling that went into Sk8er Boi without thinking it was necessarily the stuff on which protracted careers were founded. A gap in the market had been identified and exploited, a great deal of money made, and its audience were bound to grow up and move on, right?Wrong. Seventeen years on from Let Go and here we are, staring down the barrel of Lavigne’s sixth album. How has she survived, even flourished, when the careers of most 2002 teen sensations – and indeed the pop-punk bands that provided her initial inspiration – have withered? In the interim, certain adjustments have been made. Her albums now sell only in vast quantities, rather than figures that make you think there’s been a misprint. Her image has shifted. You can’t go on dressing like a schoolgirl and sticking your tongue out indefinitely, although Lavigne kept at it longer than you might imagine, bolstered by her 2007 single Girlfriend, a Chinn and Chapman-esque burst of bubblegum so brilliant it would have been a huge hit at any point in the last 50 years. By contrast, Head Above Water arrives with a cover that offers us Avril Lavigne, serious singer-songwriter, naked but for an acoustic guitar, a stock signifier of unvarnished honesty that, for some inexplicable reason, male singer-songwriters are never impelled to use to prove their sincerity.In a sense, this approach returns Lavigne to her roots. Like a millennial equivalent of Gryphon, the medievally inclined prog band whose members ditched their crumhorns and regrouped as the Banned when punk hit, she was originally signed as a country-ish singer-songwriter, before someone noticed that Blink-182 were selling millions. Head Above Water’s title track, meanwhile, has been a big hit on US Christian radio, hailed as a powerful worship ballad: Lavigne’s career began with her performing alongside a Christian singer called Stephen Medd.The reviewers at Faithwire and Christian Headlines have a point. Head Above Water is powerful, in a big old MOR power-ballad way. In fact, what the yanks call adult contemporary is very much the album’s most successful mode: it’s at its best when Lavigne and her co-writers forget about trends and roll out the booming drums and the kind of air-punching choruses you could imagine Heart singing in their garagantuan-haired 80s heyday. No one is ever going to describe the results as hip, but It Was in Me and Warrior are ruthlessly well-written, they fit Lavigne’s voice and the soldier-on lyrical sentiment is given a little edge by the album’s backstory. Head Above Water was inspired by Lavigne’s battle with Lyme disease, the tick-bourne infection to which she succumbed shortly after her 30th birthday and, she has said, nearly killed her.It’s on substantially shakier ground when it tries to apply the pragmatic thinking that led Lavigne to co-opt pop-punk to what’s in vogue today. The sentiment behind Dumb Blonde – female empowerment anthemics featuring a guest appearance from Nicki Minaj and a guitar part that sounds like Stevie Nicks’ Edge of Seventeen – is inarguable, but it feels flat and rote. You could point out that Lavigne’s brand of empowerment doesn’t seem terribly empowering, relying as it does on reinforcing a lot of grim stereotypes about other women being dumb blonds and “stupid Barbie dolls”, but it hardly seems worth it clearly no one involved in its manufacture considered the song that carefully. The problem with the album’s dabblings in chart pop à la Taylor Swift (Souvenir, Goddess, Bigger Wow) and post-Amy Winehouse retro-soul (Tell Me It’s Over) isn’t that the songs are poor, or that Lavigne can’t manage the stylistic shifts. It’s more that she doesn’t impose herself on them – they could be by anyone. You struggle to identify exactly what she’s bringing to the party beyond a knowledge of which way the commercial wind is blowing.The end result isn’t bad, but it is uneven. For all the talk of Lavigne finally writing her life and telling her story it’s hard not to come away thinking that her heart lies more with the power ballads than the lunges for commercial contemporaneity. They are the songs that hit hardest and stick around. Still, the other stuff has its role to play, not least in answering our initial question. Why is Avril Lavigne still here? Perhaps because she’s more adaptable.Unknown artist: Shelved Recordings #1Two 12-ins in a generic sleeve with no track titles or details at all turn out to be luscious re-edits of obscure 80s pop tracks, smooth and weird in equal measure.

Scroll down to read all of his responses.Thank you very much for sending the questions in - I hope they haven\u0027t depressed you too much. And yeah, I hope you enjoy the new album, if you\u0027re going to buy it.UncleZippy asks: Why are you either so self-deprecating or comically cocky about your work? Did you grow up feeling ashamed about being creative?No, I grew up having no confidence whatsover in my abilities. I had confidence in my ideas but not my abilities. But also, I don\u0027t want to brag about it, I don\u0027t want to appear overly confident about it - I think that\u0027s really offputting.You went to stage school. Can you tell us about that?I did Theatre Studies at A level. I tried to get into Rada, the lot, any that would have me, but I couldn\u0027t get in. I spent a year doing auditions, and I realised it would take another two or three years to get any kind of result –\u0026nbspso I went into music instead.Did you ever visit the old Robin Hood visitor centre in Nottingham? I went in there tripping on shrooms and the papier mache headed Middle Ages blokes sat round in the tavern will last with me forever.No I don\u0027t, no. I\u0027ve never gone in. But that must have been amazing.Would you take on a sponsor for live shows if it meant you could put on the whole lighting rig stuff and video wallsvisuals, or are the crates and laptop a part of your signature?Yeah., we\u0027re not really into visuals. They look terrible. And to be honest I don\u0027t know why other bands haven\u0027t caught onto the idea of not using them. Even having your name behind you is a no-no. The music should carry itself. And I understand that a lot of bands\u0027 music isn\u0027t carried very well, so they need all the help they can get. But we are looking into lighting ideas - people are saying a minimal lighting show could add a nice touch to it. But big stage shows, stupid, they really do take away from it.You’ve not put a foot wrong these last few years – how do you keep pushing forward in such a consistent manner? Admittedly, the utter shitshow we have to endure gives you loads of material, but isn’t that true for every band?Bands have got different agendas, it just so happens that ours is... I don\u0027t know! You can\u0027t put it into words. But it\u0027s nice you think that. A lot of people don\u0027t. It\u0027s loads of different things that have made it what it is.Who cut your hair, the council?Who cut my hair, the council? No. And I\u0027ve not got that haircut any more - the straight fringe is a young person\u0027s game. It\u0027s not something I want to carry into my 50s - it would look like a toupee. Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with toupees. I just thought I\u0027d get rid of it.MYCohen asks:1. How important is money?2. What’s your favourite Fall track?How important is money? Of course it\u0027s important. I\u0027ve got a mortgage to pay and we need to eat, and because of that it\u0027s important. If you\u0027re talking about a gig being attractive for a lot of money, it depends - we do a lot of gigs where we don\u0027t earn a lot, and it\u0027s nice to be paid more than you usually do. Would I sell out for £2m quid? No I wouldn\u0027t. Well actually, it depends on the level of sell-out. But as a rule. NoThe Fall: Industrial Estate, I thought that was good. People compare us to them so much, so I don\u0027t listen to them too much in case we pick them up. But god rest his soul - he was a man who stuck to his formula and you\u0027ve got to respect that.Your music is so full of hate, have you ever thought of being constructive for a change? Perhaps sing about solutions, not your spite?No, we don\u0027t sing about solutions. I would find that really patronising. There is no answer. Life is chaotic the human form is chaotic. As Alan Moore once said, we\u0027re speeding towards a brick wall in a fast car. We\u0027re animals. There are no solutions. But this music isn\u0027t hate music at all. It\u0027s good street music. And on the street, it\u0027s never nice. Regular life for the most part is pretty crap, and this is what it talks about.How difficult has it been to keep reacting to events given how fast everything moves now?It hasn\u0027t really. You do an album, and you have a cooling off period, and you start again. And your idea of how you want to communicate that, connects to it. It\u0027s not majorly difficult, you just have to be honest with yourself brush by any notion of addressing something in a cliched or obvious way, and think about how you\u0027re going to propose a point on a stage that is powerful. So no. I\u0027ve got a lot of time to think about it, and after each year we\u0027re ready to start again. It marries itself to current issues, because current issues are still unbelievably bad, and will carry on like that.Hi, I’m a 21 year old that’s grown up poor in the depressing, expensive Tory heartland of Surrey. A lot of my mates are turning very right wing, regurgitating whatever they’ve read from social media, and the heavy lefties seem to be equally shallow and militant. Any help? I can\u0027t give you any help, I\u0027m sorry. I just can\u0027t. What do you do? Just carry on. And try to question everything. It\u0027s interesting you have equal scorn for the left as the right, as that\u0027s how it\u0027s getting - people are just pulling things out of books and saying things for effect. But I don\u0027t have any answers for you, I\u0027m sorry.Do you envisage a time when Sleaford Mods will have run its course, or are you happy to be like the Rolling Stones?I dunno. Not sure. I think me and Andrew constantly think if its decent any more, but every time we record an album, it\u0027s good. It\u0027s not boring yet, but what can you do - I do worry about it a lot, but it\u0027s still good. And it\u0027s only really five years old in a commercial sense. I\u0027ve just got to ignore all that - it\u0027s moved on enough to justify carrying on. We certainly don\u0027t repeat ourselves, and I like to think the subject matter, although it is largely talking about similar themes, is addressed differently on each album. There will come a time where we might feel slightly out of sync, but that hasn\u0027t happened yet. It depends how we play it. The main thing is that we\u0027re honest with ourselves. We\u0027re still really happy with it. It\u0027s bulletproof.Jason, you gave up alcohol a couple of years back. You’ve mentioned that this has helped you get in physical shape. But did it affect your creativity – is writing lyrics harder now? No, it\u0027s easier. Because I haven\u0027t got drug comedowns and hangovers to deal with, I haven\u0027t got guilt to deal with, any what did I do? stuff to deal with. I\u0027m not arguing as much, I\u0027m not paranoid, and every day is nice. I get up and I\u0027m alright. So it\u0027s easier to write stuff and motivate yourself - previously I was languishing in self-pity and utter confusion.How hard is to keep the lyrics real in this time of political correctness when everybody’s so easily offended?Well, I don\u0027t think we\u0027re overtly offensive, apart from swear words and criticism of whoever. I\u0027m sure most of the lyrics get laughed off by whatever target, it\u0027s how it is isn\u0027t it? There\u0027s far more offensive bands to be looking at really, who do keep well within the realms of political correctness. It\u0027s easy - just carry on.Why were you supporting the Who at Hyde Park a few years back? Someone thought you were a mod band perhaps?No - the promoter of the festival was someone who really liked us and asked us to come along. And to be honest, if there was ever a band that was tied in with the idea of it, it would be us - I\u0027ll take that, thank you very much!D’you reckon the Brits are rigged? Or just shit?They\u0027re not rigged - they just don\u0027t let bands in who the label sponsors don\u0027t have a financial interest in. So that\u0027s why it\u0027s not as interesting as it mildly was 25 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b347cbf0236da29cb3581d5e45fcc140fceb1de9/0_0_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d18844848b79d1be00a73e7e1c882fd","title":"a week at guantanamo bay today in focus podcast","story":"’s Julian Borger recently spent a week at the Guantánamo Bay detention facility, attending the 33rd pre-trial hearing of five 911 suspects.

But anti-Brexit MPs believe it is time to shift the policy towards supporting a referendum, as May has rejected Labour’s advances by continuing to rule out a customs union.Some see Starmer as the most likely champion for their cause inside the shadow cabinet. Other key figures, including Trickett and the Labour chair, Ian Lavery, are more sceptical.Attention is focusing on plans made by the Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, under which parliament’s endorsement of a deal would be made subject to the public’s approval, echoing the model pursued for the Good Friday agreement.“That’s where the action is,” said one backbencher. There could also be a straightforward “people’s vote” amendment when May brings an amendable vote to MPs on 27 February.Several frontbenchers, including the shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, and the shadow business minister, Chi Onwurah, will speak at a Love Socialism, Hate Brexit rally at parliament before the vote on Thursday. The rally is being promoted by the pro-referendum group Another Europe is Possible.Lewis previously quit as shadow defence secretary in order to rebel against the triggering of article 50, but has since returned to the Labour frontbench.He said last week: “I’m on the frontbench because I live in hope that the party will get to the bit of our conference policy where it supports a people’s vote.”Even some shadow frontbenchers opposed to a second referendum are coming to the view that the party needs a “cathartic moment” to whip for a new referendum and prove that the plan has no parliamentary majority, with more than 20 Labour MPs likely to oppose. One sceptical shadow minister said the February deadline would be the time for “peak agitation”.Tensions over the party’s Brexit policy have been simmering since Corbyn made his offer of a Brexit compromise in a letter to May last week, prompting former leadership candidate Owen Smith to suggest he could quit the party if Labour eventually backed a Brexit deal.Anger spilled into the open on Wednesday. The MP Neil Coyle claimed the party was losing members and councillors, and could yet lose MPs over its Brexit policy.One Labour MP, Geraint Davies, tabled an amendment attempting to bring forward the crunch point for the Labour leadership by calling for a referendum on May’s deal but it was not directly connected with that of Kyle and Wilson. “It’s very premature,” one MP said.Davies’ amendment, which he submitted on Wednesday, will be attached to a government motion laying out the next stage of Brexit negotiations. MPs are due to vote on the motion on Thursday.Davies said his amendment would help build support for another legally binding amendment on a second referendum at the next opportunity.“There is a hidden majority in the house that want to support this position, but they are all waiting around for some guiding north star for them to follow before they take action, but we are running out of time,” he said. “MPs are in danger of being complicit if they do not take action now.”But Kyle said he was not behind Davies’ amendment and had hoped to wait until there was more momentum behind the move.“The main push for this will be the meaningful vote. Clearly the landscape changes but this vote tomorrow is not binding and this amendment should not be interpreted as the main bid for support,” he said.Corbyn was criticised for failing to take tougher action against MPs who declined to back Yvette Cooper’s amendment aimed at averting a no-deal Brexit but chief whip Nick Brown has made clear to MPs he would deal with all Brexit votes in the round, at the end of the process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43964ba111997373586560c048d00d49d1078dd7/218_0_3258_1956/master/3258.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=640d463b3df4c8a31772c08b84e0f7b2","title":"greg clark accused of misleading mps over 61m payment to nissan","story":"Labour says business secretary ‘dodged scrutiny’ by failing to tell parliament about state aidLabour has accused the business secretary, Greg Clark, of misleading MPs by failing to tell parliament that a £61m package of state aid had been granted to Nissan, despite assuring the Commons that he would do so.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said that as a result the cabinet minister had “dodged scrutiny” over the promises he had made to Nissan in October 2016 to boost manufacturing in Sunderland after Brexit.At the time Clark had refused to say exactly what assurances he had given Nissan, even saying there was “no chequebook” involved, despite intense pressure on him to reveal how he had persuaded the company to demonstrate confidence in the UK.The business secretary promised MPs from the floor of the Commons that any offer of taxpayer support for Nissan would ultimately be reported to parliament once it had formally been agreed, in remarks seized upon by Labour.Clark said on 31 October 2016 that all proposals for state aid were “subject to rigorous external scrutiny” by the independent Industrial Development Advisory Board (IDAB) and were reported on to parliament.A package worth £61m was ultimately granted to Nissan in June 2018, but it was kept secret until earlier this month, when the Japanese car maker changed its mind, and decided it would not make the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland after all.Long-Bailey said: “The government has dodged scrutiny of the assurances it gave to Nissan ever since it was first brought to light. While Labour is in favour of supporting UK industry, we do not support sweetheart deals with no strategy or transparency.”Clark has said that Nissan would have to reapply for state aid after abandoning its commitment to make the X-Trail in Sunderland, which had it gone ahead would have created 740 jobs at the Sunderland plant, which employs 7,000 people.Long-Bailey also wrote a letter to Clark, accusing him of failing “to keep your own promise to Nissan” and called on him to “demand that the prime minister rules out a no-deal Brexit – a promise we know you have made abundantly clear in private and must now have the guts to make in public”.Car makers have repeatedly warned of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, with Ford and Toyota and the trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders among those who have gone public with their concerns.Last week, Rachel Reeves, the chair of the business select committee, extracted a promise from Clark that he would in future notify the committee every time a company had been granted a state aid package.A total of £150m in state aid to car makers, including Toyota, Ford and BMW has also been granted without MPs being made aware of them, in a wide-ranging programme to help key manufacturers retain confidence in the UK after the country leaves the European Union.Richard Harrington, a junior business minister, confirmed in a written answer that while the £61m package was scrutinised by the IDAB, parliament was not notified.The junior minister added: “There is no obligation to do so when he acts in accordance with their recommendation.”• This article was amended on 14 February 2019. An earlier version mistakenly said Clark had said Nissan would not have to reapply for state aid. This has been corrected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/545dcd3ba148179e4f7724a7600e55b29bac07f1/0_150_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2b9b4918b5e981647c1b3d83f984767","title":"nasa makes final attempt to communicate with mars rover opportunity","story":"Robot the size of a golf buggy has sent data to Earth for 15 years but fell silent eight months ago and Nasa says mission is completeNasa declared the 15-year mission of the veteran Mars rover Opportunity finally over on Wednesday, crediting the robot as having “transformed our understanding of our planet”.The golf buggy-sized vehicle last made contact with Earth eight months ago, after being caught in a global dust storm.Announcing the mission’s end, Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at Nasa, said the rover had “remained silent” after a last-ditch effort to contact Opportunity on Tuesday.Despite the loss, the mood at the press conference at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, was one of celebration on Wednesday.“I’m standing here with a sense of deep appreciation and gratitude to declare the Opportunity mission as complete,” Zurbuchen said.“It transformed our understanding of our planet, everything we do and think about in our planetary neighborhood with Mars and elsewhere relates to the research from that and the engineering breakthroughs that came from that.”Opportunity landed on Mars in January 2004 shortly after its twin – a rover called Spirit. Together, the pair were part of Nasa’s Mars Exploration Rover programme. However, the Spirit got stuck in soil in 2009 and was declared defunct in 2011.By contrast, Opportunity has continued to trundle over the surface of Mars and send back data to Earth, acting as a sort of remote geologist.John Callas, Mars Exploration Rover project manager, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said that epic journey had been due to a “phenomenal” effort and had “greatly expanded our understanding of the red planet”.Over the 15 years it has spent on Mars, Opportunity has clocked up more than 45km (28 miles) – despite being designed to travel only 1,006 metres and last 90 Martian days.“We had expected that dust falling out of the air would accumulate on the solar rays and eventually choke off power,” Callas said.“What we didn’t expect was that wind would come along periodically and blow the dust off the arrays.“It allowed us to survive not just the first winter, but all the winters we experienced on Mars.”Opportunity was finally done in by a “historic” dust storm, said Abigail Fraeman, MER deputy project scientist. Fraeman said the storm had turned the sky so dark that Opportunity “couldn’t see the sun and the solar panels couldn’t recharge the battery”.During its mission, the rover found tiny iron-rich spheres nicknamed “blueberries” at the crater that suggested a wet past, while its analyses of clay minerals near the Endeavour crater confirmed parts of Mars were once covered in neutral water, and could have been a habitable environment. It also came across the first meteorite ever to be discovered on another planet. In addition, the rover has sent back stunning images, including capturing a Martian “dust devil” twisting across the planet’s surface and panoramic shots that provided breathtaking views of Martian craters.Another aspect of Opportunity’s legacy is the number of people who were inspired to pursue careers in science through following the rover’s trek, Fraeman said.“There really are hundreds if not thousands of students who, just like me, witnessed these rovers and followed along their mission, from the images released to the public over the last 15 years and then because of that went on to pursue careers in science.”“It has been a fantastically successful mission which has completely outlived its shelf life,” said Professor Andrew Coates, a planetary scientist at University College London’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory.“One of those core things about Opportunity was it landed in this crater which was in sight of sedimentary types of rocks and that was the first time that sort of thing had been seen on Mars,” said Coates. “People compared it at the time to an interplanetary hole in one.”Professor John Bridges from the University of Leicester, who is part of the team working on Nasa’s continuing Curiosity rover project and the European Space Agency’s ExoMars mission, said Opportunity had a fantastic roll call of achievements. He added that with its twin the rover had been key in changing the idea of Mars from being a lump of basalt in space to having a very different geological history, showing the importance of lakes and other features.Coates, who is also lead scientist for the panoramic camera instrument on the ExoMars rover – recently named Rosalind Franklin – which is set to be launched in 2020, said the discoveries of Opportunity, and later the Curiosity rover, have been important for the development of new missions.“The next step now of course is to drill and look for signs of life, and that is exactly what we are doing with the ExoMars rover, drilling up to 2 metres underneath the surface,” he said.The final attempt at communication with Opportunity on Tuesday night was, it seems, an emotional affair. Dr Tanya Harrison, a planetary scientist who worked on the mission, tweeted: “There were tears. There were hugs. There were memories and laughs shared.”Mike Seibert, who was also part of the team, paid tribute to the rover nicknamed “Oppy”, saying “Goodbye old friend” and noting that the rover was the longest lasting surface mission yet.Coates said Opportunity’s demise was bittersweet. “It is a matter of both celebration for what it was able to achieve and in the broad context of Mars exploration, but also tinged with sadness, losing an old friend.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01b6fa0e9fe3312bef9bdeb24b3d38eb44d2ed0c/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9187898fb91f541c1d46ceb0da251738","title":"dont use moisturiser and stop over exfoliating 10 beauty rules for your best ever skin","story":"Want to take your complexion to the next level? Three skin experts share their dos and don’ts for clear, glowing skinFeed your skinDid you know we all have our own skin flora? “Bacteria, yeast and viruses make up our skin microbiome,” says Pfeffer. “You want to foster and encourage your healthy microbiome to flourish and be at its most erse. By doing this, those microorganisms will protect your skin from infection, pollutants and pathogens which contribute to ageing, acne and eczema.”Pfeffer recommends using pH-balanced skincare, as anything too harsh, such as alcohol or soap, can destroy the bacteria. “Incorporate probiotics into your routine inside and out!” she adds.Ramp up your hydrationIt’s old news that drinking water is good for us, but did you know you can supercharge the hydration benefits of your H2O? “Drinking water is important, however, you may find you still feel dehydrated externally,” says Reynolds. Sound familiar? “Add ionic mineral drops to your water, as this will hydrate you at the cellular level. It is important for cell turnover and communication sometimes drinking water alone doesn’t cut it.”Take care of your productsDon’t just focus on looking after your complexion – your products need care too. “Active ingredients can be unstable and have an expiration date for a reason out-of-date products aren’t going to perform at their optimum and could even cause skin irritation,” says Pfeffer. “Check how the product should be stored, too – lots of ingredients can be denatured by sunlight so it’s best to keep them in a cool, dark cabinet. What if there’s a textural change or a funny smell? Play it safe and don’t apply.”Use retinol at night“Retinol is an anti-ageing superstar,” says Kerr. “It is a cell communicator that can attach to most skin cells, telling them to behave like younger, healthier versions of themselves.”Retinol is best used at night when the skin is “more active and in repair mode”, adds Kerr. Because retinol is a seriously active ingredient, start slow with a low percentage a few nights a week and work your way up in strength and frequency.Incorporate PHA into your routinePolyhydroxy acids (PHAs) are the new “it” exfoliating acid on the beauty block and because they are gentle, everyone can benefit from them (even if you have sensitive, dry or rosacea-prone skin). “PHAs are humectants, which means they have the ability to attract moisture which hydrates the skin. They also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits,” says Kerr. “Plus, if used regularly they can strengthen barrier function, making the skin stronger and more resilient, giving you more of that sought-after glow.”Stop applying products in the wrong orderYou need to think about product penetration when applying your skincare. “The biggest mistake I see people make is using a balm or oil cleanser, then applying a water-based serum. Water floats on top of oil – that serum isn’t going anywhere near your skin,” says Kerr. Apply your products from thinnest in consistency to thickest and “always apply sunscreen last”, adds Kerr.Stop over-exfoliatingSkin experts have differing views on this one, but Reynolds doesn’t believe we should be excessively exfoliating. “The skin’s microbiome and lipid barrier can be disrupted by aggressive exfoliating, leading to inflammation,” she says. Aim to exfoliate twice a week. If you feel your skin can handle more, that’s OK, but proceed with some caution.Stop using moisturiserCurveball! “It has been ingrained in us from a young age to cleanse, tone and moisturise. But our skin is capable of maintaining its own hydration levels – only a true dry skin type needs moisturiser,” says Kerr. “When we use moisturiser, our skin’s surface sends a signal down to its water reservoirs that there is plenty of moisture and to halt production. This makes the skin sluggish and lacking in moisture, so we reach for more moisturiser.“Breaking the cycle wakes up the skin’s natural moisturising processes, not only hydrating the skin but helping to balance oil production, preventing congestion. You’ll notice a brightening of the complexion and slower rate of skin ageing.” Give it a go and you should start to see a difference in two to three weeks.Stop ignoring instructions“The biggest mistake is overusing something if it works,” says Reynolds. If that retinol is making your skin glow, then the temptation is to go to town. “Remember, the ingredients in products that give the wow factor can also create an imbalance if over used. Stick to the instructions.”Stop cleansing with oilsBalm and oil cleansers may feel luxurious, but Kerr says “oils congest the skin, upset our own moisturising processes and prevent product penetration”. Not ready to give up your balm or oil cleanser? Be sure to double cleanse to remove any oil residue that could prevent your pricey serums from penetrating.Be your healthy best with Nature’s BountyBeauty starts from within.

From gardening ‘workouts’ to training with Serena Williams, there are ways to be frugal and fitIf getting fit is up there on your 2019 to-do list, then you may be tempted to stump up the cash for a pricey gym membership. Instead, why not explore the fitness workouts you can do for free?When it comes to getting fit, Louise Parker, author of Louise Parker: The 6 Week Programme (£20, Mitchell Beazley) and founder of the Louise Parker Method, believes the route to success is consistency, so, whether or not you’re paying for your workout, bear that in mind. “Stick to a routine, even if the time varies,” says Parker. “I get home, tend to the kids and then it’s yoga mat out for a quick cardio workout and job done. It’s not severe or gruelling, so I never dread it. It’s consistent and so it works.”Luke Worthington, human movement and elite performance specialist, agrees: “As a trainer, one of the most common questions I get asked is: ‘What’s the best programme for *insert goal here*?’ The answer, almost always, is the one that you will stick to. Adherence and consistency (and, therefore, motivation) are the most important considerations when embarking on an exercise regime.”Below are five free workout ideas. All you need to do is commit, workout, then repeat.Running is one of the most affordable ways to get fit. To start with, you really don’t need a lot of expensive kit a pair of running shoes – and, for women, a sports bra – is all you need to get started. If you’re totally new to running, try downloading the C25K 5K Trainer app (iTunes or Android, free), which will get you running the distance in just eight weeks. Once you’ve mastered a 5k, why not seek out your local Parkrun? The free Saturday morning race is timed, so you can keep track of your progress week after week.If you live near the countryside, or you fancy heading off for an active break, then why not seek out the UK’s best hiking routes? Walking is a low-impact exercise – you’re less likely to get injured from a jaunt across the countryside than doing something more intense. You’ll be burning calories and working those muscles, all the while distracted by the scenic views. Head to nationaltrailthe-trails to discover some of the best walking routes our country has to offer.We all know that gym memberships can cost an arm and a leg, and while there are now more affordable options that don’t tie you in, they still involve a monthly outlay. Our Parks offers free workouts, from boxfit and boot camps to yoga and Zumba, in parks up and down the country. Simply set up an online account and book a class near you.If you like the idea of being outside, but you’re not a fan of workout classes, then Green Gym could be for you. It’s a charity organisation that gets volunteers gardening their way to fitness. Each session involves a warm-up and cool down, but the bulk of the “workout” is gardening.Fitness Blender is a website devoted to free workouts of varying lengths and for different abilities – choose from barre, cardio and strength training, plus many more. It’s this decade’s answer to the workout DVD.If you travel a lot and want to exercise on the go, then download the Nike Training Club app (iTunes and Android, free) it’s essentially like having Nike’s best trainers and athletes – such as Serena Williams and Cristiano Ronaldo – in your pocket. It boasts more than 100 workouts, including core strength, abs and arms, and glute toner.Don’t think you have the willpower or motivation to work out at home? Anna Samuels, boxing trainer and the BoxxMethod co-founder suggests treating your at-home workout like you would a gym class or personal training session. “Book out time in your diary to do it, otherwise there is always the risk of putting it off until later. With the right mindset and planning, you will find the motivation to start, and with consistency it will become a habit.”OK, this is slightly unusual, but ecstatic dance – where you move to music in any way you please – frees you from confusing routines so you can lose yourself in the rhythm. You don’t need to head to a pricey class instead, load up Spotify or iTunes with your favourite, energy-boosting tunes and dance like no one’s watching. The benefits? It’s free, it burns calories and can even relieve stress.

Here he is, having coffee on the corner of Bowery and Bleecker … with the British media.We’ve been talking about the former Sale, Northampton and England full-back’s first few weeks with his new club, Rugby United New York, and about Major League Rugby, in which RUNY are one of nine professional teams.Foden is enthusiastic about an opening win in San Diego and a trip to New Orleans to come. He happily discusses the standard of play – “top of the Championship” – and the challenge of starting with five road games in a row.New York isn’t fit for outdoor sport until at least mid-March and partially as a result RUNY players are always on the move: weights in Long Island City, training indoors in Brooklyn, promotional work in Manhattan. Home games will be at a ballpark in Coney Island, the first of which will be on 15 March against the Toronto Arrows. Foden, who has signed up for two years, playing and coaching, seems delighted with it all but one off-field thing has inevitably palled: the attentions of the British tabloids. Last summer, roaring headlines announced Foden’s split from Una Healy, once of the group The Saturdays and mother of his two young children.“At the moment anything that’s published about me is never very good,” he says, “and pretty rightly so because I was the one who committed adultery.“But at the same time, it wasn’t the only reason for our orce to go through. It’s not ideal, but we’re very amicable, we’re getting through it, we’re not the first people in the world to get orced. We’ve got two little kids we adore.”There is an experience familiar to all who come to live in New York: a moment among the towers in the financial district, say, or wandering around midtown, when the sheer alien enormity of the place suddenly sinks in. Foden, who was supposed to be here with his wife and children, admits to a fiercely concentrated version. This is no village outside Northampton. He’s been in the country three weeks, he’s already flown to the west coast and back for a game and there are more long trips to come: Seattle, Houston, Austin, Colorado, Utah, Toronto.There is a sense Foden, for all his media-savvy confidence and conviviality, might have been a little caught out by it all. As we talk the snow outside turns to freezing rain and he admits he only packed one coat. True New Yorkers wear three at a time.“It’s hard because I’m away from my son and daughter,” he says, with a sigh. “But I know they’re in a great and loving environment with Una because she’s a great mum. We never argue about that.”FaceTime and WhatsApp are in play and, he says, he and his ex do not argue about much, even the recent mortifying instance in which the Sun published his profile from Bumble, an internet dating site.“I’ll tell you the real story behind that,” he says, with a slightly more caustic laugh. “I picked up Una from the airport a couple of weeks after we’d first been here, and we were sort of joking about dating. So I loaded up Bumble, and we did the profile together, joking around. And then I realised something dodgy was going on with it and the next day it was all over the paper.“It’s not ideal, but at least I can laugh about it and especially so with Una. If she hadn’t known about it I can see it would have been a bit of a knife in the back. But we were messing around, so we can laugh and she can call me a bit of an idiot.”Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsIt’s a raw subject and we’re in a public place, a photographer hovering and snapping. But few New Yorkers turn round and those who do most likely don’t know the man with the espresso won 34 caps for England, went to the 2011 World Cup and won the Premiership with Northampton.There is however a sense Foden’s candour is not entirely the product of his new anonymity. James Kennedy, RUNY’s garrulous Irish owner, is keenly aware that to achieve success in New York’s saturated market he needs characters and stories to sell. In his words, in a notoriously frank city, that means having players who are “open and transparent with the media and say whatever the hell is on their mind”.Evidently Kennedy has found one of those and part of his plan is to use the Englishman as a face of the franchise, an “influencer” in Foden’s words who can build his own brand while building that of the club. RUNY players are encouraged to take public transport, to talk to New Yorkers about the team, MLR and themselves. Laughing, Foden says James Haskell, a notoriously gregarious former England teammate, would have fitted in well.He also laughs about a forthcoming appearance, back in Britain, on a celebrity edition of the reality series SAS Who Dares Wins. To shoot it, in the aftermath of his split from Healy, he “disappeared to Chile for nine days to really put myself through it”. Among those who went through it with him were the Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton, someone from Made in Chelsea and the former Conservative MP Louise Mensch, herself now a New Yorker.In the aftermath of his self-inflicted trial by tabloid, such is Foden’s new reality: one trip into the unknown quickly followed by another, on the rugby field and off it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14e0e7e8104c499756accd7cb1da1f99b1e2c0b2/0_87_2444_1466/master/2444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d1ebf1f609e293a182eb385303e083","title":"do you like boys sorry shannon gabriel reveals joe root sledge","story":"West Indies fast bowler Shannon Gabriel has sought to clear the air over what he said to England captain Joe Root and extended an “unreserved apology” for his comments during the third test against England in St Lucia.Gabriel, 30, had accepted a charge for breaching the International Cricket Council’s code of conduct on Wednesday and was banned for the first four one-day internationals against England that begin on Wednesday.“The exchange occurred during a tense moment on the field,” Gabriel explained in a written statement.“The pressure was on and England’s captain Joe Root was looking at me intensely as I prepared to bowl, which may have been the usual psychological strategy with which all test cricketers are familiar.“I recognise now that I was attempting to break through my own tension when I said to Joe Root: ’Why are you smiling at me?

We elected, foolishly, to watch the film Buried, about an American truck-driver (Ryan Reynolds) in Iraq who spends the film imprisoned in a coffin. The only sliver of hope for this claustrophobic nightmare of a cinema experience would have been a mutual clasp of terror during one of the white-knuckle moments (the snake? the sand? Ryan’s phone running out of battery?). Alas, due to our late arrival at the Gaumont Parnasse, my companion sat not next to me but one row in front. And someone kicked over my popcorn. A dismal failure on every front.During the last Edinburgh fringe, I met a flyerer and we had a fun initial chat. We both had an hour to kill and she asked if I wanted to get a bite to eat. I went “Sure” and she said “OK, do you want to come back to my place?” I was a bit taken aback but it seemed innocent enough so I went along with it. When I got there, she reheated some pasta, we ate and then she started kissing me. She quickly stopped and said: “Sorry, I’m not into this.” So I left and we never spoke again. This all took place within an hour of meeting.We had worked together one summer, and ran into each other one Friday night. We went for drinks and everything was fine, until he shushed me and started listening intensely to the music. It was Madonna or something. Then he smiled and said: “Sorry, it’s just that I communicate with God through music. Carry on.” He told me his powers came from his mother’s cats and that he believed all people were cats or dogs. “You’re obviously a dog,” he said with a big, caring smile. He wanted to win The X Factor. “Do you sing?” I asked. “No,” he said. “But I’ve never cried before and I can only cry if I win The X Factor. I’d love to try crying.” I still don’t know if he was trying to be funny or not. Either way, he never texted me back.Edinburgh festival, 2012. She was flirty and pretty in a girl-next-door way (if the girl next door was really fit). She came to my show, said she loved it and suggested a drink the next night. We had several – laughing, chatting, sharing a fag. The bar was closing but she knew somewhere else. Brilliant! A jazz club. I’ve never been into jazz but I could be tonight. I’ve always been awkward on dates but I was smashing this one. As I walked her home, we shared an umbrella. (Since I was a teenager I’ve thought rain is romantic because of a kissing scene in Ally McBeal I remember thinking: “Imagine wanting to kiss someone so much you didn’t mind your hair getting wet.”) At her house, we gazed into each other’s eyes. Then she broke the silence. “This was amazing. You’re the perfect date. If I was gay, you’d be the one.” Ah … not a date after all.I was 13 and Nick from my drama group invited me to see Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones. Remember it? It’s the one that was extra shit and in which Anakin refers to child jedis as “younglings”. I brought my best friend Libby with me, as was the Year 9 way, and we just took the piss out of the film, not saying a word to poor Nick. Afterwards a friend texted me on my Nokia brick to inform me something I needed to know about Nick. It turns out he wasn’t 13 at all – he was 12. Twelve! I felt lost, betrayed and humiliated. This Year 8 kid had lied to me and it was over. The experience taught me everything I now know about love: ask to see ID before going to the latest Star Wars instalment, or girl you gonna get burned.This date was disastrous thanks to me and only me. While at university, I fancied myself a real manic pixie dream girl – so when a lovely young man asked me out, I decided to inject it with as much whimsy as humanly possible. First, I demanded he drive us to a cemetery, because I wanted to be quirky but in a goth way. It turned out to be much sadder than the Smiths made it seem, so we got back into his car. After that, I asked him to drive us to a strip club. There, he tried his best to maintain eye contact with me as a beautiful woman approached us offering a lap dance. He politely said “I’m good”, to which the beautiful woman responded with a shrug: “I’m better.” Later we made out in his car.Once upon a time, there was a little, ginger, camp comedian who had just finished a Soho theatre run and was ready to find The One. He searched far and wide (OK, I went into Soho after my gig) and met a boy. He looked like Aladdin, we exchanged numbers. Days later, I was invited to his house (a warehouse in east London, and he was vegan – I should have known). The conversation was great, he was a little eccentric and wore a kimono but I just thought: “Take what you can get.” He took me into his “special room” and there was a bed of nails. He said they were for chiropractic – a likely story! I was dying to leave but the Uber surge charge was on. So I hopped on and I’ve not quite been the same since.When I was an awkward 18-year-old, all low self-esteem and Nirvana T-shirts, I met a friend of a friend in the pub. He had dark curly hair and lovely eyes, so when he asked me to go out with him, I was over the moon. I gave him my number (by which I mean the landline at my mum’s house) and steeled myself for a week of sitting by a phone that never rang. But it did. The next day. He was having a party at his house on Saturday night. Would I like to go along as his date? He lived in a village out of town so would come and pick me up. (He had a car! OK, it was his mum’s Nissan Micra, but it was a car!) I was so excited – a date and a house party. We made awkward small talk as he drove me to his parents’ house in the country. I thought: how cool must your parents be to just let you have a party in their massive house? We arrived, and I was greeted at the front door by said parents. Both of them. It was their 25th-anniversary party, where I was to be paraded and introduced to his entire family. I couldn’t escape – I didn’t even know where I was – so I had to smile sweetly and wait for him to drive me home.Never date someone older than your dad. Never date a drug addict. Never date someone you meet in a lift. These were the golden rules my mum told me. I broke all of them two years ago. He told me “You make me feel impossible” and quoted a Stephen King book at me. I assumed it was true love. We arranged to meet at 7pm. He was 45 minutes late. He told me he had been stopping a fight. This turned out to be a lie. He had gone to the cinema on his own to see Paddington and got the timings wrong. He wore Crocs, army shorts and a Robbie Williams Let Me Entertain You tour T-shirt. It was a Friday in December. He resembled a serial killer from Luther.We went to a hipster restaurant where he talked about his brother’s orce, his dead relatives and his acute IBS – all while taking out a lot of aggression on the bread sticks. After he asked if I had “ever considered getting checked for Marfan syndrome”, I stood to make a dignified exit. Instead, I banged my head on a decorative shelf and started bleeding from my head. As I bled all over my dress, the table, the food and my dignity, much like Sissy Spacek in Carrie, I also managed to bleed on his clothes. I apologised. He said there was nothing to apologise for. A week later he sent me a receipt for the dry cleaning.I was 15 and my boyfriend and I were in a posh spa for Valentine’s day. After some heavy petting in the deep end, I needed a widdle and because it was a nice place, I thought I would use the toilet. I sauntered off as sassily as I could in my mum’s ill-fitting Aztec-print bikini, through a door up some stairs. I was following my nose to the toilet because, like a fox (or rat), I work on instinct. I opened a fire door, which locked closed behind me and I took in my surroundings. I was in a five-star restaurant where people were busy eating Sunday lunch. There I was stuck like a fox (or rat) in the headlights: a dripping-wet, apologetic, bikini-clad rat. I did the walk of shame through to the other end of the restaurant, out the front door and back into reception. Hiya!When we first met, my girlfriend was living in Bristol. Early in our relationship, we walked to the beautiful suburb of Clifton for lunch it was all dappled sunlight and gentle breeze. Things were going tremendously well until the end of the meal, when my face and hands began dramatically swelling. My breathing was normal, I was merely beginning to inflate like Violet Beauregarde (but still brown). Once we had acquired deflationary drugs, detective work was in order. It turned out that the multivitamins I had started taking contained small amounts of krill oil. It also turns out that I am allergic to krill. Like a shit whale. If you want a date to go perfectly, avoid spending the preceding week microdosing yourself with poison while telling anyone who’ll listen that you’re “on a health kick”.We were just winding up the date when he broke his arm. My friend had arranged a blind date for me with her work colleague. There had been no spark of romance, I had to foot the whole bill and he told me I looked fatter in real life than on TV. We were just about to part ways (reasonably) amicably at the tube when he decided to vault over the barrier. The tube staff were really kind and sympathetic considering he was a felon, and called an ambulance. They assumed we were boyfriend and girlfriend and I felt obliged to go with him. I stayed with him for five hours in A\u0026ampE until he was discharged. I would love to be a time traveller so I could go back to 2002 and tell my younger self to leave before coffee.When I was 18 I had an all-consuming crush on a boy who was also a very close pal. We were already very comfortable talking about romantic relationships, just never the one we were clearly meant to have. I decided I had to tell him and invited him over to my place. I went to make us some tea and returned with two mugs on a tray. As he took a mug, I said: “I really, really like you.” The mug stopped in mid-air. Wordlessly, eyes glued to the mug, he replaced it on the tray, turned on his heel and walked out the front door. Summer holidays started the next day. I didn’t see him again until we were 24 and he was a last-minute passenger in a car I was driving on a road trip. But that’s another story.Did You Hear About the Morgans? Not a question. That’s the name of the film I saw when I was ditched halfway through a date. I was 18 and on one of my first ever romantic outings. My date (let’s call him Liam … like his parents did) invited me to see it. I was on my best behaviour. I don’t even think we spoke that much but I thought everything was going great. Then the film started … Sarah Jessica Parker attempted a character that wasn’t Carrie Bradshaw and “Liam” (real name) had to go to the bathroom. It was the longest bathroom break ever because it’s still going, apparently.I came of age in the 90s. Back then, you just fell on someone in a nightclub. Dating came later. I joined a dating website a couple of years ago and got chatting to a nice woman. She was quite a bit younger than me but happy to come to my local. When I arrived, she had pushed two armchairs together and had bought not one, but two bottles of wine. I had to be up for the school run. After a few minutes she said: “You snogged my cousin at the Edinburgh festival’ ARGH! Obviously, her cousin did not respect the law of “what happens at the fringe, stays at the fringe”. At Edinburgh, I’m 90s-me again. All other times, I’m a tired fortysomething. There was no second date.I used to watch people go on dates on Sex and the City and think: what are they doing? I didn’t have that sort of life. I used to sleep with people and work backwards: if you can tolerate them in the morning, you might get towards a relationship. I thought dates were like auditions, and I went on those and they were shit. But there was a time when I’d been single for a while so I appealed to a friend to set me up on a blind date. We had a nice evening, he was funny and interesting, but there wasn’t any spark. He was a playwright and was doing a production and offered me a part in it. I ended up snogging one of the other cast members and taking him home with me. He’s now my husband."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d91b8e58e548001a3044d0b651a9b0eea2ff7fa/0_104_4382_2630/master/4382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=315a741db159bce278ea20b01f3d5517","title":"alan partridge bbc brexit steve coogan","story":"Norwich’s finest is back on the BBC. His shambling persona is perfect for our political moment, says Steve CooganLast time Alan Partridge hosted a primetime BBC show, he was sacked live on air for punching his boss in the face with a turkey. Now that the world has “realigned itself along Alan lines”, Norfolk’s most famous radio DJ returns from years in the wilderness with This Time with Alan Partridge.Steve Coogan said it “feels right” for his character to return now, particularly given Brexit: “There might be a missive at the BBC saying that a certain area of the viewing audience had been disenfranchised … Alan potentially represents that. You can imagine them thinking we might as well give this guy another bite of the cherry.”In an act of arch self-satire that rivals its own W1A, the BBC has brought Partridge back to front a live One Show-style magazine programme. Partridge becomes the stand-in presenter after the beloved host falls ill. “He didn’t want to be back at the BBC,” said Coogan, “but when an opportunity presents itself, he had to jump at it.”His creation has morphed over 25 years from “unreconstructed, uber-Conservative little Englander” to a more nuanced figure. “Now he’s a bit more like David Cameron. He’s economically conservative but he understands you’ve got to be socially liberal. He tries to embrace things and tries to be ‘on message’ … but he’s not really.”The humour has moved beyond just mocking people who are intolerant. “It’s funnier to go for people who are attempting to adopt what is known as correct thinking and not quite getting it right.” Today’s woke world is rich pickings for Partridge: “He does try to be in tune with the zeitgeist. You don’t feel like you’re flogging a dead horse because you can adapt him to the times and his attitudes will adapt.”Originally created by Coogan with Armando Iannucci and Patrick Marber for the Radio 4 comedy On the Hour in 1991, Partridge has become one of the most popular comedy characters of all time, with shows including I’m Alan Partridge and Knowing Me, Knowing You. More recently, Coogan has worked with the writers Neil and Rob Gibbons on the film Alpha Papa and spoof memoirs I, Partridge and Nomad, as well as defecting to Sky with shows such as Mid Morning Matters and Scissored Isle.In fact, Partridge is so familiar to fans the production can essentially rest on its laurels. “You can just remove all the comedy and have Alan looking seriously at the camera,” said Neil Gibbons, and be left with nothing more than “the anticipation of what he’s going to do.”The magazine show format lets viewers see Partridge’s rambles during live takes, as well as between-takes shots of his ego being soothed by Lynn, his long-suffering assistant. It also features Partridgean tirades on everything from hand hygiene (leading him to lurk outside the BBC toilets doing spot-checks on colleagues) to hacking.There was one distinct problem of putting him in that setup, though, said Gibbons: “In the early days of Alan, there was a tightrope he was walking because there was an expectation of professionalism. If someone fluffed a line or got someone’s name wrong or said something stupid, it was mortifying. But nowadays, those are the sort of people who are given jobs on TV.”He likened Partridge to presenters such as Piers Morgan. “The producers of Good Morning Britain are not tearing their hair out thinking: ‘I wish he’d stop saying something offensive.’ They’re thinking: ‘That’s why he’s on the show.’ We had to ignore that, because if you put Alan in a world where his crass buffoonery is part of the selling point, there’s nowhere for him to fall.”This Time with Alan Partridge starts on BBC One on 25 February at 9.30pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8781866df9fab27fa46c2eea36d77dc5d54a7efc/0_76_2272_1363/master/2272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26a127abb46b6fbc6ad154f1e0db718c","title":"benedict cumberbatch to play satan in neil gaiman fantasy series good omens","story":"Sherlock star will voice a ‘giant animated Satan’ in the drama, which will also feature David Tennant, Michael Sheen and Frances McDormandBenedict Cumberbatch is set to follow up his role as Brexit architect Dominic Cummings by playing another famously contentious figure. The Sherlock star will appear as Satan in Good Omens, Amazon and the BBC’s adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s fantasy novel, which is due to air in May.Cumberbatch’s involvement was revealed during a Television Critics Association panel for the series, which stars David Tennant and Michael Sheen as a demon and an angel who join forces to save the Earth. The Sherlock star will face off against Frances McDormand, who will play God in the show, while Jon Hamm, Miranda Richardson and Jack Whitehall will also star.Announcing the news, executive producers Gaiman and Douglas Mackinnon, joked that they had found a “young British actor” who required a lot of direction. “He took a lot of work. He was useless at the beginning,” Mackinnon said.“We suddenly realised that we have Satan turning up in episode six, and we needed somebody who could actually give Frances McDormand a run for her money,” Gaiman added.Cumberbatch’s most recent on-screen appearance was as Cummings in Brexit: the Uncivil War, a Channel 4 drama about the strategising behind the Remain and Leave campaigns during the 2016 EU Referendum. In Good Omens the actor, who rose to international prominence with his performance in the BBC’s Sherlock Holmes update, will play what Gaiman described as “a giant, animated Satan” who stands “400 foot high”.A collaboration between Gaiman and Pratchett, who died in 2015, Good Omens was first released in 1990. A film adaptation of the novel was planned in 2002, with Terry Gilliam attached to direct, but never went into production. Gaiman began working on a TV adaptation in 2016 after receiving a posthumous letter from Pratchett urging him to bring the series to the screen.Good Omens debuts on 31 May on Amazon Prime, with all six episodes appearing in one go. The series will then appear on BBC Two later in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58b8693ad68dbeeec6bda011d72e21f2f643f5c8/0_135_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04f8e277082fe9daf81e4deb1184ddfd","title":"alexandria ocasio cortez twitter social media","story":"In eight months, the new congresswoman has built one of DC’s most engaged followings. Here are her best movesWhen it comes to Twitter, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress last November, beats every other US politician hands, nose and elbows down. She has built one of the most engaged followings on Capitol Hill in just eight months and was even appointed to teach social media lessons to her colleagues upon her arrival.How does she do it? I spend my days analyzing data for the  and helping run our social media accounts, so I’m used to digging into numbers and figuring out what gets people going. And more often than not, it’s the less obvious things that reveal what’s really happening.Ocasio-Cortez also has more than 2.1 million followers on Instagram and 500,000 on Facebook, but Twitter is where she really dominates the conversation.She already has more Twitter followers than the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi (2.2 million), and she only just trails Joe Biden (3.3 million). Even when you look at pure, non-weighted engagement, Ocasio-Cortez still punches well above her weight. For example, Trump has 21 times more followers than her. Yet he generated only 2.5 times as many total interactions as she did in January (43.2m compared to 17.5m).All these numbers are useful for understanding the scale of Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter popularity, but do little in terms of explaining it. To further understand why they’ve done so well, here’s a brief timeline of her rapid ascent, and the tweets that have defined it:Ocasio-Cortez introduced herself to many voters with a campaign video in May that ended up going semi-viral. But it was her primary win in June that first gave her a national platform, and this tweet (her biggest in June) set the tone for how she was going to operate.It quickly established that Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t going to let her critics – whether Republicans or Democrats – shape her narrative. Her tweet is a two-part fact-check. But instead of using cold stats like fact-checks usually do, she provides photographic and anecdotal evidence that’s much more personal and emotive.Whether they like it or not, the very fair and balanced people over at Fox News have played a considerable role in Ocasio-Cortez’s success. On top of the all the free airtime they’ve given her, they’ve also provided her with plenty of ammo.The above graphic in particular sparked a running joke that Ocasio-Cortez would use again: is the Fox News graphics department actually on her side?During a recent talk, the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates asked Ocasio-Cortez when she decides to “dunk on fools”. “Whoever is coming at me in my mentions with a blue check when I haven’t eaten in three hours,” she said. “And until more people start pitching in and holding people to account, I’m just going to let them have it.”This was Ocasio-Cortez’s most popular tweet in September and, just like her biggest one in June, she’s setting the record straight.Targeting the far right is always going to be a popular move on Twitter. But it’s her use of “slaying lewks” that douses her already fire tweet with the most flammable thing on the internet: relatability. She speaks the language of her young fans, and they’ve probably never seen anything like it from a politician before.This is what really sets her apart in Congress. Most politicians are elected to represent normal people yet have to hire consultants for advice on how to speak to millennials. Remember when Hillary Clinton told people to “Pokémon Go to the polls”?It should also be noted that September was the month Ocasio-Cortez took her Fox-trolling to new heights:It’s no surprise that, in an age where authenticity matters more than ever, Ocasio-Cortez has done so well. Her story of growing up in a working-class family and bartending a year before she won her primary has become a powerful part of her appeal.It’s not the sole reason she’s popular, but rather acts as a shield around her beliefs. Republicans have tried to dismantle this story as much as possible, and you can see why. After they’ve spent decades trying to paint liberals as out-of-touch elites, it’s one of the biggest threats to their entire narrative.It may not sound like much to anyone who regularly uses emojis, but this is big for a member of Congress. Remember when Hillary asked people to sum up how people felt about student debt in three emojis? And can you imagine someone like Beto O’Rourke or Elizabeth Warren even using the cry-laughing one without it looking weird? (Case in point: Warren attempted to speak internet last month, by asking the account WeRateDogs if her golden retriever was a “1510 official Good Boy”.)There’s no magic to Ocasio-Cortez’s use of our modern-day hieroglyphs, but what’s notable is how you rarely notice them – they never jar or stand out. Like the rest of her language they have a natural flow, and help crystallize her air of authenticity.This tweet was Ocasio-Cortez’s biggest in December. In it, she contrasts her working-class background with her new job in Congress, and taps into people’s huge frustrations with the healthcare system.Intentionally or not, it proves she’s still one of us, and isn’t going to give Congress a free pass now she’s part of it. There’s not much to dislike if you’re a young, leftwing American who values authenticity and a willingness to hold power to account.January was @AOC’s biggest month so far, with the account adding a million new followers. A great deal of this momentum was generated by this one tweet, which got over 160k retweets and 787,000 likes.The video shows her dancing to Edwin Starr’s song War (the one that goes “what is it good for?”). It was a tongue-in-cheek response after she was “outed” for dancing in a spoof music video in college.The original footage was posted by a strange, seemingly rightwing account looking to undermine her. “Here is America’s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is,” read the post. The account was later deleted, raising the hilarious possibility that it was planted by someone on the left who knew it would do wonders for her.Either way, it became the new focal point for the left’s battle with the right over Ocasio-Cortez, and a huge news story.The idea that all Republicans were mocking her for dancing quickly took hold, despite limited examples of them doing so. But the smear did chime with many of the right’s pearl-clutching attacks on her, and the leftwing backlash became part of a wider cry of frustration over her treatment by Republicans.Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet was the climax of the whole ordeal and even by her standards was a surprise. Politicians have danced before Obama was particularly adept at it. But has anyone ever done it in a way that is both entertaining and makes a deft political point?The tweet is really a perfect example of why Ocasio-Cortez has done so well on Twitter. She doesn’t just respond to news or release statements like most politicians – she creates her own content and makes her own news, in an unpredictable and authentic way.And just when you think you’ve seen all the possible fact-checks, clapbacks, and details from her past, she comes out dancing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f870c200f79c4df03c3936fe03cfdc7b260d8/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=967b5f32d95395c8a5a47fda427dac89","title":"gospel glamour how nigerias pastors wield political power","story":"With days to go before the presidential election, four-time candidate Chris Okotie insists he is the man for the top jobby  Ruth Maclean and  Eromo Egbejule in LagosDressed in a white outfit delicately striped with gold and carrying a white tambourine, one of the contenders in Nigeria’s presidential election steps out of a white Rolls-Royce and strides up the aisle of the Household of God, flanked by bodyguards.Chris Okotie, a 1980s pop star turned pentecostal pastor and four-time presidential candidate, is leading the service in the church he founded 32 years ago. For close to five hours his glamorous congregation is kept rapt with a medley of his greatest gospel hits, interspersed with prayer, speaking in tongues and a sesquipedalian sermon on the five foolish virgins. Young women in sweeping sparkly dresses sing along adoringly as ageing Nollywood stars boogie at the back.This year, the two presidential frontrunners are both Muslim – the incumbent, Muhammadu Buhari, and the former vice-president Atiku Abubakar.But the “pentecostalisation” of politics, which began 20 years ago, is continuing unabated, experts say, and the democratic process is shaped by powerful pastors, who regularly weigh in on elections. Some pastors even tell their flocks which way to vote. With no pope or archbishops to tell them what to do or say, and therefore no limit to their political activities, pastors have grown in their ambitions.Though the highest Okotie has ever finished is eighth, he still considers himself and his Fresh party to be the solution to Nigeria’s problems. He has offered himself to the two leading candidates as a president everyone can agree on – what he calls a “consensus remedial facilitator” – in an interim government, though the chance they will go for it is slimmer than a communion wafer.Traditionally, the highest office of the vast west African country has alternated between Muslims and Christians. Though northern Muslims have had only a slight advantage, being in office for about 33 of the 58 years since independence, most Nigerians think they have dominated, and Nigeria’s pentecostals are increasingly competing with them for state power.Many Nigerian Christians fear the “Islamisation” of their country, pointing to the rise of Boko Haram in the north-east over the past decade, the spread of Sharia law across many northern states in the early 2000s, and attacks by mostly Muslim herders, who are often unfairly perceived as waging a jihadist campaign against Christian farmers. At least three priests have been killed in as many years in the pastoralist crisis in the Middle Belt, and the perceived nonchalance of the presidency about the issue has turned many Christians against the government.Going into this Saturday’s election, many Christian Nigerians see Atiku, as Abubakar is popularly known, as more liberal than Buhari – and therefore more friendly to them, and more likely to deal with these threats.Buhari, however, has on his side Yemi Osinbajo, the vice-president and a pastor from the Redeemed Christian Church of God, which has over 20,000 branches in 198 countries as well as its millions of Nigerian adherents.In picking Osinbajo, Buhari was continuing to recognise the major political clout of pentecostal Christianity in his country, which is home to some of the world’s biggest megachurches. In 2011 he chose the influential Tunde Bakare of the Latter Rain Assembly, who gives his sermons titles like The Technology of Wealth Transfer and The Termites of Destiny.Osinbajo and his faithful flock may have been a deciding factor in their 2015 victory, despite the fact that David Oyedepo, the founder of Winners’ Chapel, who preaches a prosperity gospel and has described himself as “dangerously wealthy”, told his congregation to pray for his opponent, the incumbent Goodluck Jonathan, to win.On Sunday 16 February, 84m voters will choose who leads Africa’s largest democracy. Despite over 60 candidates, it is likely to be a choice between President Muhammadu Buhari, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar.Buhari\u0027s 2015 victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party was built on three promises: to rid Nigeria of endemic corruption, fix the economy and tackle security threats.The government says it is making progress in the fight against Boko Haram, but it is now in its tenth year, and the economy entered and climbed out of recession under Buhari. Opponents say his government is failing to tackle corruption, while Amnesty International say the army has been responsible for human rights abuses.After spending five months in Britain in 2017 receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment, opposition groups said he was unfit for office, but Buhari, 76, says he is strong enough to serve.Main opposition People\u0027s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate Atiku, 72, has been caught up in corruption allegations since serving as vice president from 1999-2007. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\u0026nbsp He has promised business-friendly policies to double the economy to $900bn by 2025. He wants to privatise parts of the state oil company, and create a $25bn fund to support private sector investment.Atiku\u0027s opponents have claimed he would exploit those pro-business policies to enrich himself and those around him.Nigeria is deeply ided between the mainly Muslim north and largely Christian south. There are more than 200 distinct ethnic groups. This has led to an unofficial power-sharing agreement, with the presidency alternating between north and south every eight years.It isn\u0027t just religion or ethnicity causing fractures. Half of Nigeria’s registered voters are aged 18-35. Many say their ageing leaders are out of touch, and supported a Not Too Young to Run campaign to encourage younger people seeking office.2015 was the only time Nigeria had a peaceful power handover since civilian government took over in 1999. Even then there was evidence of vote buying, voter intimidation, and other forms of corruption. International observers fear election interference and rigging this time around.Last month, Buhari triggered a constitutional row when he suspended the chief judge, who has a crucial say in resolving election result disputes.The candidate with the most votes is declared winner, as long as they have at least one-quarter of the vote in two-thirds of Nigeria\u0027s 36 states and the capital. Otherwise there is a run-off.Ebenezer Obadare, professor and author of the new book Pentecostal Republic, said that the “old story” of the interaction between religion and democracy had changed with the rise of the pentecostal churches.Pentecostal churches are forcing Muslim leaders to up their game to keep their hold on power, Obadare said. God is invoked on everyone’s side.The pentecostal church has been growing as part of a wave of religious fervour rising in Nigeria since the early 1990s. As the standard of living fell through both military and civilian administrations, citizens clung to their faith for salvation and respite. Pentecostals multiplied in the south, giving purpose and the promise of miracles to their converts.Whoever is in power, working together – what Obadare calls an “inter-religious political bromance” – is crucial. In the 2015 presidential election, Jonathan’s national security adviser spent billions of naira employing marabouts – Muslim holy men – from Saudi Arabia and north Africa to pray for his re-election, according to Nigerian media. Marabouts have enjoyed special access to the presidency since the 1980s.In an interview in his marble antechamber after the service, Okotie delivers his analysis in the same style as his sermons.“The things that ide us are ethnicity and religion, so we must rise above the pastiches of religion, the mosaic of ethnicity and whatever it is that separates us to an altitude where these cleavages diminish into mere superficial lacerations in the terrain of national integration and that’s the message that I’ve been given and that we can translate the paraphernalia of our ersity into the apparatus of national unity because we have an aboriginal connectivity that cannot be vitiated by politics, religion or ethnicity and we need to realise that and if we can embrace this philosophy then there’s hope,” he says, hardly pausing for breath.

It is too small to appear on the world stage on its own.”Rutte, who also claimed the Dutch would replace the UK in the bloc as the pre-eminent voice for free trade, has been regularly consulted by Theresa May on progress in the Brexit negotiations.The Netherlands is one of the EU member states that will be most affected by the barriers to trade that will emerge after the UK leaves the bloc, although it has been the beneficiary of some relocations by big businesses.Figures released last week by the Dutch investment agency revealed 42 companies had relocated to the Netherlands in 2018, citing Brexit as a reason, resulting in the movement of 1,923 jobs.Asked whether a Brexit deal was likely, Rutte said in an interview with European media outlets, including the Spanish newspaper El País: “My impression is that the ball is heading towards the precipice and everyone screams to stop, but nobody does anything to stop it, at least, from the British side.”He said of the Irish backstop, which has proven to be the most contentious of issues, that Brussels had no intention of trying to use it to trap Britain in a customs union with the EU.The backstop, under which Northern Ireland would stay in the single market and the whole of the UK would share a customs territory, is to come into force should a future trade deal or alternative arrangement be unable to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland.Rutte said: “Some British parliamentarians say that we want to trap them in a permanent limbo. But it is not true. The EU is interested in moving to the next phase as soon as possible and starting a new relationship with the United Kingdom.“But given May’s efforts to renegotiate the Irish safeguard, I do not know how this will end and if we can avoid a hard Brexit. It would be devastating for the UK.”Rutte was speaking after a speech in Zurich on Wednesday, in which he highlighted that the “chaos” of Brexit showed “there’s no such thing as splendid isolation”.UK MPs will debate the next steps in the Brexit talks later on Thursday. Theresa May has asked the Commons to approve a motion that “reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this house on 29 January”.Tory MPs in the Eurosceptic European Research Group, chaired by Jacob Rees-Mogg, are threatening to rebel as the Commons had expressed both its support for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop and for no deal to be avoided.It has been reported that up to 50 Tory MPs could abstain or vote against the motion, delivering another defeat for the prime minister. A Labour amendment is also seeking to force the government to return to parliament by the end of the month to hold a vote on its Brexit plan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125796cf8e9bd61255b7ad5a7c7f7706bd65725f/20_27_3404_2042/master/3404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=610cbc53068dc3881a38eee571f47a03","title":"german economy just avoids recession but weaker exports take toll","story":"Europe’s largest economy recorded zero growth in the fourth quarter of 2018Germany narrowly avoided falling into recession in the second half of last year as weaker exports dragged Europe’s largest economy to stalling point during the final three months of 2018.Several economists had previously warned that Germany was on the brink of recession because of consecutive monthly declines in factory output, with the country suffering from weaker levels of global demand and disruption at factories.Tensions between the US and China have acted as a handbrake on global goods trade, while growth is slowing in the Chinese economy after years of rapid expansion. Sales of cars in China dropped last year for the first time in almost 30 years, affecting manufacturers across Europe.New vehicle emissions tests introduced after the VW emissions scandal have also caused disruption to factories across Europe, including in Britain. Manufacturing accounts for about a fifth of the Germany economy, about double the size of Britain’s industrial base.Analysts said that domestic demand in the German economy – predominantly from investment in construction and machinery as well as government spending – helped it to avoid recession.Growth in consumer spending was, however, subdued, while net exports were a severe drag on headline GDP growth.Andrew Kenningham, the chief Europe economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said there were some reasons to hope German GDP growth would recover at the start of 2019.“There may be a further pick-up in auto production as the emissions testing backlog is cleared and household real incomes should rise due to falling headline inflation,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5e97115f6d63148be2a348d99fea0640c842c20/158_0_2725_1635/master/2725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29d1073f15d763e4468880223bf74394","title":"italy rejects record number of asylum applications","story":"Hardline policies from Italy’s rightwing government having devastating effect on migrantsItaly has rejected a record 24,800 asylum applications in the last four months, and aid groups say hardline policies introduced by the rightwing populist government are beginning to have a devastating effect on migrants in the country.The decree suspends the asylum application process for iniduals considered to be “socially dangerous” and also removes permission to remain for some of those denied formal refugee status but who are unable to return home. More than 7,000 people have been refused so-called “humanitarian protection” since October. There were just 150 approvals in January, down from 2,091 in January 2018, leading to a sharp increase in the number of migrants with no legal status.The data was released by the Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), a thinktank, based on analysis of figures from the interior ministry. It found a year-on-year rise in rejected asylum applications from 17,500 between October 2017 and January 2018 to close to 25,000 between October 2018 and January 2019.Asylum rejections from June 2018, when the coalition of the Five Star Movement and the League came to power, to September 2018 totalled 19,460, ISPI said.“The decree will keep increasing the number of illegal immigrants in Italy,” Matteo Villa, a research fellow for the ISPI’s migration programme, told the .“According to our estimates, there could be more than 670,000 asylum seekers who will find themselves living irregularly in Italy, partly because the government does not have the capacity to deport them.’’The majority of the people whose asylum requests were denied in recent months arrived in Italy in 2017. It can take an average of 19 months for Italian authorities to respond to an asylum application. The Italian government has promised to repatriate 500,000 people. To date it has repatriated about 500 migrants per month – fewer than the average of the previous government.“We calculated it would take almost a century to repatriate all the migrants denied asylum,” Villa said.Meanwhile, expulsions of migrants denied humanitarian protection have continued from reception centres around Italy. Many of those expelled are likely to become homeless.In January more than 500 people were ousted from a refugee reception centre in Castelnuovo di Porto, a town close to Rome, in the first major eviction since the Salvini decree was brought into law.A further 50 were expelled last week from the Cara di Mineo reception centre in Sicily, one of the largest in Europe.Charities said a Nigerian man who killed himself this month had recently been denied a residence permit. Prince Jerry, 25, a chemistry graduate, was continuing his studies at university having arrived from Libya on a boat two and a half years ago.In mid-January his appeal to stay in the country was rejected and he “fell into a deep depression”, according to sources close to Jerry. He had been staying in Tortona in Piedmont at the time of his death.Father Alex Zanotelli, a member of the Comboni missionaries in Verona, described Jerry’s death as “a state murder, the bitter fruit of the Salvini decree, which besides insecurity produces deaths”.• In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

He was reportedly en route to see a Swedish specialist over fears he had the neurological disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.Angela Gui, who is a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, has been vocal about calling for her father’s release.In the Medium post, Gui details the “very strange experience”, alleging that she was contacted by Anna Lindstedt, Sweden’s ambassador to China, in mid-January and invited to Stockholm to hear about a “new approach” to her father’s case.Lindstedt returned to Stockholm on Wednesday to meet officials from the foreign affairs ministry, the Swedish embassy in Beijing told Associated Press by phone. Lindstedt is not under criminal investigation. The embassy declined to give further details, but a foreign ministry spokesman in Sweden confirmed that Lindstedt’s departure was related to meetings she arranged between Gui and the Chinese businessmen.“She didn’t explain very much, but said that there were some businessmen she thought could help, and that they wanted to meet me in Stockholm. She’d join too, and these were people she trusted, she reassured me,” wrote Gui.Gui said the meetings were held at a hotel lounge, which required keycard access. She was encouraged not to leave the suite, with the businessmen saying they needed her to “be around as much as possible”. She said she was even escorted to and from the bathroom.After several days, during which time Gui says she was offered a job at the Chinese embassy, Gui said she felt a growing sense of unease.“There was a lot of wine, a lot of people, and a lot of increasingly strange questions. But because Ambassador Lindstedt was present and seemingly supportive of whatever it was that was going on, I kept assuming that this had been initiated by the Swedish foreign ministry,” wrote Gui.She alleges the men told her that talks were underway with Beijing to secure her father’s release but that in order for them to succeed Gui must stop talking about the case and avoid media engagement because “‘the Chinese’ were very angry with me”.Gui says Lindstedt agreed to the plan and promised that if Gui’s father was released she would “go on Swedish television and speak of the bright future of Sweden-China relations”.Gui claims that the conversations took a nasty turn, with one man saying she had to trust him or she would never see her father again and that her refusal to cooperate could harm the ambassador’s career.“Ambassador Lindstedt added that China were adopting a new diplomatic line which meant that if activism and media coverage was to continue, China might ‘punish Sweden’,” wrote Gui.Gui said she rang the ministry of foreign affairs the following week and they told her they were unaware that these meetings had taken place and were not even aware Lindstedt was in the country.A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Stockholm denied any involvement in the incident. “The embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Sweden would like to solemnly state that the Chinese side has never authorised and will not authorise anyone to engage with Gui Minhai’s daughter,” the spokesperson said. “China is a country of rule of law, and the result of the Gui Minhai case is to be decided by China’s law, instead of the so-called China’s representative claimed by Gui Minhai’s daughter or the press. We hope that some people will not try to gain publicity for themselves by making up a so-called China’s representative.”Gui concluded her post by saying she would continue to campaign for her father’s release: “I’m not going to be quiet in exchange for a visa and an arbitrary promise that my father ‘might’ be released. Threats, verbal abuse, bribes, or flattery won’t change that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e9de6d4135f58f2d76fce16d69311effe4cc669/0_126_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b60e9730617ddfb22c5a0773d4a9906","title":"us and israel say confrontation with iran needed for peace","story":"Israeli PM deletes tweet that said he was at Warsaw summit to discuss ‘war with Iran’EU fears that a US and Polish-led summit on the Middle East is designed largely to build an alliance against Iran appear to have been confirmed, when the Israeli prime minister and the US secretary of state said a confrontation with Iran was necessary to achieve peace in the region.Mike Pompeo, the US’s top diplomat, did not single out Iran in his formal opening statement, but in separate remarks to reporters said: “You can’t achieve stability in the Middle East without confronting Iran. It’s just not possible.“There are malign influences in Lebanon, Yemen, Syria and Iraq,” he added, referring to Iran-supported groups. “The three H’s: the Houthis, Hamas and Hezbollah – these are real threats.”The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had earlier withdrawn a claim on his Twitter account, said to be the product of a mistranslation, that he was in Warsaw to discuss “war with Iran”.EU countries – France, Germany and the UK – have stuck by a nuclear deal signed with Iran in 2015, but Donald Trump last year pulled out, imposing sweeping economic sanctions, including a ban on the purchase of Iran’s oil exports. The main European powers have either sent low-level delegations or remained at the summit briefly, fearing US motivations for the meeting.By contrast, the US is represented in Warsaw by Pompeo, the vice-president, Mike Pence, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and special aide on the Middle East. It is expected Kushner will discuss his peace plan with Arab leaders in private as well as at a public session on the sidelines of the summit with the former Norwegian foreign minister Børge Brende.Netanyahu has described the opening dinner at which he sat alongside senior officials from Arab Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, as a “historical turning point”. Many Arab states do not recognise Israel, and have not shared a diplomatic stage with the country since a Middle East peace conference in Madrid in 1991, but they have been driven together in a common fear of Iran.It remains to be seen how far the new alliance can extend to a combined approach to the Palestinian issue. Netanyahu has also argued that the Arab world is open to normalised economic ties with Israel that are not dependent on a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.At the opening session, he sat next to Khaled Alyemany, the foreign minister of Yemen, and the two exchanged a brief smile. Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s Middle East envoy, said on Twitter that Alyemany offered his microphone to Netanyahu, whose own had broken. Netanyahu then joked it signalled a “new cooperation between Israel and Yemen”, Greenblatt said. Palestinian officials have condemned the summit.Netanyahu, facing elections shortly, told reporters in Warsaw: “In a room of some 60 foreign ministers representative of dozens of governments, an Israeli prime minister and the foreign ministers of the leading Arab countries stood together and spoke with unusual force, clarity and unity against the common threat of the Iranian regime.“I think this marks a change and important understanding of what threatens our future, what we need to do to secure it, and the possibility that cooperation will extend beyond security in every realm of life.”Officials said that Netanyahu spoke around the same table as senior officials of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, none of which have relations with Israel. Israel only has diplomatic relations with two Arab states, neighbouring Egypt and Jordan.Netanyahu also met one-on-one in Warsaw with Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, the foreign minister of Oman, where he travelled late last year.In his opening speech, Pompeo did not mention Iran by name, but called for a new era of co-operation in the Middle East, adding “no country could afford to stay on the sidelines”.The call will be met sceptically by EU leaders who feel they were not consulted on the US decision to pull out of the Iran deal, or the planned withdrawal of 2,000 US troops from Syria.The Iranian foreign minister, Javed Zarif, described the Warsaw conference as “dead on arrival”, and another attempt by the US to pursue an unfounded obsession with Iran.A former US ambassador to Sweden, Azita Raji, also dismissed the event saying “conducting a lacklustre and rambling conference on the Middle East shows that it is amateur hour at the White House and is ultimately another blow to US prestige and leadership”.The Warsaw conference came as the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, increasingly seen as a key player in the Middle East, hosted his Iranian and Turkish counterparts to discuss a final settlement in the Syrian civil war, including the presence of a large number of Islamist fighters in Idlib province.The three countries – especially Turkey and Iran – do not agree on the final settlement in Syria, but have been uneasily co-operating to find a solution that does not betray their interests.Iran wants Turkey to agree that Syrian forces should be deployed along the border with Turkey, but there has also been a separate US discussion of an international force to assuage Kurdish fears of Turkish invasion of Kurdish areas once US forces depart.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Wednesday that the leaders would also discuss forming a special committee tasked with drawing up a new postwar constitution for Syria. The composition of this committee, including the role of civil society has been in dispute for more than a year. The previous UN special envoy, Staffan de Mistura, admitted on his retirement in December he had not overcome mainly Syrian government objections to his vision for the committee’s membership."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Lord Mayor of Dublin Nial Ring met mortgage debt demands on Clontarf houseIncident happened at about 10am between the Cookstown and Tallaght Hospital stopsStephen O\u0026rsquoConnor died after incident outside fast food outlet in Killorglin last SundayGarda\u0026iacute seize eight cars a day driven by unaccompanied learner driversAndrew Doan is accused of murdering Charles John McCarthy in Australia in 2017Minister insists huge progress made in recent years in provision of social homesRobbie Walsh had pleaded not guilty to murder of Karl Haugh (25) in August 2017Six-wheeled vehicle Opportunity was built to operate for just three monthsMan who was in the house not injured but considerable damage caused to sitting roomInterim committee would focus on whiplash and other soft-tissue injuriesEfforts to counter the threat have fuelled much experimentation and investigationArchitectural historian and astrophysicist pick up top academic accoladesBoard gave contracts to family members in breach of rules, says State watchdogResearch Lives: Dr Anthony Ventresque, Lero, researcher and director of the UCD Complex Software LabDepartment of Education issues warning to secondary teachers\u0026rsquo unionsStudy shows male students with lower Leaving Cert points more likely to drop outHSE took Eamon Murphy to court over confusingly similar \u0026lsquoMy Options\u0026rsquo service"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3792877.1550093716!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda%C3%AD seize eight cars a day driven by unaccompanied learner drivers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMotorists whose vehicles have been seized face court fines of up to €1,000 and release fees of €125 for the first day, and €35 for each additional day. File photograph: Bryan O’Brien Gardaí seized 377 vehicles driven by unaccompanied learner drivers in the first 50 days of new legislation, according to the latest statistics.From December 22nd until February 10th gardaí seized almost eight cars per day on average, from learner drivers who failed to obey the regulation requiring them to be accompanied by a driver who has held a licence for at least two years.While it was already an offence carrying up to four penalty points and a fine of €120 for learners to drive unaccompanied, last December gardaí acquired new powers known as the Clancy Amendment, which allow them to impound the vehicles of learner drivers caught breaking the rule.Motorists whose vehicles have been seized face court fines of up to €1,000 and release fees of €125 for the first day, and €35 for each additional day or part day.Where the vehicle’s owner claims the vehicle was taken by the unaccompanied driver without permission, the gardaí may institute an additional prosecution for theft against the learner.The amendment is named after mother and daughter Geraldine and Louise Clancy who were killed on December 22nd, 2015, when an unaccompanied learner driver lost control of her car in Co Cork.The Clancy family campaigned for the amendment and in recent weeks Noel Clancy, father of Louise and husband of Geraldine, has appeared on a new road-safety campaign describing how his wife and daughter were killed and how he misses them.Among the first of the vehicles to be seized under the Clancy amendment was a car which was stopped on the M8 southbound, near Fermoy, by the local roads policing unit, according to the Garda. The driver had been detected speeding, and it was discovered he was an unaccompanied learner driver.The level of vehicle seizures was described as “disappointing” but evidence of the need for the legislation, by a spokesman for the Road Safety Authority.‘A disgrace’However Kerry TD Michael Healy Rae described the numbers as “a disgrace”.Mr Healy Rae said young people were being criminalised because of the legislation and were not driving to flout the law, but because they had no other option to get to college or work. He said “politicians inside in the Dáil who voted to ban this told me privately that this is how they learned to drive themselves, it is the ultimate disgrace”.Garda sources said there appeared to be some overlap between offences with those who were not compliant with the Clancy amendment frequently being responsible for further infringements.In one such case, a youth stopped driving in south Dublin had no licence, tax or insurance and told gardaí he had bought the car for €90.One incident found a motorist who was stopped because of a faulty rear light was in fact an unaccompanied learner driver who had taken off the car’s L-plates before driving.In another case, an unaccompanied learner driver failed a roadside breath test and was found to be over the legal alcohol limit.A learner motorist was detected in Co Kildare travelling at 115kmhr in a 50kmhr zone, while driving unaccompanied."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3793711.1550141018!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bertie ahern asked how ireland feels about re joining the uk","story":"During questions in an Exiting the European Union Committee in London, former taoiseach Bertie Ahern said that Northern  Ireland is not the same as other parts of the UK.

One is that the Republic should just leave the European Union and that would solve all the problems and one which I believe is the subject of a petition to this parliament is that the Republic should re-join the United Kingdom and that would solve all the problems. What’s your impressions of how these various suggestions have been received by the people of Ireland?Mr Ahern responded: “Well I’ll just be kind and say not very well”.“Unfortunately we have an 800-year past of difficulties and that’s just a reality of our history.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

We now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. File photograph: Sebastian WillnowAFPGetty ImagesWhen you imagine a Neanderthal you probably think of the classic image of the “cave man”: heavy brow, monkey-like face, stooping posture, shaggy hair, holding a big club. Although this is not how most scientists imagine Neanderthals today (have a look at http:www.nhm.ac.ukdiscoverwho-were-the-neanderthals.html), the early images were based on observed characteristics of Neanderthal skeletal remains. An Irish-based scientist, the geologist William King, had an important role in interpreting these remains and even provided the name Homo neanderthalensis to express his belief that they were the remains of a new species of hominid similar to, but distinct from, modern humans.The position of Neanderthals in the ancestral tree of Homo sapiens has been a subject of debate since the first skull was discovered in Germany in 1856. Since then, fragments of more than 500 iniduals have been discovered. Scientists have asked questions about Neanderthal language and cognition, about Neanderthal tools, about Neanderthal burial practices and beliefs. Perhaps the most furious debate has concerned their relationship to fully modern humans. After the Neanderthal genome was sequenced in 2010, the debate has focused on how much interbreeding occurred between communities of Neanderthals and of Homo sapiens in Europe. In short, what percentage of our DNA did we get from Neanderthals? Before genome sequencing, scientists could only use their knowledge of comparative anatomy to determine the relationship between fossilised remains and living organisms. Using a cast of a skull cap and the descriptions of other Neanderthal skeletal remains written by other scientists, King asserted that the remains found in the Neander valley were different enough from modern humans to form a new species.King, originally from Sunderland, had been appointed a professor of geology at one of the newly opened Queen’s Colleges in 1849. The controversial “non-denominational” colleges were the precursors of NUI Galway, University College Cork and Queen’s University Belfast and aimed to increase the opportunities for Ireland’s middle classes to access higher education. The colleges were particularly forward thinking in their focus on scientific instruction. Isolated in Galway with few students but with a good laboratory and access to the ever-increasing scientific periodical press, King ranged widely across many sciences we might now consider separate. Most geologists today would think twice about debating the comparative anatomy of modern humans, chimpanzees and ancient remains. Yet when King obtained a cast of the unusual German skull cap, he compared it with a variety of other skulls (using both a collection of objects and descriptions in scientific papers) and concluded that the skull was so different from modern humans as to constitute a new species. Before King’s contribution, the predominant view was that the Neanderthal might be a deformed or diseased human. King dismissed this idea with the suggestion that even the most degraded and “inferior” human races (as King believed races other than Europeans to be) showed a more spherical skull and a higher forehead than the Neanderthal skull cap suggested. During the 19th century, a high forehead was believed to indicate superior intelligence. Australian Aborigines were most Europeans’ favourite example of a supposedly “degraded” and “savage” race and King believed that even their skulls showed more similarity to modern humans than the Neanderthal skull. In short, the Neanderthal skull’s “strong simial tendencies” led King to believe that it was simply too different from humans to be of the same species. In his 1864 paper for the Quarterly Journal of Science he even proposed in a foonote that “I now feel strongly inclined to believe that it is not only specifically but generically distinct from Man”. That is, not a member of the genus Homo. It is hard for us to recapture the shock value of King’s ideas in asserting the existence of another species of human-like creatures at a time when the Biblical version of creation was widely considered an accurate description of the Earth’s history.Things have come almost full circle from King’s time: we now know that Neanderthals are our closest ancestor and probably interbred with humans. Yet what has remained curiously consistent is our belief that Neanderthals were inferior to modern humans, although the explanations have changed. Rather than the absence of a high forehead, scientists now refer to the absence of some kind of genetic adaptation that enabled Homo sapiens to create more advanced societies and out-compete their shorter, stockier neighbours.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3792834.1550083910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"when it comes to 2020 don t count out the moderate democrats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Kamala Harris    –  already living down her past as a prosecuting attorney. Photograph: Win McNameeGetty At some point, any able-bodied Democrat who does not run for US president will have searching questions to answer about their self-esteem.Declared and probable candidates for 2020 are well into the double figures. Senator Kamala Harris has even reached the excruciatingly titled memoir-manifesto stage, with The Truths We Hold and, for lucky children, Superheroes are Everywhere.Surveying this erse, jostling field, many commentators say the party’s future is left wing. Radicalised in opposition to president Donald Trump, activists are demanding universal healthcare\u0026nbspthe abolition of current immigration enforcement and\u0026nbspthrough a Green New Deal, the rapid decarbonisation of the US economy.The centre is clean out of morale and, after Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016,\u0026nbspelectoral credibility, too. When Trump decried “socialism” in his State of the Union address, he was inadvertently flattering the left’s current momentum.Trump has made some Democrats ravenous for an equal and opposite reaction to him. But he has made many more just itch to defeat him, whatever the means. A Monmouth University survey has found that 56 per cent of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents favour an electable candidate over an ideologically sympathetic one. Just 33 per cent prefer the inverse. The gap is even larger among women. Polling director Patrick Murray says this preference is untypical in primary races within either party.If this win-at-all-costs discipline seems easy to promise\u0026nbspand harder to practise, remember that it has already been tested. In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats could have promised Trump’s impeachment or a battery of green taxes or kinder treatment of immigrants. Instead, they hardly strayed from a narrow, exhaustively poll-tested message about healthcare. The result was a handsome victory.What if the party really were as radical as the hype around a few of its congressional newcomers suggests? A moderate would still have grounds for hope.A candidate who runs as a progressive faces a gauntlet of purity tests. It is the nature of purity that no actual human possesses it. Candidates end up debasing themselves in a futile quest to establish their political pristineness. Harris is already living down her past as a prosecuting attorney, which some liberals cite as proof of latent authoritarianism. Another senator, Elizabeth Warren, has apologised for once registering as “American Indian”, lest anyone think a white-looking woman was claiming victimhood. A third, Kirsten Gillibrand, is accused of coming to the left conveniently late.Even to recite these stories is to feel sorry for the candidates. But it was their choice to pitch to the left, whose tendency to eat its own has never been a tightly guarded secret.A moderate can hope to evade these tests altogether. By never claiming to be all that radical in the first place, any pragmatic compromises on their record are unworthy of censure, or even comment. Klobuchar is some way to the left of a 1990s New Democrat. But it is well known that she gets on with Republicans and only goes so far on universal healthcare.Such accommodations with reality are the point of her candidacy, not a stain to be explained away. Activists may still balk, but they cannot put her through the kind of ideological invigilation that leaves the subject looking shifty, hypocritical and pandering. Dissenting from the base confers a perverse kind of staying power.The Democrats’ leftward turn is a story that has outstripped the available evidence. Some of it is wishful Republican thinking. Some of it is the media’s enchantment with novelty. But just three months ago, the Democrats won suburban votes by the bushel with a risk-averse, even drab campaign. The lesson is not entirely lost on the party. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"exorcisms thelutheran intercessors nigeria pictures","story":"Brexit latest news: Theresa May risks fresh Brexit humiliation as Tory Brexiteers threaten revolt over Government motion   Prince Harry says rugby changes lives during Q\u0026ampA with England Rugby union co-captain Dylan HartleyGovernments urged to stockpile antibiotics for a future flu pandemic Gay couples in Japan join together on Valentine\u0026#39s Day to sue government over same-sex marriage banDispatch: Inside Syria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Camp of Death\u0026#39 where British mothers and children struggle to survive in legal limboFather of Isil bride says the girls are \u0026#39no threat\u0026#39 to Britain as he pleads with Government to allow them to returnA\u0026ampE performance hits all time low Duke of Edinburgh to face no further action over Sandringham crash after CPS decides against prosecutingBrexit latest odds: Best bets on how (and if) Brexit will happenBrexit vote: What are MPs voting on today, and how will it affect the deal?Isil schoolgirl Shamima Begum \u0026#39will not be rescued\u0026#39, as Security Minister warns \u0026#39actions have consequences\u0026#39Comment: To fix the backstop, Theresa May should push on with the Malthouse CompromiseValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Who was St Valentine and what is the true meaning behind February 14?Senior Philippine journalist arrested amid fears of crackdown on press freedomExeter murders: Neighbours report seeing \u0026#39scruffy looking man with a toolbag\u0026#39 outside victims\u0026#39 homeBoris Johnson: John McDonnell should be \u0026#39utterly ashamed\u0026#39 of calling Winston Churchill a \u0026#39villain\u0026#39British schoolgirl Shamima Begum who joined Isil found in Syria and \u0026#39wants to come home\u0026#39Singer Ryan Adams hits back over claims of sexual misconductWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?Brexit and the Irish border explained: why the headache is not going away any time soonWhy extending Article 50 looks inevitable - and the consequences of delaying BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/opinion/2019/02/06/TELEMMGLPICT000187047511_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQDfO_Li8BnuRdRCVfSGXuQvhzdjcZien2ya59CfVOfk.jpeg?imwidth=","title":"social media companies want force good responsibility must become","story":"Like them or loathe them, social media companies have transformed the world in which we liveBanner: Duty of CareLike them or loathe them, social media companies have transformed the world in which we live. From finding love to toppling corrupt governments, this multi-billion dollar industry – with sharing as its organising principle – can be a force for good.As a former science and innovation minister, I know we are only at the start of this technological revolution. And I want Britain to be the go‑to place in Europe where digital platforms – including social media and messaging behemoths like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Tinder – can flourish.But that also means recognising that this great leap forward in connecting people can cause harm, to iniduals and society at large. The argument that the web should be beyond careful regulation is long past its sell by date. Social media giants have come of age and are making vast profits. Now they must take on the big responsibilities we expect of all big companies.To lead the world, therefore, Britain must set a new standard for these firms: to enhance their reputation and sustain their business models for the long term, by protecting their users.The time to act is now. A growing body of research has linked social media use to a range of mental health problems, from depression and anxiety to eating disorders and sleep problems. As the generation that use social media the most, it is those aged 16 to 24 that are being hardest hit.Duty of care puffA report by the Royal Society for Public Health suggested that social media can be more addictive than alcohol or cigarettes. Cyber‑bullying and grooming are rife on some platforms. The tragic suicide of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who was exposed to distressing material about depression and suicide on Instagram, brings home the dark side of social media. Systems designed to bring people together are leaving many young people feeling isolated, alone and alienated.The harmful effects extend beyond this, however. From extremism and intellectual property scams to subverting our democratic processes, the power of social media can all too easily be perverted.So we need a new approach that all social media sites will adopt – we need something that will go viral, so to speak. As the use of social media is increasingly universal, any solutions have to be systemic – and taken seriously by all the players in the industry. This is why I am backing the Daily ’s duty of care campaign.Put simply, social media giants should have a statutory duty of care to their users, obliging them to take more responsibility for reasonably foreseeable damage caused to iniduals and the public through use of their platforms. The idea of a duty of care set out in statute is not new. For decades, companies have had a duty of care to their employees as well as employers. As Professor Lorna Woods and William Perrin point out, there is no reason why a similar system cannot be evolved for the tech industry.Real and fast progress is vital. But this will only be achieved if the tech giants take the lead in working with a willing government to design this new statutory regime. The attention paid to this issue by this newspaper and the dignified campaign of Molly Russell’s parents have forced Instagram to welcome the idea of a duty of care. That is a good start, but it will take more than words to mitigate the harmful effects of social media.Duty of Care campaign | Read moreEffective leadership involves tech giants rethinking the design of their services in a safety-conscious way. Just as passenger, public and environmental safety is critical to the car manufacturing industry, social media platforms need to see prevention of harm as core to their business. We, rightly, expect more from business, with the demands on them to operate responsibly – wherever they are – increasingly daily.Tech giants spend serious money understanding their users. Investing in tools to limit the anxiety, insecurity and depression their services can foster (for example) should be part of their license to operate.If social media companies want to be a force for good, they must share the responsibility and lead the way in dealing with the bad. This should be their covenant with their customers.Duty of Care CampaignBrexit latest news: Theresa May risks fresh Brexit humiliation as Tory Brexiteers threaten revolt over Government motion   Prince Harry says rugby changes lives during Q\u0026ampA with England Rugby union co-captain Dylan HartleyGovernments urged to stockpile antibiotics for a future flu pandemic Gay couples in Japan join together on Valentine\u0026#39s Day to sue government over same-sex marriage banDispatch: Inside Syria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Camp of Death\u0026#39 where British mothers and children struggle to survive in legal limboFather of Isil bride says the girls are \u0026#39no threat\u0026#39 to Britain as he pleads with Government to allow them to returnA\u0026ampE performance hits all time low Duke of Edinburgh to face no further action over Sandringham crash after CPS decides against prosecutingBrexit latest odds: Best bets on how (and if) Brexit will happenBrexit vote: What are MPs voting on today, and how will it affect the deal?Isil schoolgirl Shamima Begum \u0026#39will not be rescued\u0026#39, as Security Minister warns \u0026#39actions have consequences\u0026#39Comment: To fix the backstop, Theresa May should push on with the Malthouse CompromiseValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Who was St Valentine and what is the true meaning behind February 14?Senior Philippine journalist arrested amid fears of crackdown on press freedomExeter murders: Neighbours report seeing \u0026#39scruffy looking man with a toolbag\u0026#39 outside victims\u0026#39 homeBoris Johnson: John McDonnell should be \u0026#39utterly ashamed\u0026#39 of calling Winston Churchill a \u0026#39villain\u0026#39British schoolgirl Shamima Begum who joined Isil found in Syria and \u0026#39wants to come home\u0026#39Singer Ryan Adams hits back over claims of sexual misconductWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?Brexit and the Irish border explained: why the headache is not going away any time soonWhy extending Article 50 looks inevitable -

So they decided to act rather than waiting.Right now we are both in good health and able to work, but what if either of us has an accident or becomes ill? We are not allowed to be each other\u0027s guarantors for medical treatment, or to be each other\u0027s heir, Mr Kozumi, a 45-year-old office worker, said in a recent interview with his partner Mr Aiba, 40. Progress in Japan has been too slow.Politician Mizuho Fukushima has spoken out in favour of gay rights in JapanTen Japanese municipalities have enacted partnership ordinances for same-sex couples to make it easier for them to rent apartments together, among other things, but they are not legally binding. Japanese laws are currently interpreted as allowing marriage only between a man and a woman.In a society where pressure for conformity is strong, many gay people hide their sexuality, fearing prejudice at home, school or work. The obstacles are even higher for transgender people in the highly gender-specific society. The Supreme Court last month upheld a law that effectively requires transgender people to be sterilized before they can have their gender changed on official documents.The LGBT equal rights movement has lagged behind in Japan because people who are silently not conforming to conventional notions of sexuality have been so marginalized that the issue hasn\u0027t been considered a human rights problem, experts say.Many people don\u0027t even think of a possibility that their neighbors, colleagues or classmates may be sexual minorities, said Mizuho Fukushima, a lawyer-turned-politician and an expert on gender and human rights issues. And the pressure to follow a conservative family model, in which heterosexual couples are supposed to marry and have children, is still strong.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his ultra-conservative supporters have campaigned to restore a paternalistic society based on heterosexual marriages. The government has restarted moral education class at schools to teach children family values and good deeds.Whether to allow same-sex marriage is an issue that affects the foundation of how families should be in Japan, which requires an extremely careful examination, Mr Abe said in a statement last year.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May risks fresh Brexit humiliation as Tory Brexiteers threaten revolt over Government motion   Prince Harry says rugby changes lives during Q\u0026ampA with England Rugby union co-captain Dylan HartleyGovernments urged to stockpile antibiotics for a future flu pandemic Dispatch: Inside Syria\u0026#39s \u0026#39Camp of Death\u0026#39 where British mothers and children struggle to survive in legal limboFather of Isil bride says the girls are \u0026#39no threat\u0026#39 to Britain as he pleads with Government to allow them to returnA\u0026ampE performance hits all time low Duke of Edinburgh to face no further action over Sandringham crash after CPS decides against prosecutingBrexit latest odds: Best bets on how (and if) Brexit will happenBrexit vote: What are MPs voting on today, and how will it affect the deal?Isil schoolgirl Shamima Begum \u0026#39will not be rescued\u0026#39, as Security Minister warns \u0026#39actions have consequences\u0026#39Comment: To fix the backstop, Theresa May should push on with the Malthouse CompromiseValentine\u0026#39s Day 2019: Who was St Valentine and what is the true meaning behind February 14?Senior Philippine journalist arrested amid fears of crackdown on press freedomExeter murders: Neighbours report seeing \u0026#39scruffy looking man with a toolbag\u0026#39 outside victims\u0026#39 homeBoris Johnson: John McDonnell should be \u0026#39utterly ashamed\u0026#39 of calling Winston Churchill a \u0026#39villain\u0026#39British schoolgirl Shamima Begum who joined Isil found in Syria and \u0026#39wants to come home\u0026#39Singer Ryan Adams hits back over claims of sexual misconductWhat is the Brexit backstop, and why is the Irish border so important to the deal?Brexit and the Irish border explained: why the headache is not going away any time soonWhy extending Article 50 looks inevitable - and the consequences of delaying BrexitWhat is Article 50?

The argument revolves around a feature called envelope tracking, which allows the phones to improve their battery life while they send and receive wireless signals.Qualcomm claimed that some of the non-Qualcomm\u0026nbspchips Apple was using infinged those patents, and should be removed from sale.German courts agreed with Qualcomm, and banned sale of the iPhones that used those chips. That led Apple to completely remove those phones from sale in both its retail and online stores, while an appeal continues.Now Apple said it will put those phones back on sale, but will only use the versions that feature the Qualcomm chips and so will be in line with the court\u0027s decision.The dispute between Apple and Qualcomm has been felt across the world. In December, Apple was also ordered to stop selling some iPhones in China because of a similar argument.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are likely to be negatively affected by any form of Brexit that removes the UK from the customs union but will be hit particularly hard if no agreement is ratified before 29 March.Investment in the British car industry fell by 50 per cent in 2018 as firms held back spending due to Brexit-related uncertainty. A precipitous decline in diesel sales caused by uncertainty about emissions regulations has also damaged the sector.Last week, Toyota slashed its profit forecast for 2019 and warned that it will be impossible to avoid the harmful effects of a no-deal Brexit.“We cannot avoid the negative impact no matter how much we prepare beforehand if Britain leaves the EU with no deal,” the firm’s senior managing officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi said.The industry’s trade body this month said nothing had changed since the 2016 referendum to reassure car manufacturers about the prospects of investing in Britain. And they are “beyond frustrated” with politicians.UK car production fell 9.1 per cent to 1.52 million units in 2018, a five-year low for the sector.With eight out of 10 cars exported, weak demand in many markets, including the eurozone, the UK and China has depressed production.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It was hastily signed despite Seaborne having no ferries, no track record and no contracts with ports at either end of its proposed Ramsgate-to-Ostend route.Weeks after Grayling\u0027s department quietly released the contract notification on Christmas Eve, he announced it had been\u0026nbspcancelled, ostensibly because potential backer Arklow Shipping\u0026nbsphad walked away.How did the ‘no-boats’ ferry contract\u0026nbsphappen?The public spending watchdog released a memo this week on the DfT’s procurement of extra ferry capacity.It found the DfT had struggled to generate any interest from ferry companies to run the extra services. Perhaps as a result of this, the DfT\u0026nbspoffered what looked like a sweetener for the Seaborne deal.The contract promised £3m to the Tory-run council in Thanet\u0026nbspto cover the cost of preparing\u0026nbspthe little-used port of Ramsgate for freight ferries, which hadn’t run a service since the last operator collapsed in 2013.\u0026nbspThe contract would not go ahead without this money. Grayling had assured the Commons that no taxpayers’ money would be spent unless services started. But a dredger, estimated to cost at least £14,000 a day for a month, was clearing the harbour on Wednesday despite no contract being in place.The DfT says it is not paying for it, but it is unclear why or how a private company with no known customers would fund the work unless public backing had been assured.\u0026nbspThe council postponed voting on its budget at the eleventh hour last week after a call from Chris Grayling. Local sources speculate the transport secretary made renewed promises of funding. The DfT would not comment on any assurances.In truth Seaborne Freight is merely one window into the DfT’s handling of the options for air, land and sea routes between the UK and EU after Brexit.The NAO’s memo revealed that Grayling’s department, tasked with preparing the nation\u0027s trade routes, was itself woefully underprepared.The shipless ferry contract isn’t Grayling’s only recent failureLabour demands May sack Grayling amid claims he misled parliamentGrayling’s incompetence sends the worst message about Brexit BritainThe DfT only realised in September that there was an urgent need for more capacity to prevent significant no-deal Brexit disruption at Channel ports supplying more than a fifth of the UK’s goods.It decided not to go through the normal open tender process and instead contacted nine ferry operators privately and asked them to bid.Only three did so. All of them were awarded contracts, but the amount of capacity secured was less than half of what the DfT had hoped.\u0026nbspDespite Theresa May\u0027s claims in the Commons on Wednesday that full due diligence was carried out there was almost no time for checks.\u0026nbspThat didn\u0027t prevent Deloitte, Mott MacDonald and Slaughter and May\u0026nbspcollecting\u0026nbsp£800,000 between them for their advice on the procurement process.But in terms of due dilligence Slaughter and May carried out only a rudimentary “blush test” which checked things like Companies House records. Mott MacDonald and Deloitte both flagged concerns with the latter stating that it was not possible to conduct financial checks on a company with no financial history.Created with Sketch.

And the contracts may never even go ahead if a deal is agreed.\u0026nbspHow much does this matter?These sums are trivial compared to the vast damage that could be wrought by a chaotic no-deal Brexit. The DfT put the cost of six months of disruption at ports without intervention at £5.25bn, others put it higher.A charitable analysis of Grayling\u0027s performance would say that the minister is dealing with a unique\u0026nbspset of circumstances under immense time pressure.However, given what we now know about Seaborne Frieght, what might be uncovered elsewhere\u0026nbspif hundreds of other Brexit preparedness contracts were subject to the same level of scrutiny?\u0026nbspTo take one example, what has happened to the £29m earmarked for Operation Brock Grayling’s plan to turn much of East Kent into an emergency lorry park?Kent county councillor Paul Messenger says many of the roads to be resurfaced as part of the plan simply don’t need it.\u0026nbspThis is just a tiny fraction of the £2bn awarded by government departments in December to get ready for life outside the EU.It seems hopeful to think that the rest has been allocated any more efficiently.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

Instead of looking at all the bad business news today, let’s try and find some positives.\u0026nbspIn so doing I admit I’m rather putting myself in a position like the one the top PR person for BP found themselves in after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, or Volkswagen’s chief spin doctor was faced with after the company was found to have installed software to cheat emissions tests.\u0026nbspYou have to take nuclear strength happy pills to find any positives in the current news flow.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialGovernment admits it has \u0027run out of time\u0027 for no-deal Brexit suppliesWhy has Chris Grayling left the UK\u0027s ports so poorly prepared for BrexMay under fire over \u0027due diligence\u0027 claim in ferry contract fiascoThere\u0027s a reason I used a car company as an example because today Ford held out the prospect of yet more mass lay-offs, while the British Chambers of Commerce said businesses which provide jobs, pay tax, invest in the economy, had been “hung out to dry” by Theresa May’s threat of a no-deal Brexit. The government has admitted it has run out of time for no-deal Brexit supplies and the ports are in no position to cope with what\u0027s coming.\u0026nbspYes, inflation fell, but cheaper energy played a big role and prices are going back up as a result of Ofgem raising its price cap. So it won’t last.\u0026nbspBut wait, we’re not here to criticise. We’re here to sing that Monty Python song, “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life”. So here\u0027s one big consolation from the current mess. However it ends, it should once and for all nail the Tories’ claim to economic competence, or any form of competence come to think of it.\u0026nbspThere is a subset of people that will vote for them because of that. You’ll hear them saying things like, “well I know they\u0027re b******s, but at least they\u0027re b******s that know what they\u0027re doing”.\u0026nbspRight now they\u0027re proving themselves to be just b******s, without even the redeeming feature of being good at it.\u0026nbspNotwithstanding recent polls, that might make it a lot harder for them to get elected than previously when people look at the \u0027Conservative Party Candidate\u0027 under the name of their local MP, particularly if he or she is one of the Brexitremists Prime Minister\u0026nbspMay is in hock to.\u0026nbspIf you have two bad options, but one pays at least lip service to caring about the sick, the poor, the disabled, schools, hospitals etc while\u0026nbspthe other is just\u0026nbspflat out rubbish and mean with it, well, you do the maths.\u0026nbspStill not much of a fan of the Corbynistas, who could be\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspbeneficiaries of this? Well here’s a consolation especially for you, courtesy of Ford’s warning that it will do whatever is necessary to protect itself from May’s hard Brexit.\u0026nbspThat will inevitably mean shutting down car plants and throwing people out of jobs.\u0026nbspFord\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspfar from the only car company set to swing the axe.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing good about being chucked out of a job. It\u0027s\u0026nbsphorrible. I speak from personal experience.\u0026nbspBut it will mean less members and perhaps\u0026nbspless influence for Unite’s Len McCluskey. He’s been palling around with May and Business Secretary Greg Clark of late, and is seen as one of the chief blocks to\u0026nbspLabour doing what it should do and supporting a final say vote, which is about the only thing that could save us from this godawful mess.\u0026nbspSlim pickings, it has to be said, but I did tell you I was taking uber strong happy pills. Wait, I\u0027m feeling the full effect now.\u0026nbspSo maybe Len’s members will be alright after all. Maybe Ford’s warning, and that of the BCC, puts some backbone into the limited number of Tories who are still possessed of a little sanity and actually care about their country.\u0026nbspClark is supposed to be one of them. There are allegedly up to 20 ministers who, we are told, have threatened to walk if May moves to drop the hammer on every last one of us.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

They are likely to be negatively affected by any form of Brexit that removes the UK from the customs union but will be hit particularly hard if no agreement is ratified before 29 March.Investment in the British car industry fell by 50 per cent in 2018 as firms held back spending due to Brexit-related uncertainty. A precipitous decline in diesel sales caused by uncertainty about emissions regulations has also damaged the sector.Last week, Toyota slashed its profit forecast for 2019 and warned that it will be impossible to avoid the harmful effects of a no-deal Brexit.“We cannot avoid the negative impact no matter how much we prepare beforehand if Britain leaves the EU with no deal,” the firm’s senior managing officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi said.The industry’s trade body this month said nothing had changed since the 2016 referendum to reassure car manufacturers about the prospects of investing in Britain. And they are “beyond frustrated” with politicians.UK car production fell 9.1 per cent to 1.52 million units in 2018, a five-year low for the sector.With eight out of 10 cars exported, weak demand in many markets, including the eurozone, the UK and China has depressed production.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The headline inflation rate was widely expected to fall back to 1.9 per cent, with economic uncertainty linked to Brexit and global trade tensions keeping prices down. The Office for National Statistics Consumer Prices Index showed that the largest downward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate came from electricity, gas and other fuels, although these were partially offset by air fares, which decreased at a lower rate than the year before.

As Brexit uncertainty continues to grip the nation it’s hard to be certain which way inflationary pressures will swing. While there is a little breathing space, people should consider how to best shield their money.”Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, said: “Despite the UK labour market remaining tight, political and economic uncertainty have held prices down. “With oil prices low on the back of weaker global demand and air fares tumbling, inflation has kept close to the Bank of England’s target.”She added: “The sluggish UK economy is symptomatic of the wider picture. Central banks across the globe have taken their foot off the stimulus pedal and we are now seeing the results. “With idiosyncratic issues in both the US and Europe slowing growth, Brexit affecting the UK, trade disputes, and a Chinese slowdown, we’re indisputably in a mid-cycle slowdown. “A global recession seems a far-flung prospect, however, in the UK, Carney must be flexible and data-driven, putting decisive monetary policy on the back burner until greater political and economic clarity emerges.” We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved.

Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable. It rightly made stars of its six cast members when it premiered in 1994, and managed to continually evolve through the course of its ten seasons without losing its warm, inimitable charm.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct. After all, if they can do it, anyone can.A staple on ITV3, Inspector Morse is the televisual equivalent of slipping on your favourite slippers: familiar and cosy.

The headline inflation rate was widely expected to fall back to 1.9 per cent, with economic uncertainty linked to Brexit and global trade tensions keeping prices down. The Office for National Statistics Consumer Prices Index showed that the largest downward contribution to the change in the 12-month rate came from electricity, gas and other fuels, although these were partially offset by air fares, which decreased at a lower rate than the year before.

The housing development claims to be affecting time and space, moving people into new places and better futures, fundamentally altering their existenceHowever, he warned: “This might not last long. As Brexit uncertainty continues to grip the nation it’s hard to be certain which way inflationary pressures will swing. While there is a little breathing space, people should consider how to best shield their money.”Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer of Close Brothers Asset Management, said: “Despite the UK labour market remaining tight, political and economic uncertainty have held prices down. “With oil prices low on the back of weaker global demand and air fares tumbling, inflation has kept close to the Bank of England’s target.”She added: “The sluggish UK economy is symptomatic of the wider picture. Central banks across the globe have taken their foot off the stimulus pedal and we are now seeing the results. “With idiosyncratic issues in both the US and Europe slowing growth, Brexit affecting the UK, trade disputes, and a Chinese slowdown, we’re indisputably in a mid-cycle slowdown. “A global recession seems a far-flung prospect, however, in the UK, Carney must be flexible and data-driven, putting decisive monetary policy on the back burner until greater political and economic clarity emerges.” We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

He must carry ampoules for injection in the event of an emergency, but these have a limited shelf-life and he needs regular fresh supplies.He recently went to his usual pharmacy\u0026nbspto obtain a new batch of these life-saving drugs, but was informed by the pharmacist that she did not have them in stock. She told Woodman that “we can’t get hold of them” and explained it was because of Brexit.If Brexit is reversed ‘there will be blood on the streets’The experience of being denied the drugs that he needs to keep himself alive reinforced Woodman’s opposition to the UK leaving the EU. “I am horrified by the biggest act of national self-harm in my lifetime – I am 52 – and probably going back a lot earlier,” he says. “It’s not as bad as going to war, but it’s not far off.”The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nursesHe does not see the political and economic damage as something confined to a post-Brexit future, but as a destructive process that is underway and already inflicting losses among real people. As a regional organiser for Unison in Wales, he deals with the problems of union members such as staff at less well-known and less well-funded universities that can no longer attract foreign students. The prospective students are deterred by Brexit uncertainties over their status and qualifications but formerly paid high fees and were an essential cash-cow for the institutions.Woodman says he is particularly concerned about the University of South Wales. Brexit, he believes, “has the capacity to bankrupt the place because the supply of overseas students has dried up”. Other universities are coming under intense financial pressure, meaning “lecturers and support staff are being let go … I am trying to save my members’ jobs”. He adds that Brexit is exacerbating the crisis in the NHS in Wales because of the difficulty in recruiting foreign doctors and nurses who have hitherto kept it going.Ian Thomas, a psychiatric nurse at Llandough Hospital in the Vale of Glamorgan, agrees that the active recruitment of foreign medical workers has been essential. “The maternity services in Llandough would have collapsed if it was not for the Filipino nurses,” he says.Created with Sketch.

The first concrete signs of this are in higher education and health as well as in international companies such as Airbus and Nissan. But it is the political changes in Britain produced by the 2016 referendum which are more advanced and more visible than the economic ones – and which have the potential to be much more serious.Two very different political trends have gathered pace since the vote to leave the EU and are becoming irreversible: Britain is a far more ided society, perhaps more so than at any time since the Home Rule crises in the 19th and early 20th century and possibly since the turmoil of the 17th century. “People who lived happily next door to each other are now at daggers drawn,” says Woodman. Grievances that have little or nothing to do with the EU\u0026nbsphave been energised and envenomed by the anti-EU vote.Outside Westminster, people are becoming numb to the Brexit crisisCardiff and south Wales are a useful guide to the politics of Brexit in Britain because the outcome of the referendum here helps demolish conventional wisdom about why a majority of those who went to the polls in the rest of Britain wanted to exit the EU.\u0026nbspWales voted Leave\u0026nbspby 52.5 per cent to 47.5 per cent, which surprised some because it receives substantial EU subsidies, amounting to £680m a year, according to the Welsh government. What’s more, Remain\u0026nbspwas backed by the Labour Party, which has dominated Welsh politics for the past 97 years. Yet only five out of 22 local authorities voted to remain, very much mirroring the split in England between poor and better off, less educated and well-educated, old and young.Cardiff, a prosperous-looking city of 350,000 – one of five UK cities most dependent on EU markets – voted 60 per cent to stay in the EU. But the valleys just to the north of Cardiff, a de-industrialised region once filled with coal mines and steel plants, opted strongly for Leave. The pattern of voting was much the same as in England, though the valleys are famous for their strongly-held Welsh identity and loyalty to the Labour Party, something which they were to confirm in the 2017\u0026nbspgeneral election.In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our houseThe outcome of the referendum in Wales puts in doubt the widely credited belief that Brexit was significantly fuelled by resurgent English nationalism and nostalgia for a lost imperial past. This thesis looks less convincing if Welsh socialists, who do not feel the same about the British empire and are still bitter about the crushing of the miners’ strike in 1984-85, voted the same way as English Leavers.Care also needs to be taken when arguing about the degree to which the Brexit vote was propelled by opposition to immigration and Islamophobia, because, while there are many immigrant communities in Cardiff, there are very few in the valleys,\u0026nbspwhere there is not a single mosque according to residents.Of course, the absence of immigrants on the street does not necessarily mean that there is no hostility towards their presence\u0026nbspnationally. Local opinion is split on this, but Graham Simmonds, an independent member of Caerphilly Council who is a Leave supporter, says that emphasis on anti-immigration as an issue in the valleys “is just a stick that the media uses to beat us”. He adds: “I have never encountered it.”Whatever the role of the anti-immigrant vote, there is a simple reason why Cardiff, a government centre with much employment in health and education (it has three universities), should vote differently from the families of former miners and steel workers in the valleys.West Wales and the valleys, once a hub\u0026nbspof the industrial revolution in Britain, today top the list of the five poorest areas in northern Europe, according to 2016 figures. Interestingly, the next four on the list are all in England: Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, Lincolnshire, South Yorkshire, and the Tees Valley and Durham. As in Wales, these deprived regions voted strongly for Brexit, with Lincolnshire having the highest proportion of Leave voters in the UK. Poverty, not national identity, appears to be the dominant factor.UK manufacturers stockpile at record pace in January ahead of BrexitImmigration is an easy explanation for people in deprived areas who want to know why they are jobless or have ill-paid, insecure employment. Pro-Brexit tabloids have for decades drip-fed readers with stories portraying immigrants as parasites on the NHS and the undeserved recipients of largesse through exploiting state benefits.Even so, it is difficult to judge the extent of anti-immigrant feeling, because people are embarrassed to express it and, even when they did in interviews with The Independent, some later asked for their comments to be removed. Police figures for hate crimes or abuse are not very accurate because officers often do not have the resources, the numbers or the inclination to follow such incidents up, according to Cardiff residents.Those from ethnic minorities in the city are better judges of the extent to which the referendum and its aftermath turbo-charged racism in Britain and raised it to a new and more toxic level. Trade union leaders from minority communities (Pakistani, Sikh, Caribbean, Portuguese) spoke to The Independent about their personal experience of racism and about their members who had filed or been the targets of complaints about alleged abuse. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspShavanah Taj is a national officer for the Public and Commercial Services Union, whose father came from Pakistan to work in a steel plant in south Wales in 1958-59. She is married to a Nigerian and has two children aged five and seven. She says that racist abuse has markedly increased in the last three or four years, though she stresses that it was also bad in the past.\u0026nbsp“In the 1980s we used to regularly have dog shit in Tesco bags pushed through our letter box and ‘Pakis Out’ in big letters written on the side wall of our house.” She says this of kind of abuse ebbed in the following years, but has now returned – and strengthened. \u0026nbspAs an Asian woman with two small children, she says she has been harassed by white men who block her way in the street. Invariably, when she walks into a shop “the security guard will follow me around”.For the first time she and her husband are asking themselves if they\u0026nbspwill get to the point when they\u0026nbspno longer think of the areas as\u0026nbsphome.\u0026nbspPreviously, she and her family had never felt it necessary to have a Plan B about where they should live.\u0026nbspNow they wonder if they ought to.Created with Sketch.10 novels to help you beat the Brexit blues Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendLucky Jim by Kingsley Amis Mansfield Park by Jane Austen310 Diary of a Provincial LadyDiary of a Provincial Lady by EM Delafield410 Tales of the CityTales of the City: the Seventies and Eighties gay bible, by Armistead MaupinThe Mating Season by PG WodehouseNot Working by Lisa Owens810 A Gentleman in MoscowA Gentleman in Moscow by Amor TowlesCold Comfort Farm by Stella GibbonsAdrian Mole, The Prostrate Years by Sue TownsendAmarjite Singh, a Sikh who works for the Royal Mail, is branch secretary of the Communications Workers Union and wears a distinctive red turban. He agrees with Taj that open racism receded from the end of the 1980s up to 2016. Other are less sanguine and say there has been mounting Islamophobia propelled by 911, 77 and the rise of Isis after 2014.Singh says\u0026nbspthe most significant change is the degree to which the extreme right is today able to mobilise\u0026nbsppeople. “I haven’t seen so many far-right demonstrations up and down the country ever before with rallies on the same weekend in Birmingham, Leeds and Newcastle,” he says.I know a plasterer who told me that he is now reading a book by Tommy Robinson called ‘Enemy of the State’, which he says is the first book that he has ever readBrexit may originally have been about leaving the EU and about anxiety over immigration from Eastern Europe – indeed, says Singh, many Sikhs voted Leave because they thought foreigners were coming to take their jobs. But then they found that immigrants from the subcontinent and beyond were also targeted.Singh recalls:\u0026nbsp“Two weeks ago I was on a bus and there was a Somali woman with a baby in a pram who could not put it in the space allotted for it because a young man was blocking it. When the bus driver told him to let her park the pram there, the young man replied: ‘Who does she think she is?\u0026nbspShe’s only a foreigner’.”Woodman, whose mother immigrated to the UK from Portugal in 1952 and whose father came from Guyana, agrees that the Brexit vote has exacerbated racism, saying: “It emboldens people, as it does in Trump’s America, to say in public what they used to say in private. I have been called the n-word and that rarely happened in recent years.” He adds that it is wrong to blame everything on Brexit, but he finds it difficult to think of any other explanation for the racist surge.It’s time to call out broken Brexit promises on tradeWhite indigenous residents in south Wales confirm that the extreme right is becoming legitimised in a way that it was not in the past. Ian Thomas, who has long campaigned against racism, says\u0026nbsphe is more worried now than he has ever been before, because he believes that racial hatred, that was always there, but hidden, is coming increasingly to the surface.The rise of the extreme right and open displays of racism have occurred in the past (Oswald Mosley in the 1930s, the Notting Hill riots in the 1950s, Enoch Powell’s “Rivers of Blood”\u0026nbspspeech in 1968, the National Front in the 1970s) but they have peaked and then evaporated or returned to obscurity. Often, they took advantage of periods of acute economic and political instability which came to an end.What is so different about the current crisis over Brexit is that there is no reason why the crisis should come to an end any time soon, and every reason why it should get worse, providing the far-right with fertile ground to expound their racist creed.Not all the arrows point in the same direction and some polls show that hostility to immigrants has receded somewhat since 2016, when Syrian refugees were flooding into Europe and Isis was carrying out highly publicised atrocities in the centre of European capitals.But in the eyes of many people, immigrants remain a threat and the evidence is that this perception has not changed very much. As Woodman says, all that you need to do to generate racial hatred “is to persuade people that those who are different from themselves are the reason they are poor”.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

There’s no cynicism, sneering, or snark here – listening to her naive optimism is like seeing your twitter feed in negative. But the clever thing about Tina Fey’s fast-paced, wise-cracking show is that it isn’t, well, too fey. Kimmy’s zest for life comes from having been held captive in an underground bunker for years rather than being broken by that, she emerges determined to get the most out of life. Four seasons in, there’s still something rather inspiring about that. If you’ve ever dreamt of sacking off the rat race and giving countryside self-sufficiency a try, why not live vicariously through this delightful, warm-hearted Seventies sitcom? Here, though, Tom (Richard Briers) and Barbara (an effortlessly cool Felicity Kendal) don’t quite make it to the countryside, instead attempting to raise goats, pigs, and chickens in their suburban back garden after Tom packs in his corporate job. Buoyed by its wonderful supporting characters, namely the Good’s painfully conventional next-door neighbours Margo and Jerry Leadbetter, The Good Life is an utter joy.310 Pride and PrejudiceThe work of Jane Austen, as a whole, is a kind of the ultimate comfort blanket. She offers us a smart, witty view on the world, where love can be transformative, but should never be pursued at the cost of losing all your senses. The BBC’s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice captures this feeling, and has dynamism to spare. It’s wistful and romantic without feeling naive, anchored by a relatable heroine in Jennifer Ehle’s Elizabeth Bennet, and (of course) features that swoon-worthy, brooding performance from Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. Then there’s the lake scene – need I say more?Five gay American men do a makeover, and it’s fabulous. That’s the basic premise of Queer Eye, a Netflix reboot that introduced the world to the new Fab Five. Each has their area of expertise – Antoni Porowski teaches cooking, Tan France es into wardrobes, Karamo Brown provides life coaching, Bobby Berk re-designs their homes, and Jonathan Van Ness is in charge of grooming – and each one makes the show that little bit special in their own way. Even when the person getting the makeover is at the other end of the political spectrum to our hosts, the show focuses on the positives and shows that everyone, whether they’re democrat or republican, can do with a little self-love.Stars Hollow is excellent in all seasons, as demonstrated by Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LifeThis early Noughties comedy may be the product of its time, but it still makes for deeply unchallenging viewing. A single mother, Lorelai, and her teenaged daughter, Rory, have an upbeat and supportive relationship, speaking in snappy one-liners and rapid-fire dialogue. They live in Stars Hollow, a pastel picture of small town America at its most loveably eccentric. While it delivers poignant emotional truths galore, the focus is blessedly narrow, the stakes untroubingly low, and the outcome usually uplifting. Gilmore Girls has all the bite of a marshmallow – but soft and gooey is, sometimes, just what you need. Could there be a more quintessentially British TV show than The Great British Bake-Off? A batch of contestants try their hardest to impress two judges with their ornate cakes and pastries, all while cheering each other on and become the best of friends. There’s not a whiff of bitterness between them as they leave the tent – only sadness that Paul may never taste their grandma’s macaron recipe. And with the sardonic wit of Mel and SueNoel and Sandi keeping things fun – even when the pressures on – there’s never a mean-spirited moment. Bewitched is absolutely the product of its time, but that’s also what makes it so delightfully subversive. Samantha Stephens (Elizabeth Montgomery) is, on the surface, the ideal housewife of the 1960s. Each episode ends with her household in perfect order, dinner on the table, and a martini ready for her husband the second he walks through the door. Yet the joy of Bewitched comes from the fact that Samantha does these things with a wry smirk. We know she’s a witch, after all, actively choosing to the wear the guise of housewife despite the option to live as an all-powerful, supernatural being. We also know that it’s often her pulling the strings behind-the-scenes on this idyllic marriage. Despite its mid-century suburban sheen, Bewitched is a rebel in disguise. And that’s always enlivening to watch. Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a friendly embrace of a TV series, a sitcom in which all members of its erse ensemble deliver on cheer and belly laughs in each and every episode. Its the endlessly likeable Andy Samberg who leads the charge, and his Peter Pan-style detective Jake Peralta is the kind of character that makes you feel any issue can be resolved. As such, the show offers more of a motivational boost than you might expect for a series about hapless members of a police precinct.

The series ran from 1987 to 2000 and its legacy has lived on through spin-offs Lewis and Endeavour, but neither of which can quite match this series for charm. Sure, the further away we get from the end of Friends’s decade long run, the more blatant its many problematic moments are – but this ensemble sit-com is also enduringly funny, brilliantly acted, and endlessly bingeable.

This all seems very much at\u0026nbspodds with earlier comments from Carney that Brexit could wipe 8 per cent off GDP and that house prices could crash by as much as 35 per cent.On the face of it, this is a conversion to rival Paul’s as he approached Damascus in AD5.

He talked about, among other things, the effects of a slowdown in China. Then he placed Brexit in the context of broader upheavals stemming from globalisation. The crisis in policing shows the danger of a single-issue government“Trade tensions abroad and Brexit debates at home are manifestations of fundamental pressures to reorder globalisation,” Carney said.“It is possible that new rules of the road will be developed for a more inclusive and resilient global economy.”But crucially he then laid out a second point that has conveniently been left out of a number of accounts: “At the same time, there is a risk that countries turn inwards, undercutting growth and prosperity for all.”Carney’s approach here should not surprise anyone. He is an economist and a central banker, not a political pundit. In that role he doesn’t back one side of a debate or another he puts forward a range of possible outcomes, based on analysis.He is used to traders and market commentators poring over and dissecting his every word for a sign of where interest rates are heading, and so he deliberately gives little away.But what about that project fear doom-mongering in months gone by?As it happens, Carney\u0026nbspdidn’t say house prices would crash by 35 per cent or that GDP would drop 8 per cent in a year. In both cases he laid out a number of best, worst and middling scenarios.The middle scenario rarely makes for the best headline.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But few people will feel the impact more sharply than the 3.5 million EU nationals who have built their lives in this country – and who are now having to take steps to secure their right to be here.The government has pledged that all EEA citizens (ie those from the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), their family members and dependents living in the UK on or before 29 March\u0026nbspcan remain in the country with no loss of their rights.The EU Settled Status Scheme, which opened fully last month, is designed to facilitate this, providing – in the words of Sajid Javid –\u0026nbspa “simple, streamlined process for residents and EU citizens and their family members to obtain their new UK immigration status”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut campaigners warn that it risks leaving thousands of EU nationals undocumented – and pushing them straight into the claws of the so-called “hostile environment”.The obligations on employers, landlords and doctors to make routine immigration checks under existing\u0026nbspmeasures mean that anyone who doesn’t obtain settled status before the deadline – 30 June 2021 – could suddenly find themselves unable to work, rent or access healthcare.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentOne of the main concerns is\u0026nbsplack of awareness.

There is real fear that tens of thousands of people will miss the “arbitrary cliff-edge” deadline simply because they do not know about the scheme.There are also concerns that mistakes will be inevitable as the Home Office takes on a\u0026nbspsignificant increase to its caseload.\u0026nbspIt is unclear whether current provisions of staffing and training in the department are sufficient to meet the need – and the number of blunders exposed in the past year suggests it is already struggling. This could leave people wrongly denied settled status simply due to administrative\u0026nbsperrors.Even people who do successfully apply for the Settled Status Scheme could\u0026nbspfeel the force of the hostile environment, as they are suddenly\u0026nbsprequired to prove their immigration status each time they get a new job, rent a home or go\u0026nbspto the GP.Some landlords and employers may start choosing British passport-holders over EU nationals simply to avoid the extra bureaucracy, making them inadvertent victims of dicrimination.The government has made little\u0026nbspattempt to remedy the hostile environment measures which proved so detrimental to Windrush nationals – now EU citizens risk falling into the same trap.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

We even used to ride a tandem bicycle.”\u0026nbspMr and Mrs Marsh celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary on Christmas Day last year. They said they feel gratitude because\u0026nbspthey have a large family, which contributes to maintaining a loving\u0026nbsprelationship\u0026nbspning nearly eight decades.Recounting their approach to money, Cecelia spoke about the frugal times endured when they used credit to buy just one item at a time.\u0026nbspReferring to Mr Marsh, she added: “But that said, if we wanted to buy something, you didn’t mind going out and spending money, did you James!”\u0026nbspMr Marsh, who lives with dementia,\u0026nbspreplied with a quick wit when he said: “Yes, and now I’m skint!”\u0026nbspMr Marsh, whose first job was at a local hardware and iron merchants, added: “When we first met, I thought Cecelia had a lovely way about her.\u0026nbspAfter we were married we were sometimes short on money, but we made a decent home because the kids were growing up.\u0026nbspThere’s more to life than money – you don’t need to make extravagant purchases. And it was nice to get home at the end of the day to a home-cooked meal.”With Valentine’s Day approaching, Ms Marsh said they did not really celebrate it in a big way anymore.\u0026nbsp“We used to - flowers, chocolates, that kind of thing, she said.\u0026nbspShe added they had made cards for each other this year with help from the staff at the\u0026nbspBupa Abbotsleigh Mews care home in Sidcup, South East London where\u0026nbspthey now live.\u0026nbspThey have also planted a rose bush in the grounds to symbolise their\u0026nbspdiamond anniversary.\u0026nbspThe world\u0027s least romantic cities, from Venice to BarcelonaWhy you should buy houseplants instead of flowers this Valentine\u0027s Day10 of the best sex scenes in film“It’s heart-warming to watch their relationship continue to grow even after all these years, and so we all wanted to do something special to mark the occasion, said care home manager Tracey Cheeseman.\u0026nbspAfter the war, Mr Marsh\u0026nbspreturned to work at a local hardware merchants,\u0026nbspand eventually ended up as general manager until he\u0026nbspretired in 1989. \u0026nbspMs Marsh worked as\u0026nbspa trainee seamstress, which meant she\u0026nbspfrequently made clothes for the family. \u0026nbspShe said she was kept busy with sewing, dressmaking and crocheting,\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspwith designing and making wedding dresses.By the time their three children, James, Marion and Ann grew up,\u0026nbspMs Marsh\u0026nbsptook up employment\u0026nbspat the\u0026nbspPeek Freans biscuit factory in Bermondsey.\u0026nbspIn the sixties, she moved on from her job to help Mr Marsh\u0026nbspat Hawkins and Sons, working as a bookkeeper for 20 years.The pair have been retired since 1989 and\u0026nbspup until three years ago, accompanied\u0026nbspeach other to the shops every day.\u0026nbspThe couple have seven grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\u0026nbspMr Marsh said: “Looking back at the old times, I remember we had to learn to work together to overcome any troubles we might have had.”\u0026nbspMs Marsh added: “And if you can see that your family is happy and content, then that makes you happy.\u0026nbspPeople in our generation didn’t ask a lot from life, we were happy with what we had.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

even handing out parchment hearts as a reminder of the love of God or delivering letters between jailed lovers in secret.\u0026nbspThe devastating love story of Camila O\u0027GormanSeven ways to share the love with others in need this Valentine\u0027s DayWhen it comes to the perfect V-Day gift, it’s all about balanceIt is perhaps for these\u0026nbspreasons he has come to be considered the patron saint of love and lovers, a slightly contradictory notion for a faith at other\u0026nbsptimes placing an emphasis on self-denial.An alternative explanation comes from Geoffrey Chaucer, whose Parliament of Foules (1380) mentions: “Saint Valentine’s day, when every bird comes there to choose his mate.”Few details can be substantiated from the saint’s biography relating to romance, the argument goes, so his association with the theme has more to do with fanciful revisionism in the Middle Ages, Chaucer associating his matrydom and feast day with the arrival of spring and the optimism and renewal the season represents.Chaucer’s influence was carried thereafter by the poets, from Shakespeare to John Donne, and by the Victorian era the custom of exchanging cards or gifts as tokens of affection had taken hold.St Valentine’s\u0026nbspskull, crowned with flowers, is on display at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, while the rest of his bodily remains are retained at St Anton’s Church in Madrid, Spain.The one exception is his heart, which\u0026nbsphas been held at Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland, since 1836, where it serves as a site of Christian pilgrammage for those in search of true love.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

It is too small to appear on the world stage on its own.”He also warned that hundreds of companies had plans to relocate across the North Sea from Britain.Government must ‘get its act together’ to prevent Brexit panic-buying “We can’t stop them from coming here,” he said of the news that around 250 UK-based firms had been in talks to relocate to Britain’s closest ally in the EU, to retain access to the single market.“Every businessman I speak to from the UK is saying they will cut investments, cut their business in the UK. It will have an insurmountable impact on the UK,” he told the Financial Times, adding that Britain was a “more diminished country compared to what it was two or three years ago”.Sony and Panasonic are among high-profile names to have cited Brexit in their relocation, but the trade and investment arm of the Dutch government, the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency, has been actively soliciting more firms and says hundreds more are on the verge of moving.Mr Rutte also said Britain’s allies on the continent were aghast at the fact the UK was doing little to stop a no-deal Brexit.“At the moment the ball is rolling towards the Dover cliff and we are shouting ‘Stop the ball from rolling any further’ but nobody is doing anything at the moment, at least not on the UK side,” he said.Responding to Mr\u0026nbspRutte’s comments, the PM’s spokesman said: “I disagree entirely. Employment is at a record high, exports are at a record high, companies are continuing to invest in the UK.“Deloitte named the UK as Europe’s leading destination for foreign direct investment and London as the world’s top city for investment just last month.”Reports out of Westminster and accidental leaks from UK Brexit negotiators suggest Theresa May wants to wait until the very last moment to force her MPs to vote through her Brexit deal.But the brinkmanship raises the prospect of a possible no-deal, as sought by some hardline Conservative MPs.Mr Rutte said that as a result of the exodus the Netherlands had only seen benefits from Brexit so far – though his country could face serious disruption at its ports and airports in the event of a no-deal.Created with Sketch.Politicians\u0027 Brexit tweets don\u0027t hold up well to time or fact Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.These billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThese billboards were plastered by campaign group Led By DonkeysThe Dutch government has sometimes appeared better prepared for Brexit than the UK, with advanced plans to recruit as many as 1,000 extra border officials to deal with potential disruption and extra bureaucracy caused by the UK’s exit.In addition to private businesses, the UK has also lost a key EU agency to Amsterdam: the European Medicines Agency, which employs around 900 highly skilled workers.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

If there is no deal, then the government would have\u0026nbspmake a statement on what the next steps will be.\u0026nbspAmendment E, tabled by Anna Soubry (Conservative) - tabled by anti-Brexit MPs,\u0026nbspcalls for publication of the most recent official briefing document relating to business and trade on the implications of a no-deal Brexit presented to cabinet.”.Amendment I, tabled by Ian Blackford (SNP) -\u0026nbspwould require the government to negotiate an extension of at least three months to the Article 50 process.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspStrong words from Theresa May\u0027s official spokesman in response to John McDonnell\u0027s criticism of Sir Winston Churchill. Speaking at the morning No 10 briefing for Westminster journalists, he\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbspThe British public will reach its own judgment on this characterisation of Sir Winston Churchill. I note that in 2002 he came first in a public poll of the 100 greatest Britons.The prime minister has quoted and referenced Sir Winston Churchill on many occasions and acknowledged him as one of the great prime ministers of the 20th century.She has a portrait of Sir Winston Churchill hung on the wall of her study in Number 10.His strong leadership, determination and unwavering personality inspired our country through our darkest hour and helped Britain protect those values of peace and freedom that we hold so dear today.Andrea Leadsom has just read out a Valentines Day poem in the Commons..\u0026nbspThe Leader of the House said:Labour is redTories are blueOur future is brightWith\u0026nbspa good deal in sightFor the UK and our friends in the EU\u0026nbspIn response the SNP\u0027s Pete Wishart\u0026nbsppenned a few lines of his own prose. He said:\u0026nbspLabour is redTories are blueThe message from Scotland is we are staying in the EU\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPA have produced this very helpful summary of the key amendments MPs are likely to vote on tonight...\u0026nbspGovernment motionThis apparently innocuous motion asks the House to welcome Ms May\u0027s statement on Tuesday, setting out progress in Brexit talks, note that talks on the Irish backstop are ongoing and reiterate its support for the approach to negotiations agreed the last time MPs voted, on 29 Janaury. The problem for the government is that MPs voted that day not only to authorise the PM to go back to Brussels and seek a replacement for the controversial Irish backstop, but also for a non-binding motion which would rule out a no-deal outcome. Leave-supporting backbenchers from the European Research Group fear that this would effectively mean signing up to a bar on no-deal.Labour amendmentTabled by Jeremy Corbyn and his frontbench, this would require the government to either call a vote on its withdrawal plan by 27 February or hand control to Parliament to decide the next steps. Liberal Democrats have tacked on their own amendment to this proposal, calling for a second referendum as endorsed by the Labour Party conference.Alternative voteA cross-party amendment tabled by the Father of the House, veteran Tory europhile Kenneth Clarke, would allow MPs to vote on their preferred Brexit outcome. Any Brexit option which secures the signatures of 50 or more MPs would be included on a ballot paper, and MPs would be asked to rank them in order of preference. Using an alternative vote system, the least popular option would be excluded and second-preference votes redistributed until one outcome has more than half the votes. There would then be a vote in the Commons on this option. This proposal has the backing of senior Labour backbenchers including Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey as well as Tory Remainers Dominc Grieve and Anna Soubry.Revoke Article 50Tabled by the Scottish National Party\u0027s Angus MacNeil and backed by Mr Clarke, this amendment calls on the government to revoke the letter informing the European Council of the UK\u0027s intention to leave the EU under Article 50 of the treaties, thus ending the Brexit process and allowing Britain to remain a member of the EU.Publish the papersThis amendment - backed by 60 critics of Brexit from across the House - instructs the Government to publish its most recent official briefings on the implications of a no-deal Brexit for business and trade. Tablers Anna Soubry and Chuka Umunna believe the papers presented to Cabinet paint a chilling picture of the damage which no-deal will do.Indicative votesThis calls for a series of votes on 26 February\u0026nbspon various Brexit options including the PM\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement, no-deal, renegotiation of the backstop, a Canada-style deal, Norway-style membership of the EEA and a second referendum. If only one option wins a majority, Ms May would be required to ask for an extension to Article 50 beyond its March 29 deadline to pursue that outcome. If two or more won majorities, the PM would be required to hold a public vote on those options. If none commanded a majority of MPs, Mss May would have to call a second referendum with the options of her deal or Remain. Tabled by Conservative Remainer Sarah Wollaston, the proposal has backing from opponents of Brexit across the House.Plaid Cymru optionBacked by the Welsh nationalist party\u0027s four MPs, this requires the Government to extend Article 50 to provide time for a referendum on Ms May\u0027s deal or Remain. If no extension is allowed by the EU, the government would be required to commit itself to a referendum at the end of the transition period in 2021 on whether the UK should rejoin the EU.Close alignmentAn amendment signed by a small group of Labour and Plaid MPs, and tabled by Swansea West\u0027s Geraint Davies, would require an extension of Article 50 and a commitment from the PM to seek a deal - subject to ratification in a referendum - which leaves the option open for future governments to adopt Labour\u0027s current vision for post-Brexit relations with the EU, including a customs union and close alignment with the single market.SNP optionTabled by the SNP\u0027s Westminster leader Ian Blackford, this would require the government to negotiate an extension of at least three months to the Article 50 process.Liberal Democrat amendmentLiberal Democrats led by Sir Vince Cable are proposing an extension to Article 50 beyond March 29 to allow time for a second referendum with Remain on the ballot paper.Three-option referendumTabled by Labour backbencher Roger Godsiff, this would require any withdrawal agreement approved by Parliament to be put to the public in a referendum. The ballot paper would have three options - to accept the agreement, leave with no deal or remain in the EU - and voters would be asked to rank them in order of preference under the alternative vote system.Security minister\u0026nbspBen Wallace\u0026nbsphas said the government will not help\u0026nbspShamima Begum, the schoolgirl who fled\u0026nbspto join Isis in 2015 and has now been found by\u0026nbspThe Times\u0026nbspliving in a Syrian refugee camp.\u0026nbspHe told BBC Radio 4\u0027s\u0026nbspToday that actions have consequences, saying:The UK advises against all travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Anyone who does travel to these areas, for whatever reason, is putting themselves in considerable danger.Everyone who returns from taking part in the conflict in Syria or Iraq must expect to be investigated by the police to determine if they have committed criminal offences, and to ensure that they do not pose a threat to our national security.There are a range of terrorism offences where iniduals can be convicted for crimes committed overseas and we can also use Temporary Exclusion Orders to control an iniduals\u0027 return to the UK.I\u0027m not putting at risk British people\u0027s lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state - there\u0027s consular services elsewhere in the region and the strong message this government has given for many years is that actions have consequences.Tory MP Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, has also criticised John McDonnell for calling the wartime prime minister a villain.\u0026nbspMr Soames said:\u0026nbspFrankly, it\u0027s a very foolish and stupid thing to say, surely said to gain publicity.I think my grandfather\u0027s reputation can withstand a publicity-seeking assault from a third-rate, Poundland Lenin. I don\u0027t think it will shake the world.\u0026nbspMPs will vote tonight on whether to agree to give Theresa May more time for Brexit talks with the EU.\u0026nbspThe motion says further time is needed to secure concessions on the backstop, which Ms May believes will be enough to win parliament\u0027s backing for her Brexit deal.\u0026nbspBut the prime minister is facing the prospect of another defeat, with Eurosceptic MPs set to either abstain or vote against the government motion because they say it rules out a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspIn reality, the vote is largely symbolic, with Ms May likely to carry on regardless in a bid to secure changes that Brussels insists are impossible...The latest showdown comes as European Council president\u0026nbspDonald Tusk\u0026nbspexpressed frustration at a lack of progress in London.He tweeted: No news is not always good news. EU27 still waiting for concrete, realistic proposals from London on how to break Brexit impasse.And Dutch PM Mark Rutte told the Financial Times the Netherlands is already benefiting from businesses relocating from a diminished Britain.In a bid to keep lines open with EU leaders, Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbspspoke with French president Emmanuel Macron and Romanian president Klaus Iohannis on Wednesday evening.But she faces an immediate threat in the Commons as Tory Brexiteers have expressed concern at the thrust of part of the Government motion.Many back the fact it reiterates support for the direction agreed on January 29, when MPs supported an amendment authorising Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbspto return to Brussels to renegotiate the controversial Irish backstop.But members of the backbench European Research Group (ERG) say that it effectively endorses another amendment approved by MPs that day, which rules out no-deal but is not binding on the Government.Though Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0026nbspis expected to be able to weather a defeat on the Government motion, such an outcome would be embarrassing as she seeks to get the EU to agree to changes regarding withdrawal proposals.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

We will continue to explore all possible options to secure additional freight capacity to ease pressure on the Dover straits in the event of a no deal Brexit, including through the port of Ramsgate.”\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

If there is no deal, then the government has to make a statement on what the next steps will be.Liberal Democrats have tacked on their own amendment to this proposal, calling for a second referendum as endorsed by the Labour Party conference.Tabled by the SNP\u0027s Westminster leader Ian Blackford, this would require the government to negotiate an extension of at least three months to the Article 50 process.Tory Anna Soubry and Labour\u0027s Chuka Umunna are leading calls for publication of the most recent official briefing document relating to business and trade on the implications of a no-deal Brexit presented to cabinet.”.These amendments were not selected:Tory grandee Ken Clarke (c)\u0026nbsp- Allow MPs to vote on different optionsParliamentarians will vote on a number of different scenarios, ranking them in order of preference. Any option can get on the ballot paper if more than 50 MPs back it. This idea - known as indicative votes - was mooted at the last clash.This proposal has the backing of senior Labour backbenchers including Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey as well as Tory Remainers Dominc Grieve and Anna Soubry.Mr MacNeill, the chair of the international trade committee, has tabled this amendment to revoke article 50 before March 29.This amendment by pro-EU MP Dr Wollaston demands votes on February 26 on various Brexit options including the PM\u0027s deal, no-deal, renegotiation of the backstop, a Canada-style deal, Norway-style membership of the EEA and a second referendum.If none commanded a majority of MPs, Mrs May would have to call a second referendum with the options of her deal or Remain.Backed by the Welsh nationalist party\u0027s four MPs, this requires the government to delay Brexit to allow \u0026nbspfor a referendum on Ms May\u0027s deal or Remain.

But the problem is MPs voted not only to authorise the PM to go back to Brussels and seek a replacement for the Irish backstop, but also for a non-binding motion which would rule out a no-deal outcome.Leave-supporting backbenchers from the European Research Group fear that this would effectively mean signing up to a bar on no-deal.3 Why does the result matter?These votes are non-binding on the government but Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, warned Brexiteers that a defeat on the motion could hamper Ms May\u0027s chances of securing concessions from Brussels.The prime minister is trying to persuade the EU to offer legally binding changes to her deal - and senior figures are watching closely.If she cannot even get a neutral motion through parliament, they may be reluctant to offer concessions that could be voted down.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

(But is the EU really hanging on a non-binding motion at 5pm on a Thursday afternoon?)“Conservative MPs really ought not to be associated with anything, express or implied, which seems to take no deal off the table.“Compromising no deal would be the daftest negotiating strategy and not in the national interest.“Today’s storm in a teacup only arises because the government’s motion is not neutral.

They were murdered as part of a bloody turf war with Al Capone’s Italian contingent, the two factions fighting for control of Chicago’s illegal liquor black market, catering to underground speakeasies since the 18th amendment had banned the production, import or sale of alcohol in 1920.The two sides had been at war\u0026nbspsince North Side boss Dean O’Banion was shot in the back of the head while clipping chrysanthemums in his North State Street flower shop on 10 November 1924. When the Chicago Outfit’s leadership was subsequently passed on from the experienced Johnny Torrio to the less even-tempered Capone, violence became a way of life on the city’s streets.Torrio and Capone narrowly escaped attempts on their lives but O’Banion’s successor, Hymie Weiss, was not so lucky. The St Valentine’s Day Massacre was reportedly planned as a hit on Moran after he had avenged Weiss’s murder by taking out Pasqualino Lolordo, one of Capone’s made men.On 14 February, the North Siders were set up by an undercover Capone contact, who promised a shipment of Canadian whiskey hijacked from the Italians would be delivered to the SMC Cartage Company garage at 2122 North Clark Street.Moran’s men arrived before 10.30am to meet the incoming truck but, in a peculiar quirk of fate, the target himself was running late. A police car promptly arrived outside, bearing two men dressed in uniform and two more in civilian clothes. Moran, pulling up just in time to spot the quartet entering the building, quietly moved on.The four entered the depot, cornered the men and ordered them to line up against a rear wall. A hail of gunfire erupted from a brace of Thompson submachine guns and a shotgun. The perpetrators duly made a getaway in the squad car, never to be identified.\u0026nbspThe only survivor was a German shepherd named Highball, his lead tied to a parked car’s bumper nearby.The dead included Moran’s right-hand man and deputy Albert Kachellek, bookmaker Adam Heyer, business manager Albert Weinshenker, two brother enforcers – Frank and Peter Gusenberg – as well as two associates, optician-turned-gambler Reinhardt Schwimmer and mechanic John May.\u0026nbspWhen the real cops arrived, Frank Gusenburg was still alive despite being riddled with 22 bullets but refused to say who did it, dying in hospital still loyal to the thieves’ code of honour he had lived by.The killings, reported on every front page in America, provoked a public outcry.\u0026nbsp“From coast to coast, people suddenly seemed to be reaching the conclusion that a line had been crossed, that the violence had become too much to bear,” wrote Capone biographer Jonathan Eig.President Herbert Hoover met with city elders and duly instructed his attorney general, William Mitchell, to “get Capone”. Though widely suspected of having ordered the hit, the mobster was careful to be in Florida at the time it was carried out.\u0026nbspWhy do people still admire the Kray Twins?His bodyguard, “Machine Gun” Jack McGurn, was arrested and accused of being the mysterious connection who had set up the whiskey plot, but no case could be made against him. He said he had spent the day with his girlfriend, Louise Rolfe, and quickly married her to ensure she could not be pressured into testifying against him. She was thereafter popularly referred to by the press as the “Blonde Alibi”.Ballistics experts did trace the Tommy guns used in the massacre to the Michigan home of one Fred “Killer” Burke. A career criminal with ties to Egan’s Rats and the Purple Gang – mobs out of St Louis, Missouri\u0026nbspand Detroit, Michigan, respectively – Burke went on the run after he was involved in a car accident in December 1929 and killed the investigating police officer, Charles Skalay, in a moment of panic.\u0026nbspBriefly on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list, Burke was found hiding out on a farm in Green City, Missouri, when a local man recognised his mugshot in a copy of True Detective magazine. He was imprisoned for the murder of Skalay in March 1931 and died nine years later of a heart attack.Though the Valentine’s Day killings were never successfully pinned on him, the murder weapons were found in Burke’s possession and he was missing a front tooth, a detail that matched an eyewitness description of one of the ersatz officers spotted fleeing the scene.\u0026nbspThe remaining killers are thought to have come from a St Louis gang known as the “American Boys”.\u0026nbspA criminal named Byron Bolton\u0026nbsptold the FBI in 1934 the Valentine’s Day hit squad had consisted of Burke and American Boys Fred Goetz, Gus Winkeler, Raymond “Crane Neck” Nugent and Bob Carey, apparently modifying the truth to exclude the fact he himself had served as lookout, hence his inside knowledge. Oddly, the bureau’s director J Edgar Hoover left the matter to local police rather than acting on the tip-off.Al Capone was finally brought down for tax evasion in 1931, the result of an extensive investigation by the Treasury’s Special Intelligence Unit\u0026nbspled by Elmer Irey and the work of agent Eliot Ness and his team of “Untouchables”, men who could not be bribed.Capone spent\u0026nbsphis final days on the island prison of Alcatraz in the San Francisco Bay.We’ll tell you what’s true.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves. There may be trouble ahead.But those who voted in their millions in  to leave have not budged. If anything, their mood has hardened.In a second referendum, a straight choice between Leave and Remain would turn Brexit into a landslide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s why we have rigorous safety standards.

Their foolishness means Britain must give away a fixed . per cent of national income at a time when global poverty is plummeting due to capitalism, scientic progress and technological advances.Now some Tories are trying to find ways to keep their promise to hit this aid target, while spending the money in fresh ways. That exposes the ­shallowness of ministers’ ­posturing as heroic saviours of the poor and dispossessed.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told the Cabinet last month this level of aid spending was “unsustainable” and money should be shted to domestic priorities.She has floated the idea of ­building new ships for the Royal Navy from the aid ­budget by using them for humanitarian operations.And she knows the issue will rear up in any forthcoming Tory leadership battle.Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson chipped in, saying Britain needs more control over what counts as foreign aid under international rules — and that it should go towards boosting British foreign policy objectives.His move was linked to a report by former soldier turned Tory MP Bob Seely arguing that Britain should simply define its own aid spending to include our ­“strategic goals”.Yet they all miss the obvious solution. Just DITCH the target and abandon the  law binding us to it — one that makes the Department for International Developmentthe only ministry that must explain itself to MPsit fails to spend enough.This silly UN target is an historic anachronism devised by campaigners half a century ago based on flawed, outdated economic data.It makes no sense to rely on a fixed spending target based on national income over needs in poor places — as predicted by a former Tory Chancellor, respected Labour peers and a British economist who won the Nobel Prize for their expertise in poverty.One horried DfID minister confessed to me he thought spending was at least TRIPLE what it should be — yet whenever he tried to thwart wasteful projects, they simply bounced back from officials on to his desk again.It was no surprise to find those pen-pushers in the poverty relief department are among the best-paid bureaucrats in Whitehall.This torrent of cash has fuelled a self-serving aid industry stuffed with fat cats on six-figure salaries in charities and private firms.These people are so focused on protecting their valuable brands that some of the best-known organisations covered up abuse, rape, malpractice and theft.Their political paymasters pose as municent saviours of the world. Yet as I have seen on three continents, much of the money taken from taxpayers is blown on ludicrous projects based on bogus statistics — and ends up doing more harm than good by fostering conflict and undermining democracy.I was in Ghana last year, investigating a UK-funded scheme to pour cash into a few villages to prove aid works.“Far from breaking the poverty trap, the project does not appear to have reduced poverty or hunger at all,” concluded DfID’s own report.Yet we give cash to fast-emerging powerhouses such as China and India.We give cash to countries riddled with corruption, such as Uganda, where I found officials inflating the number of refugees to grab more funds from foreign donors.We give cash to places that have space programmes, even their own aid agencies.And we pour cash into countries run by gangsters spending huge sums on weapons — and in Rwanda’s case, on the brutal president’s favourite Premier League football club, Arsenal.Even North Korea, which runs massive death camps under a bloodstained family dictatorship, has been a beneficiary of UK aid. This is what happens when politicians prioritise spin and spending over needs and reality.Holland has showed a country can get off this hook. It abandoned the target and found the anticipated fuss died down quickly.The sht led to renewed focus on efficient spending, with fewer countries receiving donations. “We were surprised it was so easily dealt with,” one insider told me.Dutch spending has dipped from . per cent of national income in  to . per cent last year and will fall again over the coming years.Let us welcome the dawning realisation in Westminster that fixating on an aid target has been a dire failure.Instead of tinkering with definitions — or deceiving voters by slipping domestic spending under the foreign aid banner — politicians should accept their mistake and abandon that daft targetOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The BBC — fuelled by £billion of public money — has expanded into a state-backed media monster encroaching on areas that should be none of its business, from trivial “clickbait” stories to lestyle advice.After all, the BBC Charter states that it should “provide impartial news and information to help people understand  the world around them. It should offer depth and analysis not widely available from other UK news providers”.Somewhere, this has gone very wrong.It churns out so much stuff online that it could be renamed the British Publishing Corporation.In the process, the monster is devouring the market for everything from local newspapers to gossip websites.Why does “our” national broadcaster now feel obliged to publish “news” stories such as the classic “Serial poopers: What makes people poop in public ” The BBC is also hopelessly addicted to pumping out recipes. Type in “spaghetti bolognese” on Google and the first result that s is from BBC Good Food — a commercial site that trades on the broadcaster’s brand.Why is the BBC even in the already-crowded recipe market  Never heard the one about “too many cooks” By stretching its insensitive tentacles into local areas from its London and Salford HQs, the BBC has contributed to wrecking the local and regional Press, longstanding voices of real communities.At least  local and regional titles have closed since , as circulation halved from .million weekly in  to .million in .Since , the number of regional journalists has also been halved, to around ,.An estimated  per cent of the country now has no daily or weekly title.A robotic BBC web page is no substitute for local Press coverage of council meetings and court proceedings.And yet the money pours in to fund this expansion way beyond its remit.Last year the BBC spent £million on BBC Online and “Red Button” services. The national and local Press are under siege from the tech giants and their BBC collaborators. But this is about more than newspaper self-interest.The future of dirt-digging journalism and democratic debate is at stake.Cairncross estimates that “legacy newsbrands” — aka national and local newspapers — are responsible for around  per cent of all original news journalism in the UK, more than broadcasters and online-only outlets put together. That seems an underestimate.The role of the Press in reporting the news is not just a matter of historical “legacy”. As one ex-editor of a London local paper observes, “councillors and crooks must surely feel relaxed” without local hacks watching and reporting what they are up to.Every big story of recent years was broken by newspapers, from the fire risk Vauxhall Zafira and how Age UK pushed expensive power deals to OAPsto Philip Green gagging reports of sexual and racial harassment .Even last year’s most popular BBC-based story — the snogging scandal on Strictly Come Dancing — was a Sun on Sunday exclusive, before the BBC did its usual parasitical trick of topping Google searches for articles about “the Strictly Curse”.The newspaper tradition of long-form writing and forensic examination will continue to struggle as the online purveyors suck up adverts for cheap and cheerful clickbait.The print medium remains unmatched for serious analysis.Yet the BBC’s self-aggrandising aim is now to expand its global audience further, rather than meet the needs of the underserved as a public service broadcaster surely should.Thus the social media chief of BBC News, Mark Frankel, boasts of the corporation having on Facebook “the largest news page and total fanbase of any news organisation in the world”.The publicly funded BBC need not care that the tech giants don’t pay for stories, as for them Facebook is just a free publicity funnel.That alliance makes it even harder for the rest of the media to take a stand against being royally ripped off.Auntie is effectively in league with greed-driven tech giants.What of the output of all these BBC s  They claim to be a beacon of liberal ersity.The one thing the BBC can’t tolerate, however, is ersity of opinion.It is a bastion of illiberal luvvie smugness, peddling its elitism as the centre ground, blasting out conformist propaganda in Brexit-bashing  debates and Brexit-bashing comedy shows.Lord Reith, the first BBC chief, wanted the then-monopoly corporation to “inform, educate and entertain” the public, from the point of view of the British Establishment.Reith’s successors might have quite a dferent world view.But the new BBC establishment —  managers paid between £, to £, a year,  on between £, to £, — would love to have a state-backed news monopoly again, educating and informing the ignorant public, whether we like it or not.Those of us who appreciate the importance of a vibrant and erse media to democracy, should tell the BBC to get its tanks off the free Press’s lawn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he’s broken it, Mills  Boon style, “into a million pieces”.No one is suggesting that Meghan isn’t upset by the way her father and other off-message relatives have behaved — who wouldn’t be But this supposedly “private” attempt to build bridges lacks authenticity.Decades of dealing with PR spin designed to deflect suspicious journalists away from the real storyhas taught me to trust my gut instinct.And given Thomas’s previous form on speaking to the Press, it’s telling me that Meghan wrote this rather staged letter in the expectation that he would leak it and, therefore, seamlessly allow her to peddle her own narrative while maintaining the cover of the innocent party who has been betrayed by her own father yet again.But Thomas kept the letter under wraps. Until, that is, he was baited in to defending himself against claims made by some of Meghan’s close friends, who spoke anony-mously , about the duchess’s plight to the US-based People magazine.One said: “After the wedding she wrote him a letter. She’s like, ‘Dad, I’m so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationship’.”Look, Thomas Markle is by no means blameless. He did a deal with the paparazzi for staged photos, is clearly given to petulance, has only released the parts of the letter that suit him and, as the parent in this scenario, should be the one to stop this tit-for-tat soap opera and just shut the hell up.But equally, any sympathy one might have felt for Meghan in dealing with her off-message family is evaporating fast in the face of such a blatant PR exercise that has her manicured fingers all over it.One of the friends who spoke out has “let it be known” that the duchess herself knew nothing of them speaking to People magazine.Sorry, but I just don’t buy it. Meghan has form for dropping friends like hot potatoesthey displease her, so the notion that those who remain “close” would speak to the Press — anonymously or otherwise — without approval is, to my mind, utter bunkum.Which leads me to conclude that this was a ham-fisted, Hollywood-esque attempt to try to manipulate Press coverage and put a stop to, as her friends put it, the “global bullying” of The Duchess of Sussex. But it has backfired badly.Yes, plenty of the criticism levelled at Meghan is unfair, and some of it is downright offensive.But as the rest of the Royal Family could tell her, they’ve all suffered their share of brickbats over the years but come through it.How  By earning respect through dutul and consistent hard work, not demanding it early doors via an ill-conceived PR initiative.JENNIFER ANISTON has just celebrated her th birthday.Or “poor Jen” as she’s frequently referred to because she’s single and childless which, obviously, is something to be pitied because marriage and giving birth defines us.Meanwhile, back in the real world, the single le appears to suit the fierce Ms A very well indeed.She says she considered her marriages to be successful, but when the end came: “This is our one le and I would not stay in a situation out of fear. Fear of being alone.“To stay in a marriage based on fear feels like you’re doing your one le a disservice.”She’s right, of course. But moving on is far simpler when you don’t have children together.If you do, then taking the decision to break up the family home is a far tougher one.Because your kids only have “one le” too.NOW US teenager Ethan Lindenberger has turned , he has finally had the MMR vaccination while criticising his “anti-vaxxer” movement parents for refusing to give it to him when he was younger.His mother, Jill Wheeler, who believes that vaccinations cause illnesses such as autism, says his decision is “insulting” and a “slap in the face”.Ethan, from Ohio, did his own research into the jab and commented on social media site Reddit, “God knows how I’m still alive” – presumably a reference to the fact that measles can be deadly.He probably swerved it thanks to all the parents who recognise the need for herd immunity and do have their children vaccinated.PARENTS in America say that regular viewing of children’s TV show Peppa Pig is causing their kids to start speaking in a British accent.Many moons ago, I went to collect my youngest from her first day at nursery and was greeted by an excited young assistant who hailed from Valencia.“I didn’t know your daughter could speak Spanish!”“Neither did I,” I replied.Turns out that rather too much time in front of Dora The Explorer had indeed been educational.LUNG cancer screening units are to be offered in supermarket car parks across the UK in an NHS bid to improve early detection rates.This reminds me of when a mobile cervical cancer screening unit was set up in a Birmingham car park in the s and an elderly lady approached the receptionist.She was directed to a curtained booth, given a smear test, then emerged to declare: “I’ve never had to do this to get a bus pass before.”NETFLIX documentary Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened is proof,needed, that all on Instasham etc is not what it seems.The Fyre festival was the brainchild of US “entrepreneur” Billy McFarland, now serving six years in prison for fraud, aided and abettedby a close coterie of consultants, marketeers, media experts andonline “influencers” who helped sell the dream of an exclusive event on a luxury, Bahamian island to unsuspecting, albeit wealthy punters who turned up to find a nightmare of soggy tents, bad food and no headline acts.Among those who appeared in a promotional video and posted the event’s distinctive “orange tile” to their millions of followers to help drive ticket sales were models Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski.Most notably, model Kendall Jenner was paid an eye-watering , via wire transfer for just one post about it to her million-plus followers.It shows with compelling clarity that while the power of A-list, online influence is real, what’s being promoted can sometimesbe a Grade A dud.So, buyer beware of those “influencers” who only post for favours or cash.They’re just the social media version of the old-fashioned freeloader.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what do you reckon the likelihood is of the deadline being put back  I’ll bet it is.Olly Robbins thinks it’s likely. He’s a civil servant and the Prime Minister’s chief negotiator to the EU. He was overheard jabbering about the whole business in a bar in Brussels. And he saidthere WERE a delay, it would most likely be a long one.We’ll probably all be here this time next year, then, in exactly the same position.By which time the deal will be so watered down, the whole point will have been lost. It’s pretty close to that stage right now.Why has this happened  Because our establishment do not want us to leave. And while they may pay lip service to “respecting the voice of the people”, they don’t remotely mean it. They never did.And so, on the one hand we have establishment voices — Blair, Mandelson, Heseltine — and a growing number of current politicians demanding we must have another vote. Because we got it wrong last time.The European Union has a history of ignoring popular votes and getting countries to run the vote again, after a slew of propaganda about why the people were so wrong.Then, on the other hand, we have a Prime Minister who voted Remain leading our negotiations. And at every stage of the process more and more has been given away.We started from a position of weakness by allowing the EU to dictate the order of the negotiations. So they got to demand things from us — such as extortionate amounts of money — before we even got down to talking about our trading relationship.And at every stage the deal has got weaker. Every time she came back from Brussels, something more had been given away. Until we reach today’s position, where the deal before us isn’t really leaving the EU at all.We’ll still be tied to the customs union for the foreseeable future. We will still have the horrible European Court of Justice telling us what we can and can’t do for another two years.And there are plenty of people who believe that the famous issue of the Northern Ireland backstop is simply an attempt to get us to remain, for ever, inside the customs union.Here’s what I think will happen.Brexit will, in the end, be delayed. And by the time a deal is put before us again — months down the line — it will bear no real resemblance to “leaving the European Union”.And so those of us who have no trust in our liberal establishment, because we know what scant respect it has for democracy, will be able to say: “Told you so.

The truth is that Meghan is not remotely being hunted by photographers and enjoys extraordinary freedoms.The paparazzi do not stalk her like they did the Princess of Wales — although they were often tipped off about where Diana would be.Snappers were told  when she was going for lunch  with a friend, dressed up to the nines, or out for a night on the town in a sizzling frock. She had her favourite writers and her favoured photographers.But the only paparazzi pictures ever to have been published of Meghan were taken when the story first broke that she was romantically linked with Harry.This was a genuine news story. But because their media minders at Kensington Palace refused to issue an official photo of the couple together, they had created a market for one, and every paparazzo was desperate to get the first photo of them together.Since then, in all her public engagements, she has been closely monitored by the Palace Press team. Even her wedding pictures were so tightly controlled that just one Press agency was allowed to photograph the marriage service inside St George’s Chapel in Windsor last May.As a result, Meghan can quite happily live as a semi-private citizen in her palace.She comes and goes when and where she wants, with no photographers following her.We know precious little about the le she and Harry lead in London or at their luxury bolthole in Oxfordshire.Yes, she likes Soho Farmhouse and she writes on bananas — but that’s about it.Like everyone in the public eye, she is trolled on social media. Palace aides supposedly “spend hours” deleting hateful comments — but why bother  Why not simply ignore it  Their PR advisers hope to bypass the traditional media by controlling the photographs and stories they release.Meghan deleted her own social media accounts when she and Harry became engaged.  Perhaps the Royal Family should do the same. Instagram does not equal real le.When The Sun accurately reports about Meghan in fairly harmless stories, their frankly second-rate PR people set lawyers on us.Yet the biggest invasion of her privacy was triggered by Meghan herself, after she gave consent to friends to talk to People magazine in America last week about the awful relationship she has with  her dad.Although there have been stories about the “dficult Duchess” and the fall-out with Kate, most of her problems stem from back home in the USA.Meghan’s father Thomas Markle, her half-sister Samantha — who Meghan says she barely knows — and her cannabis-grower half-brother Thomas Jr, have only ever said disparaging things about the Duchess.I suspect that Meghan knew the letter she sent to her dad last August would be published and she used it to make sure the world knew she was disgusted with the lies being told by her family.Meanwhile, in his bid to “protect” his we, Prince Harry — once the Press photographers’ favourite among the royals —  has gone from hero to zero in his relationship with the media.I have asked twice for Meghan to meet Britain’s royal correspondents but so far it has not happened. If she did, I am sure her profile would improve.Despite being surrounded by great wealth and privilege, the young royals seem to have been seduced by the cult of victimhood.Harry talked about his anxiety and stress and Meghan is a victim of “global bullying” — whatever that means.Meghan really needs to lighten up. So does Harry.The pair of them should look across the road at Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales, and his lovely we Camilla, who has had more hostile Press coverage than any other member of  the Royal Family, including Diana.But they just worked harder and harder to win people over, and Camilla’s approval rating is now sky high and she will certainly be our Queen.Every job I have been on with Meghan she has been the star of the show. She engages brilliantly with people and is a true royal star.My main hope is that this phoney war with the media — that they started and which has now been  intensied by their friend Clooney — comes to an end before the Press loses interest.Newspapers and websites could, after all, simply stop covering Harry and Megan’s engagements, which I’m not sure would please either of them.So stick to acting, George, because there is no part for you in this royal soap opera.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The skin and ear lips are what move primarily.And while the five-year-old pooch does have a few other medical challenges, Heather says Toads le is mostly normal.She doesnt hear, see or smell very well because everything in her head is misaligned, but otherwise shes totally normal, said Heather.She is very devoted and loyal to her family. She thinks shes a lap dog and always insists on sitting on my lap.All of the other dogs move out of the way for her, everyone has accepted that she gets special attention because our bond is so tight.Other mainstays at Mutt Misfits include Scary Jack, who owes his unusual appearance to a severe case of puppy strangles.Heather said: The charity was formed because in shelter settings there arent many organisations that specialise in the special needs pups.Most rescue groups take in highly adoptable pups from shelters and re-home them.

Just  days before Brexit, the PM has tabled a motion asking MPs to reiterate the support for her strategy that they expressed two weeks ago. But she faces defeat. And meanwhile MPs are tabling three amendments which would give them a chance to back a radically dferent approach instead. Its a re-run of two weeks ago, when MPs voted to reject the prospect of No Deal , and agreed to back the dealthe Irish border backstop can be fixed. The House of Commons showdown was originally billed a Valentines Day massacre where MPs could strip out core details of her plan for leaving the EU. Then it appeared MPs had backed off - in full knowledge that therell be another clash in two weeks from now. But she now faces a suprise defeat at the hands of Tory Brexiteers...  Heres how today works. Theresa May tables a statement. MPs then table amendments to it. Usually the amendments are the danger area. But Tory Brexiteers arent actually exercised about the amendments to her statement. Instead theyre cross about the statement itself - even though it has no legal force. It says: That this House reiterates its support for the approach to leaving the EU expressed by this House on  January . The problem is, the Commons agreed two things on January . One was to renegotiate the Irish backstop - a clause which could extend EU customs rules over the UK. Brexiteers are fine with this. The second was to reject the prospect of a No Deal Brexit. Brexiteers are not fine with this at all. Defeat on this motion wont have any legal force. But it will kneecap Theresa May in her talks with the EU, because it will show she doesnt have a united parliament behind her. Here are the  amendments she faces  Stop Tories running down the clock  Labours Jeremy Corbyn has an amendment that would stop the Prime Minister running down the clock. The bid would force the government to hold a full meaningful vote on the new Brexit deal by February  - or admit there is no longer a deal. If the government admitted there was no longer a deal, it would need to make a new statement on what happens next. It comes after ministers admitted MPs may only get their final meaningful vote a few days before the March  date of Brexit. Labour MPs fear that will blackmail them into choosing either Theresa Mays deal or a disastrous No Deal Brexit .  Delay the date of Brexit The SNPs Ian Blackford is seeking to extend the date of Brexit by no fewer than three months. This would have to be agreed with the EU, with whom extension talks would begin immediately.  Reveal secret No Deal briefing documents  Cross-party Remainers including Anna Soubry want to reveal the impact of no deal. Their amendment would instruct the government to publish the most recent official briefing document given to the Cabinet on the implications of No Deal on business and trade. The document would have to be published within seven days. Heres the threat coming soon Force the PM to rule out No Deal   NOTE: This amendment is not being laid THIS week - itll only be put forward towards the end of February. Labour MP Yvette Cooper is leading a fresh bid to rule out No Deal Brexit - after her previous attempt was defeated by MPs. Under her plan,there is still no Brexit deal by March , Prime Minister Theresa May must put no deal to a formal vote. MPs would then be able to vote to block a No Deal Brexit, choosing instead to extend the March  date of Brexit. Labours Brexit chief Sir Keir Starmer said the party will support Ms Cooper again, like they did two weeks ago. But hell have to convince some of the  Labour rebels who refused to back her last time to change their minds. A source said the amendment is being held back for now, because Tories clearly want one final opportunity to get a deal. “So it’s likely that it will be put to a vote at the end of the month, rather than now. At that stage, there are likely to be Tory resignations over it, the source said.  And here are the amendments that didnt make the cut The following amendments will not face a vote because they were not selected by Speaker John Bercow. Hold a ballot of MPs on the options  Remain-backing Tory grandee Ken Clarke is leading a bid for MPs to hold a vote on their preferences for the way forward. Under his plan, they would rank dferent options from  to X on a ballot paper - a highly unusual procedure. Any option could go on the ballot paperat least  MPs have backed it in advance. It comes days after the Tory MP was spotted having a curry with Commons Speaker John Bercow. We wouldnt possibly suggest the Speaker had something to say about this unusual ballot plan. Cancel the date of Brexit  SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is leading a bid to cancel the  March date of Brexit. His amendment calls on the government to urgently revoke the Article  notication, which set a two-year countdown to our leaving the EU back in . Under EU rules, Article  cant be extended without getting permission from all  EU leaders. But it can be revoked completely on the UKs decision alone. Delay the date of Brexit Labours Geraint Davies is seeking to extend the date of Brexit with the option of a future public vote. Let MPs vote on a series of set options Cross-party Remainers led by Sarah Wollaston, the Tory GP and MP, want to gold a series of indicative votes on the shape of a future deal. The options would be:Theresa Mays deal as it stands A No Deal Brexit Theresa Mays deal with backstop changes A Canada-style deal Norway plus, staying in EFTA A second EU referendumHold a second EU referendum  Labour MP Roger Godsf is leading a fresh bid to force a second EU referendum. Under his plan, the March  Brexit date would be delayed while a second referendum is arranged. The referendum would then have three questions on the ballot paper - Theresa Mays deal, No Deal, or stay in the EU. The referendum would use the alternative vote system, where the least popular option is eliminated and second preferences are then re-allocated to decide the winner. Plaid Cymrus Jonathan Edwards is also leading a bid to hold a binding second referendum on EU membership. And Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable wants to delay the date of Brexit in order to hold a second EU referendum.

Ex-city worker Catherine Blaiklock moaned emergency handouts are full of “sweet custard and PopTarts” and people “cannot even be bothered to buy their hungry children an egg.The former UKIP candidate was named last week as the leader of the Brexit Party, which is supported by Nigel Farage and claims to have gained , supporters in its first  hours.Ms Blaiklock, who owns a guest house in Norfolk, made the comments last month in an article for The Conservative Woman website. She complained about the “contradiction” between stories of people going hungry and an obesity epidemic   In the article, titled Let them eat spuds, she claimed nutritious food in the UK is very cheap and available in vast quantities, but many people lead chaotic lives or cannot cook. She added: A visit to a food bank of the type that millions are supposed to rely on shows you the problem. It is full of cans of sweet custard and packets of PopTarts and the like. They do not stock raw potatoes because they might ‘go off’. She added: Food banks should stop, think and go back to the drawing board. Kind as they may be, they are not doing society or their beneficiaries any favours. They are creating a dependent, obese population. Teaching their recipients how to shop for raw ingredients and to cook ‘meat and two veg’ would be more helpful.  Margaret Greenwood, Labours Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: These comments are distasteful and show just how out of touch this party really is. A Trussell Trust spokeswoman said the average user of the foodbank charity came just twice a year. Many foodbanks in our network do offer fresh food where they are able to safely store, a spokeswoman said. For example, fruit, vegetables, eggs and bread, and this is something we’re working with our network to develop further. Asked for comment by the Mirror, Ms Blaiklock said she was comparing the price of food in Nepal and the UK after living there and marrying a Nepalese man.  She added: [Anti-poverty campaigner] Jack Munroe has said exactly the same thing about simple basic cooking and was not criticised. Jamie Oliver has also said similar things. It comes after BuzzFeed News revealed earlier this week that Ms Blaiklock had made anti-Muslim comments in online articles. In one blog post about burqas she wrote: There are currently  majority Muslim countries in the world. If these people really dislike it so much in the West, why do they chose to live here  In another article she wrote: There is also some truth in the statement that Muslim men were impregnating white British girls to create Muslim babies”.

With  days left before Brexit, the Hansard Society says just  of  expected Statutory Instruments have been laid. They are crucial technical laws that ensure our legal system doesnt collapse on March there is No Deal. One of the SIs alone is  pages long and weighs several kilogrammes.   Ms Leadsom said around three SIs per day will be debated per day on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday after MPs were ordered back from their February break. Others will be pushed through behind the scenes. But there will be none in the Commons chamber on Thursday - with MPs instead having a general debate on trade agreements with the US, New Zealand and Australia that dont yet exist.Ms Leadsom joked:Labour is red.   Tories are blue.Our future is bright with a good deal in sight   For the UK and our friends in the EU. But SNP MP Pete Wishart fumed: They’re all going to be missing their skiing holidays and villas for this There’s only  days before we’re supposed to leave the EU. This is getting beyond a joke and this government is taking this House for mugs. Shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said: This is really serious. Each week there is chaos. This is an appalling way to govern a country.  And Mr Wishart shot back: Labour is red   Tories are blue   The message from Scotland is we’re staying in the EU! The Best For Britain campaign group, which opposes Brexit, claimed the government will need to lay seven SIs per day to meet its target. The group claimed , pages of SIs have been written. And with the average number of pages per SI in January being , over  SIs that means there are still , pages to be written, Best For Britain claimed.

The Shadow Chancellor called for the direct action as he claimed it is now unchallengeable that the system can be linked to peoples deaths - and many MPs still dont get it.He spoke to dozens of disability activists who met in Parliament yesterday to debate flaws in disability assessments and Universal Credit .In a wide-ranging speech John McDonnell told attendees all-in-one benefit Universal Credit was inflicting brutality and also criticised sanctions and disability benefit assessments. He said the PIP process, ESA process is pushing people to the edge. He called on those affected to confront their MPs in person. When theres a general debate, they dont seem to get it, the Shadow Chancellor said.  But when its face to face, these are the numbers in your constituency, and by the way Id like to introduce you to someone whos been sanctioned, we begin at least to get some appreciation. Later in his speech, he added: I dont think theres any understanding of the urgency. People are dying. When you say people are dying, with the number of suicides, Liverpool University research, the stuff that was produced in the Lancet - , impacted upon, journalists never, never believe you when you say that. But when you actually then say well Ill give you a case, heres one that happened in our area that we know about, eventually theres a little bit of awareness.  A Liverpool University study in  found the work capability assessment programme for ESA was independently associated with an increase in suicides, self-reported mental health problems and anti-depressant prescribing. However, the NHS later said of the study: The study can only demonstrate associations between the data. We cannot say for sure that the WCAs were the direct cause of the mental health outcomes examined. A  study in BMJ Open said austerity was linked to , extra deaths in England. However, it appeared to attribute health and social care cuts rather than the benefits system. Asked to claryhe was saying welfare policies can be directly linked to peoples deaths, Mr McDonnell told the Mirror: Its not just me saying that, its academic research thats been undertaken over recent years. Its unchallengeable now. The Department for Work and Pensionshas previously repeatedly said benefit policies cannot be linked directly to deaths.  The meeting was called to discuss flaws in the disability benefit system but Universal Credit featured heavily too. Mr McDonnell accepted new DWP chief Amber Rudd is now arguing for reform - but warned it must not just be publicity stunts and press releases. He added: I dont want to comment on Esther McVey, but thank God shes gone. Mr McDonnell infamously quoted someone who had said they wanted to lynch the then-DWP minister in . He told the meeting: All those years of just asking her to produce the information... made people so angry. And some go over the top and I got into trouble for that, but there you are.  Disability activist Catherine Hale told the meeting disabled people become paralysed with dread about receiving a letter notying them of an assessment. And on Universal Credit she added: Everything about Universal Credit creates a hostile environment for disabled people. There is no redeeming feature of Universal Credit that makes it worth keeping and tweaking. Universal Credit must be scrapped. What about Universal Basic Income as an alternative  Activist Mark Harrison added: What we require is a scrapping of Universal Credit. Meanwhile John McArdle, of the Black Triangle campaign which collates what it calls welfare-related deaths, said: I dont think anybody reasonably can deny the direct link between the Work Capability Assessment and people dying in destitution and from suicide. The Secretary of State might deny that, but the members of this House of Parliament cant deny that.   Sanctions were also criticised at the meeting, where attendees were told there was no evidence they helped people back into work. Gill Thompson, whose brother David Clapsons death was highly publicised in , told the meeting: I do feel thathe hadnt been sanctioned, he might still be here. Shadow Minister for Disabled People Marsha De Cordova slammed the system as callous and mean, saying the Tories are still shamelessly in power despite the cruel sanctions regime. She told attendees the system is littered with errors, adding: They have created what has become a hostile environment.A Conservative Party spokesman said: “ Labour created ESA which was supposed to end the perverse incentives in the old Incapacity Benefit but instead introduced new ones.“Whereas we’ve introduced Universal Credit which is targeted towards those who need support. “As a result around  million disabled households will gain on average around pound more per month on Universal Credit, compared to the old system. “We’re spending more pound billion this year on benefits to support disabled people and those with health conditions.“ "},{"url":null,"title":"tory brexit truce brink collapsing","story":"NewsBrexit: Tory truce faces collapse as Theresa May braces for Valentines Day defeatTonights vote was meant to be a love-in - but Tory Brexiteers are furious that theyre being asked to back a motion that commits to avoiding no dealShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political EditorDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsTonights vote was tipped to be a love-in - but instead Theresa Mays negotiating mandate could be thrown into chaos \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tory truce over Brexit faces collapse as Theresa May faced a fresh bruising Commons defeat by her Brexiteers. Tonights vote was tipped to be a love-in after the Prime Minister begged for more time to negotiate her Brexit deal with the EU. But hardline MPs are furious at being forced to vote on her motion, which is legally powerless - but politically crucial. Because of the way Commons motions work, the Brexteers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, claim they will be locked into avoiding a No-Deal departurethey back Mrs May tonight. So they are expected to rebel - throwing the supposed mandate for Mrs Mays talks with Brussels back into chaos. Although she can carry on trying to negotiate with the EU, Brussels chiefs are less likely to give groundthey think Mrs May doesnt have a united Parliament behind her. Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned: I think that our European partners will be watching to see,they make those concessions, do they think that parliament would be likely then to pass that agreement  MPs will hold a series of non-binding votes from pm, another chance to have their say on the Prime Minister’s Brexit plans.   MPs will be asked to confirm they still back the approach to leaving the EU that was passed by a stormy Commons on January . MPs backed an amendment that forced Mrs May to try to renegotiate the Irish border backstop - a clause in the -page Brexit deal which would trap us under EU rules - with Brussels. But on the same day, they also passed one which ruled out crashing out without a Brexit deal. Several MPs in the hardline European Reform Group have warned Tory whips that they will not support the PM’s plan. Mark Francois, ERG vice-chair, said: “We cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no deal and removes our negotiating leverage in Brussels... It is madness.”  But the PM’s official spokesman said: “No-deal is an eventuality we wish to avoid, but one we continue to plan for. Does no-deal remain on the table  The answer is yes.” The latest showdown comes as European Council president Donald Tusk expressed frustration at a lack of progress. He tweeted: No news is not always good news. EU still waiting for concrete, realistic proposals from London on how to break #Brexitimpasse. Meanwhile, Government ministers were desperately back-pedalling over claims the PM was running down the clock to blackmail MPs with the threat of a no deal. Her top Brexit aide Olly Robbins was overheard in a Brussels bar claiming MPs would get a last-minute choice to back the PM’s Brexit plan - or delay Brexit day.   Mrs May dismissed his remarks as “something said by someone  overheard by someone  in a bar”. She added: “We want to leave with a deal. That is what we are working for.” Senior Tories scrambled to insist that Brexit would happen on time. Tory vice-chairman Chris Philp said: “What a civil servant might speculate in a bar after a few drinks is frankly not that important.” Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer accused the PM of brinkmanship - and warned of a “concerted” cross-party effort to get an extensionher deal fails. He threw the party’s weight behind a new version of Labour MP Yvette Cooper’s plan to delay Brexit.  MPs could also get a vote on an amendment by veteran Tory Ken Clarke to allow MPs to vote for their preferred Brexit outcome. More cross-party talks took place today with Sir Keir and Labour’s Jon Trickett meeting Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and de facto deputy PM David Lidington. Meanwhile Labour faced a new split over whether to swing behind a second EU referendum. Sir Keir was slapped down by the leadership after suggesting a general election - Labour’s preferred option - was no longer viable. He said a second referendum was the only “credible option” leftLabour’s favoured Brexit deal can’t be agreed.   Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell admitted to the Mirror it would now be “very dficult” to secure an election. The Shadow Chancellor said: If we can’t get our deal through Parliament, [we’ve] kept the option on the table of going back to the people in a public vote. Our preference is a general election, butthat’s not available to us, yeah, a People’s Vote. “At the moment it’s very dficult to seewe could a general election, we know that. So therefore, yes, maybewe can’t get our deal through Parliament, we’d go back to the people again. At a later event, Mr McDonnell added: “We are still in hope of a general election but it’s unlikely.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alesha macphail accused boys mum","story":"NewsAlesha MacPhail: Accused boys MUM reported him to police after six-year-olds murderThe accused boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, voluntarily spoke to officers shortly after the body of Alesha MacPhail was foundShareByPaul Rodger:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsAlesha MacPhail was aged six when she died \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mother of a -year-old boy accused of abducting and murdering Alesha MacPhail contacted police after the child’s body was found, a court has heard.

The accused was described as “confident” and “very co-operative” by PC McKellar and asked his mum to leave the room while he spoke to officers.  The court previously heard allegations from the accused that he had sex with Toni-Louise McLachlan, the girlfriend of Aleshas dad, and that she then planted the semen-filled condom as evidence to incriminate the teenager on trial.Ms McLachlan denied that that was the case.When asked by the accused’s brief how it felt to be accused of murder, Ms McLachlan said: “Horrible.“I don’t know how to take it. I’m sad, I’m angry, I’m full of emotions.” In a statement given to police, as a witness, the teen accused said he left his house in the middle of the night to buy cannabis resin and took a shower after ing home as he was “really stoned”.

He said he knew Mr MacPhail was in a relationship with a woman called Toni Louise McLachlan, but claimed he had never met Alesha, although he knew his dealer had a little girl. The accused said he walked through Skeoch Wood, between Rothesay and Ardbeg, to avoid police, and walked past the site of an abandoned school before heading to meet a dealer where he bought ‘pollen’ for pound. He told police he “liked taking showers” while high as it cooled him down, and said: “I take a shower when I’m stoned - baked”. A police officer, PC David Grant, recalled being called to the MacPhail household after Alesha was found to be missing.  He described the child’s gran, Angela King, as being “panicked” and blaming herself for leaving the key in the door. And he recalled being met by Alesha’s dad, Mr MacPhail, and his girlfriend, who was “very concerned and was crying.” PC Grant said Mr MacPhail appeared to be “in a daze” and was not responding fully to what he was saying, which he believed was as a result of concern for Alesha.  After the child’s body was found around am the officer was told about a kne being found on a beach opposite the MacPhail family home, near a bus shelter.

Harry met the current crop of national players and their head coach Eddie Jones at the event and Englands Rugby World Cup winning heroes - Jonny Wilkinson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jason Leonard. The night was in aid of Try for Change, an England rugby programme committed to supporting disadvantaged young people, and mental health charity the Jonny Wilkinson Foundation. After watching a video showing young men who had developed personally after playing rugby Harry, who was taking part in a question and answer session with England co-captain Dylan Hartley, described the benefits of sport.  The duke, who is patron of the Rugby Football Union, said: Sport has an amazing ability to bring people together, it doesnt matter what size, shape, background or beliefs that you have. He went on to say: In the world today where there is so much missing from community up and down this country I think rugby - and I may get a boo for this - not just Rugby Union but Rugby League as well...rugby as a sport has an amazing ability to change peoples lives.  Harry was in the royal box to watch Englands emphatic win against France in the Rugby Six Nations championship at the weekend. The duke has been a lelong rugby fan playing the sport at school until he was injured and among the cheering fans who watched England win the Rugby World Cup in . Most of the England squad declined the offer of champagne and wine when they first arrived despite this weekend being a rest period before their crunch game against Wales towards the end of February. England player Brad Shields chatted with Harry before the evening began with his teammates, and later spoke about supporting the charity night being staged in the grounds of Kensington Palace.   He said: I think its humbling and brings you down to earth a little bit to know youre in a pretty good position and to use that for good.

Debonair Dogs Canine Grooming Salon in Moreton, Merseyside, today issued a statement saying the clip had been investigated and the woman involved no longer worked there.In the footage, the woman grabs the dog and holds it by the scruff of its neck before repeatedly prodding it in the ribs, making it squirm and wriggle. There is one dog in the foreground, and another tied to a metal unit at the back of the room.   The female groomer walks up to the dog at the back of the room, unleashes it, and picks it up. Unable to get a grip on the struggling dog, she holds it with one arm, and shakes it, looking at it while she does so. The dog briefly stops struggling, and the girl continues to suspend it in the air, by the scruff of the neck. With her other hand, the girl tries to grab the dogs ribs and each time the dog struggles and tries to get away. The girl then grips the dog with both hands from behind, and walks over to the front of the room towards where the other dog is.   Debonair Dogs Canine Grooming Salon released a statement on the Facebook page yesterday evening, saying: As a recent video has come to light I would like to reassure all of our customers that the girl involved no longer works under our employment and has left to start her own business. I can assure you that all the Debonair Dogs team are huge animal lovers and we love nothing more than providing you and your pooches with the best care. The girl involved has been investigated as complaints have been brought to light by other members of staff which is why we had cameras put in place to seethere was any evidence to back these complaints up - which we managed to get.  But as this is a serious matter, steps needed to be taken before it could be taken any further. We really hope to continue pampering your pooches and maintaining a caring environment for them. Thanks, Debonair Dogs team. Speaking today, the manager of Debonair Dogs, who declined to give his name, confirmed the video was taken at the grooming salon. He also confirmed the woman left the salon of her own accord two weeks ago. He said: Theres a lot of people that are really upset.  The police, the RSPCA, have been involved. I dont really want to say anything until weve sorted things out with them. I can maybe say more at the end of the week. Most Facebook users who watched the clip were disgusted by the girls actions. Jayde Ann said: Omfg, I am fuming. Joanne Tebble commented: I hope shes been reported. Shouldnt be allowed near dogs. Sue Earnshaw wrote: How awful. Nasty nasty woman. Hope this is seen everywhere. Matt Sumner added: You never pick up a dog like this, its disgusting. If the dog is a nipper, its for the owners and the business to discuss and then use a muzzle. Not this. Others defended the woman, including Nicola Leanne Sayers who commented: I think she was literally just trying to get hold of the dog without getting bitten. I dont see her shaking the dog at all.

Brady demanded his locked briefcases be taken from his room at Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside and put into storage in the hours before he died in May . Police have tried and failed to get a search warrant to go through the serial killer’s possessions. Keith’s brother Alan has said there is a ‘desperate’ need to examine the killer’s s paperwork because he took the secret of the -year-old’s final resting place on Saddleworth Moor with him to the grave. But a district judge at Manchester Magistrates’ Court turned down a police application to search them after he died of cancer because the killer and Myra Hindley are dead there is no chance of a prosecution.   Detectives had argued they only learned about them when Brady passed away - but the court defeat and further legal advice persuaded them not to go to the High Court. A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said “The application [for a search warrant] was heard by a district judge on May , . Based on legal advice the force did not proceed to the High Court.” Officers also asked Robin Makin, Brady’s solicitor of  years who also controls his will, to let them inspect the briefcases and paperwork but he also refused. Brady was jailed for le in  and spent the next  years taunting his victims’ families, telling police he was ‘puzzled’ they never found Keith’s remains and in  even took officers on to the moor.   His accomplice Myra Hindley was also taken back to Saddleworth in the s when they discovered the remains of Pauline Reade - but never any trace of Keith. His brother Alan Bennett said: “There is a desperate need to look for anything that may help in the recovery of Keith’s body and there may be something in those cases. “My brother’s body still remains on the moor while all the other victims have been ed to their loved ones for a proper burial. There seems to be no compassion or thought for Keith or his family.” He added that he had correspondence with Brady while he was alive and the serial killer told him there were ‘instructions’ for him in his will. He has made a ‘personal plea’ to Mr Makin by email and letter but claims he has heard nothing.  Brady died, aged , from cancer and emphysema in Ashworth Hospital. Greater Manchester Police have said they will never close the case despite Brady’s death. Keith Bennett disappeared on the way to his grandmother’s house on June  . Hindley had lured him into her car and driven him to the Moors where he was murdered.

A witness said he saw her head was down to the left side and was twitching and she had foam in her mouth.Tests also revealed she was twice the legal drug-drive limit for cannabis, Stoke on Trent Live reports. Little Corey Rhodes was given first aid by witnesses at the scene but sadly he couldnt be saved and died shortly after arriving at the Royal Stoke University Hospital.Rebecca, fromFenton, died after undergoing emergency surgery in hospital a day later. Her six-year-old son Kyle Rhodes, who was also in the car, survived after being airlted to Sheffield. The -year-olds BMW had veered on to the other side of Uttoxeter Road, Draycott, before hitting the Mercedes Sprinter van as she made her way to Poundland in Uttoxeter. According to a witness, the driver of the van was on the phone to the emergency services who repeated I couldnt stop. Another, Craig Barks, claimed he saw the van lt up in the air following the impact.   In a statement, he said: I was travelling along Uttoxeter Road towards the A in a Citroen Picasso. I was driving behind a Mercedes Sprinter at mph. I heard an almighty bang and I saw the van in front of me lt up about four or five feet from the surface. I got out of the van and approached a silver car and saw a woman sat in the drivers seat. She appeared to be fitting as her head was down to the left side and was twitching and she had foam in her mouth. Witness Linda Woolliscroft was travelling in the same direction as Rebecca in her Land Rover when she heard a loud bang. In a statement read out at the hearing, she said: I saw a car approaching from behind, it was a silver car that I thought was going to overtake me. Then I heard an almighty bang and I wasnt sure what had caused the bang. I looked across and noticed there had been a crash. I parked my car on a grass verge, put my hazards on and went over to try to help. I noticed it was the silver car that was behind me moments before. I noticed there were two young children in the back of the car and the driver of the van was on the phone to the emergency services who repeated I couldnt stop. I went over to the BMW and one man was trying to assess those in the car. I noticed the young boys in the back and they started CPR on Corey.  The inquest heard it is not known whether Rebecca suffered a fit before the crash or as a result of the accident. But her long-term partner James Rhodes revealed that while visiting his surviving son in hospital, Kyle told him Rebecca had suffered a fit. He said: As soon as I walked through the door, the first thing he said to me was mums had a fit and that she had no hands on the steering wheel. He would have seen Becky having fits before and he knows what one is. James added: She started to suffer some more regular fits about eight months before she died in the early part of last year. When I was at work the kids would tell me she had a fit and they were around once every three months. On the one occasion she had three fits in one day. Her medication was increased and she still had fits. She took her medication but sometimes shed miss it. Becky didnt use any illegal drugs apart from having around three cannabis cigarettes a night when the kids had gone to bed. Corey was in reception and was a happy-go-lucky child. Kyle would always wear his seat belt, but Corey from time to time would put part of the belt behind his neck. Corey and Kyle could be a distraction in the carthey were fighting as five and six-year-old brothers do.  Collision investigator PC Roger Wetton said that there was no evidence that Rebecca had informed the DVLA about her epilpesy. PC Wetton said: The BMW drove along the central hatch marks into the lane of the Mercedes. The van driver didnt see it as a problem until he had insufficient time to. A collision occurred between the front of both vehicles, both rotated in an anti-clockwise direction. Witnesses say the driver appeared to be having a fit. Her condition was not disclosed to the DVLA, which would have resulted in her licence being removed. PC Wetton added both Kyle and Corey were not in child booster seats. He said: Neither child had a hard seat and Corey was not wearing his seatbelt properly which could have protected him from hitting the rear of the front seat. Assistant Coroner for North Staffordshire David James recorded that both Rebecca and Corey died from multiple injuries as a result of a road traffic collision.

Georgina Paraskevas said she was left looking like a monster after having an allergic reaction to what she said was Clairols Nice N Easy product last November. The -year-old claims the dye left her blind for two days and with a scorched scalp. Georgina, from Bristol, believes the reaction was to Paraphenylenediamine- a chemical commonly found in dark hair dyes. The online jewellery store owner is now speaking out about her terrying experience to ensure other people know of the potential risks and are aware of alternatives.  It was honestly the most horric experience of my le, Georgina said. Looking back at the pictures now is just horrible, my head doubled in size and I looked like a monster. It felt horrible and made me feel like I had zero confidence. I hated going out and felt really self-conscious and like people were staring at me. I made the conscious decision to stay inside as I hated going outside and feeling like people were looking at me, it was awful. Georgina was refreshing her hair colour using the Clairol black hair dye on November th - a product shed previously used with no problem - and claims her face and scalp suffered no adverse reaction.  However the following evening during a romantic meal with partner Josh Cox, , she said her head began to feel really hot and itchy. Over the next two days her face slowly started to balloon so panicked Georgina rang  where an operator advised taking an antihistamine to combat the swelling. After visiting her GP the following day and receiving cream to soothe her scorched and blistered skin her face continued to swell so much so her eyelids closed over leaving her unable to see. Georginas desperate mum bakery worker June Kellett, , rang for an ambulance on and was rushed to Southmead Hospital where she was hooked up to a drip. Georgina said: My whole family use Nice N Easy and Ive used it a few times before with no problems. That evening my head was absolutely fine but it was when I went out in the evening the following day my whole head was hot and seriously itchy.  I had blisters on my scalp and the skin on my hairline was really crispy. Later that week the swelling got worse and when my eyes started to swell up and I couldnt open them, thats when I felt really panicked. When I went to the hospital it felt like I had glass in my eyes and I went full-on blind. I couldnt see a thing for two days, it was horrible.  After being discharged from hospital with a antihistamine and steroid prescription, Georgina had to be cared for by her mum and partner as her vision was still affected for a few days. Three months on Georgina now avoids chemical hair dyes and uses coffee granules to tint her brunette locks. Georgina said: Ive started using natural remedies on my hair now and use coffee granules to colour it, it works really well. I want people to be aware that things like this can and do actually happen. A lot of people dont realise whats in hair dye and that it can be really dangerous, Im really lucky and super grateful that it didnt escalate. Since this happened Ive read up on it and I could have permanently lost my eyesight and its scary to see that people have died from it.  Im also a lot more cautious about the things I use on my skin and I just make sure I read everything and make sure it contains natural ingredients. A Clairol spokesperson said: The safety of the people who use our products is our first and most important priority, so we were very concerned to hear about Ms Paraskevas experience with Nicen Easy No Ammonia when we were first made aware of the incident last November. Unfortunately we were unable to get in touch with Ms Paraskeva at the time. Allergic reactions are very rare and hair colourants are extensively researched to ensure they are safe when used as directed and it is imperative patch tests are conducted at least  hours before each colouring occasion. Details of how to perform this test are included with each of our products to help minimise risk to consumers. We remain happy to discuss the matter with Ms Paraskeva should she wish to contact us on our customer helpline.

But according to a womens heath expert, we should all be focusing on something much more important than roses, date nights and sexy underwear this year. Stephanie Taylor, managing director ofKegel, is trying to get women looking after their own intimate areas. She says: Every woman dreams of being treated like a goddess on Valentines Day. Yet, many of us are guilty of not looking after number one…our vaginas. The happiness and health of your intimate body parts should be high up on your list of priorities all year around, just like looking after your skin, hair and nails.   To help woman look after their vaginas, Stephanie has shared a list of  tips she claims every woman should follow. . Save, dont shave While some women may feel cleaner, more comfortable or even sexier when they shave, pubic hair does serve a purpose.It protects from bacteria and infections such asFolliculitis, absorbs sweat and acts as a buffer against friction. A recent survey found  per cent of woman shave down there, and  per cent getting rid of everything - so this is something lots of people need to focus on. . Stay balanced You might not know it, but vaginas are actually self-cleaning thanks to good bacteria known asLactobacilli. Using perfumed shower gels, bubble baths, moisturisers and wipes can upset your carefully balanced pH levels, potentially leaving you withuncomfortablethrushorbacterial vaginosis. So, next time you’re in the supermarket, opt for a perfume-free or sensitive products.   . Brief encounters Stephanies next tip involved that cheeky underwear set youve bought for your other half... Sexy underwear and Valentine’s Day go hand in hand but the last thing you want is your fun ruined by a Urinary Tract Infection. When it comes to pelvic health, some underwear is better for you than others. Typically, thongs are tight-fitting and sit close to the skin, moving back and forth throughout the day which can contribute to a UTI. No matter what underwear you prefer, always opt for cotton, which is the most breathable fabric, helping to keep moisture at bay. . Hello hydration We all know drinking lots of water is important, but did you know its vital for a healthy vagina  Stephanie explains: Hitting the daily recommended HO level can be a struggle, butthe promise of glowing skin and more energy doesnt incentivise you, maybe your vagina might.  If youre dehydrated, the drier youll be down there, which could lead to issues like an infection, itching or burning. Depending on how active you are, you should aim to drink between two and three litres of water a day.If the thought of tap water bores you, jazz it up with citrus fruits, cucumber and mint. . The Golden Rule Stephanie has one Golden Rule when it comes to keeping things happy down there. She says: While there are many sex myths, you should believe this one…peeing after sex. That’s because clearing your bladder instantly flushes out any bacteria in your vagina and urinary tract, cutting your risk of getting a UTI. You may not feel the sensation to go immediately after, but dont worry, as long as its done within a reasonable amount of time you can relax. . Change after the gym According to Stephanie, staying in your gym clothes after your work out is a sin.   She says: The thought of brunch after a sweaty workout might be a great motivator but staying in your gym clothes for too long is a sin. Sweaty clothes and underwear create the perfect breeding ground for bad bacteria, particularlythey’re tight and made from latex or polyester. So, have a quick shower and put on fresh clothes before you get on with the rest of your day. . Work your pelvic floor Pelvic floor weakness is often thought of as an old woman problem but the truth is it can affect any woman at any point in her le. If you ignore your pelvic floor, you could end up with bladder incontinence, prolapse or a loss of sensation during sex.  Pelvic floor exercises should be part of your daily routine andyou need an extra helping hand, try a pelvic toner which uses electrical impulses to stimulate those all-important muscles. . Get to know your flow Stephanies final tip is an important one, and its all about your periods.She says: Periods arent always predictable. If you often find yourself caught short or waiting and waiting, download a fertility tracking app to help you keep tabs on your cycle. When your flow does start itll be at its heaviest for the first day or two.Make sure to change your pad frequentlyand opt for a thicker night-time towel. If you prefer tampons, always use the smallest size you can and never leave one in longer than eight hours to avoid putting yourself at risk ofToxic Shock Syndrome .

Taking to Reddit, the unnamed bride shared her side of the story, asking fellow usersshe was an a**hole for not including her friend in the wedding party.She began the post by explaining that shed been friends with two women, Kristy and Erin, since they were all very young. The woman claims she and Erin had grown apart a little, and that she was now closer to Kristy, but soon reveals this isnt the reason she didnt ask Erin to be her bridesmaid. [Kristy] told me that Erins feelings were hurt and then asked me why I didnt include Erin, and I told her the truth.   Erin has MASSIVE breasts. Literally bigger than should be physiologically possible because she has a hormone disorder that caused her breasts to grow to an excessive degree. The bride goes on to explain that initially she had wanted Erin to be a bridesmaid, but thinking about the logistics of getting a dress tailored to fit her friends dimensions had stressed her out. But her bigger worry was being upstaged on her big day by her friends breasts. She continued: Part of me has a fear that Erins presence would be a distraction.   Ive been Erins friend since we were kids. Ive been there through it all, and I have seen how people react to her situation. When people think back on my wedding, I want them to think about how beautul the venue was, or how nice the wedding party looked, ormy fianceacute and I finally getting hitched! I dont want people to remember my wedding for the bridesmaid with the giant boobs. The woman added: I told Kristy these feelings and she more or less told me I was being an a**hole. And honestly I recognize that she might be correct, because Im being selfish... but then I also think thatever theres a time I can be a little selfish then its probably my wedding day.   People who read the post were less than impressed by the brides decision - and were quick to tell her so. One person agreed she was being an a**hole. They said: You specically didnt include someone in your wedding party for a medical problem they cant control. Trade out the issue at hand with needs a wheelchair or has a prosthetic arm and youll see the clear issue.  Another commented: The best way to handle the one bridesmaid needs a dferent sort of dress is to not do matching dresses but instead matching colours. A third added: I would be so hurtsomeone I knew from childhood decided not to include me because I was too skinny or because I had dferent coloured hair or because I had a certain sized breast. After reading all the responses, the bride updated her post admitting she failed to fully comprehend the depth of [her] a**holery. She has promised to sit down with Erin, apologise to her and do whatever she can to recty the situation.

Noahs whole body is engulfed by the sac but he still wiggles and attempts to cry as he is pulled from his mothers body. The sac usually splits just before birth and is more commonly known as a womans waters breaking. His -year-old mother told reporters at the Praia da Costa Hospital in the city of Vila Velha: People all around the world are reposting the photos and looking for us. I saw him being born. They lowered the screen so I could see. I cried a lot. Its an emotion that has no size.

Zaharie Ahmad Shah or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid stole the plane in what he termed a criminal event.The fateful flight took off from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March ,  but vanished without a trace with  crew and passengers on board.Vance, formerly of the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, told CBC News: It’s not an accident. This was planned and conducted, carried out by one inidual who had control of the aeroplane via his job to have control of the plane. He claimed that the pilot or co-pilot made the decision to take it to a remote part of the ocean and make it disappear forever.   After studying the crash debris, Vance claims the sections of the flap system were positioned downwards and that the plane entered the water at a low speed. He said: I believe with  percent certainty that the aeroplane entered the water in a controlled ditching with the flaps extended. This indicates the pilot had deliberately crashed the aircraft into the sea, he claims. We would call that a controlling ditching into the water, Vance told  Minutes Australia in an interview. The only way that could happen issomeone was flying the aeroplane. In particular,somebody selected the flaps to be in the extended position.  He added: If the flaps were down, then somebody would have had to have put them down, and they had to have put them down intentionally. Vance has put forward the theory in his book MH Mystery Solved which he spent  months researching. The investigator was not part of the official investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau Bureau but teaches the details of the incident to students.   Vances theory has not been universally accepted by those connected to the case. Martin Dolan, former head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, there was not enough evidence to support a murder-suicide conclusion - adding that it was speculation that the flap system was positioned downwards. The evidence is not yet sufficient to draw as firm a conclusion as you appear to have done, he told Minutes.  MHs disappearance has resulted in numerous theories as to its eventual fate, including some which say the plane was switched on autopilot and ran out of fuel.Indonesian fisherman Rusli Khusmin, , claims his crew witnessed the disaster while on an expedition off the coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia.He stated that the stricken plane emitted black smoke as it plunged into the Straight of Malacca in .  Speaking at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur, he said: I saw the plane moving from left to right like a broken kite. There was no noise, just black smoke as a result of fires before it crashed into the water. He swore an oath on the Koran and handed over evidence supporting his claims, including a a GPS navigator which he used to record the coordinates of the spot where he believes tyhe pane went down.

Being on the pitch it certainly felt it could have been a lot more than - at the break.“We dominated the game and that gives you a bit of confidence, especially playing against a Premiership team.“Second half we knew St Mirren were going to come out and have a bit more about them.“They did, but we were dealing with it without any real problems.“Unfortunately for us, Calum Butcher got sent off when it was a - tackle in midfield and could have just been a yellow card.“But he got sent off and then we showed the character to stick in and win the game.“We were playing against a team from the level above us for about  minutes with  men.

They’ve got something like  full-time clubs within a three-hour drive of where they’ve grown up,” he said.“When I was growing up in Adelaide, we had one team and then it was a two-hour flight to the next closest.“Soyou weren’t good enough for that team, you had to work harder and be prepared to sht around.“I know boys here who only want to play for teams in or near Edinburgh – and they can.“Scottish boys are very lucky to have so many clubs and opportunities without having to move.”While he’s no regrets about his nomadic career, McGowan admits the chance to hang around in one place for a prolonged period is growing more attractive.Particularlythat place is here in Scotland, the country he regards as his adopted home.“I do sometimes think I’d love to sign a two or three-year contract somewhere again,” he added.“I would have probably have loved to have stayed on at Hearts for a couple of more seasons and I was enjoying my time at United when I was there but bids came in and were accepted.“And having an Australian passport does open doors in Asia, which is why I’ve ended up there a few times.”If the chance arises to stay at Dundee long-term, he admits it’s something he will give serious thought.He has not, and will not, look that far ahead until he’s helped the Dark Blues out of their current predicament.“A couple of weeks ago moving to Dundee hadn’t even come onto my horizon. Everything has happened quickly and I just want to make sure that, first and foremost, we stay in this league.“When the summer comes,an opportunity arises to stay I will definitely consider it but there is a lot of work to be done between now and then.”He is confident by the end of the season Dundee will be safe.“It’s been really good so far. They are a great bunch of boys and they have made me feel really welcome in the dressing-room.“I’ve kicked most of them when I was playing here in seasons gone by so I know most of them.“There’s a good manager in Jim McIntyre to work under as well. I’m showing my age here but I’ve actually played against him when I was a young player on loan at Ayr from Hearts.“He was coming to the end of his career then and later I played against a couple of his teams once he’d become a manager.“I’m quite close with a couple of players who have played under him and they spoke highly of him and that was more of a factor in coming here.“Having played across the road I also knew how big a club Dundee is.

thumping of Dundee back in October – Livi’s form has slipped off a clf with last Wednesday’s - draw at Hearts bringing a five-game losing streak to an end.Since leaving Dundee gaffer Jim in no doubt how big a job he had on his hands with that - success at the Tony Macaroni Arena, Gary Holt’s side have only picked up three victories and none since the middle of December.That’s seen them slip from a high of second spot with  points from their first eight games down to ninth with just  picked up from the following  matches.And, though the gap between the sides hasn’t shrunk in those four months, the feeling around both clubs right now couldn’t be more dferent.A massive part of that from Dundee’s point of view is the complete overhaul of the playing squad in the winter transfer window.In fact, there’s a fair chance there won’t be any of the players who featured in the - defeat the last time the Dark Blues travelled to West Lothian this time around.Only three of the  used by Jim that day remain at the club – Elliott Parish, Cammy Kerr and Kenny Miller.Of those, only Miller looks like he could be given a start this time around but even he has a fair bit of competition to overcome with Andrew Nelson on the goal trail and Craig Curran preferred by the manager to lead the line in every match since he arrived at the club at the start of January.A missed penalty in stoppage time in their last run-out won’t have helped veteran Miller’s cause either.Meanwhile, Parish hasn’t featured since that - thumping and doesn’t look like dislodging Seny Dieng as first choice any time soon.The nature of the goals that day, with all four from set-pieces, no doubt led the manager to question his defenders.Parish quickly paid the price by dropping to the bench while three of the back four have been moved on.Andy Boyle is now at Ross County, Ryan Inniss was sent back to Crystal Palace after a nightmare at Palmerston in the Scottish Cup and Calvin Miller has also dropped to the Championship, being picked up by Ayr United on loan from Celtic.Kerr was right-back in October but he’s seen his place taken by new signing James Horsfield in recent games.The former Manchester City kid has looked assured in Kerr’s place and will take some shting before Saturday.The rest of the team have since been shown the exit door – Glen Kamara, Kharl Madianga, Lewis Spence, Sofien Moussa, Benjy Kallman, Roarie Deacon and Adil Nabi have all moved on.Even the side that drew -

He’d done his homework and, equally importantly, worked out exactly where his squad needed strengthening.That means the right players for the right positions have been found, or so it seems.That’s produced victories over Morton and St Mirren that have lted spirits among Arabs. Rightly so, because both outings have seen impressive work.Of course, with most of those brought in lacking match fitness – that’s usually the major issue with January signings – the good football, has mostly come in the first hour.Players who’ve not had a lot of game time have tired, particularly when reduced to  men at St Mirren. They’ve then shown their ability to manage matches.What the manager also looks to have done well is identy those already in his squad who were good enough to be part of his plans.For all new boys like Peter Pawlett, Mark Reynolds and Mark Connolly have deserved the praise they’ve received for their first couple of performances, attackers Pavol Safranko and Nicky Clark have shown they remain big players.After a run of just two goals in nine games, Safranko has found his scoring touch with one in each of the last two outings and has looked the lethal striker he did when he first arrived on loan from Aalborg.Now he’s finally got fully fit, Clark also looks dangerous and there’s no doubt both have benefited from having better players round them in the last two outings.For Neilson and his players the trick is now to keep the good work going. The good news for United fans is, this time, that might just happen."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"scrapping-glasgow-airport-rail-link-is-lack-of-ambition-says-mp","story":"GLASGOW must show more ambition to grow the rail network to accommodate more passengers and new services a city MP has said."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-pollok-country-park-plans-to-become-more-cycle-friendly","story":"VISITORS to Pollok Country Park are expected to triple when the Burrell Collection reopens at the end of next year."},{"url":null,"title":"dippy-in-glasgow-clarkston-chiropractic-get-on-board","story":"Wersquore going to need a bigger tablehellip"},{"url":null,"title":"lgbt-history-month-council-decision-not-to-fly-pride-flag-is-slammed","story":"A COUNCILLOR has slammed the decision not to fly the Rainbow Flag on Glasgow City Chambers during LGBT History Month."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-mcdonalds-branch-is-serving-up-side-of-classical-music-with-big-macs","story":"A GLASGOW branch of McDonaldrsquos is serving up a side of Bach with its Big Macs in a bid to reduce anti-social behaviour."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potato-day-back-at-the-reidvale-centre","story":"ITS a favourite day in the allotment calendar and the Glasgow Potato Day willthis year."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-reveals-kieran-tierney-wont-make-valencia-game","story":"Tomorrow nights Europa League game against Valencia will come too soon for Kieran Tierney."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-tells-celtic-to-believe-ahead-of-valencia-tie","story":"As tests go, there will be an examination this evening at Celtic Park that will be far more intense than anything  Brendan Rodgersrsquo side have experienced since the turn of the year."},{"url":null,"title":"student-party-flat-in-glasgow-city-centre-allowed-to-keep-licence","story":"THE LANDLORD of a student flat which neighbours claim is an intolerable party zone has been granted a new licence."},{"url":null,"title":"savoy-centre-revamp-art-and-culture-drawing-in-new-generation-of-customers-into-iconic-mall","story":"A PLAN to breathe new le into Glasgows Savoy Centre with boutique stores, cafe bars and contemporary art is drawing in a new generation of customers, according to traders as the next phase of the project is launched."},{"url":null,"title":"10-of-the-most-embarrassing-things-peoples-toddlers-have-said-in-public","story":"KIDS, famously, say the funniest things ndash but sometimes they can leave their parents in thoroughly awkward situations."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-trampoline-park-flip-out-announce-free-entry-for-a-year-giveaway","story":"Trampoline enthusiasts could be jumping for joy after a Glasgow arena announced it has opened applications to bring in ambassadors -

Exodus, the third game in the series inspired by Dmitry Glukhovsky#strilogy, takes Artyom out of the from the tunnels he calls home and out to discover what happened to the rest of the world outside of the Russian capital.With small band of Spartans,Exodus will take you on-board the Aurora as you seek to explore what#s happened to the rest of your country following the nuclear war that devastated the world  years earlier.No corner of the country you explore is untouched by the devastation of the war, with small bands of civilians struggling to make a le in the countryside controlled by mutated creatures, disfigured monsters and violent bandits holding up in the ruins of Civilization.So it#s time to dust off your gas mask, grab your geiger counter and head back into post-apocalyptic wildlands # and as the Russians say, Удачи.  Exodus moves away from the claustrophobic, cramped confines of Moscow#s underground and instead takes you out in the wilds of post-apocalypic Russia.The Aurora # an armoured steam train # serves as your semi-mobile base as you move through the countryside battling to survive. Every stop of the train not only helps progress the story, but also acts as a central hub for exploration of the inidual zones you come across.These large zones feel much bigger than anything previously seen in agame, the well-crafted, well-designed environments are dferent and enticing, populated with a mix of radioactive mutants, ferocious wildle, unforgiving radiation zones, crazy civilians and vicious bandits. Players are able # and actively encouraged # to explore the zones in depth with smaller optional side quests giving an added reason to explore the far corners of the map.Hidden throughout each of the zones are small secure bases which act as a home away from the train, with workbench for crafting and bed to progress the day night cycle which can change the flow of a mission.As you progress through the game, set over the course of an entire calendar year, the seasons and environments change, moving from winter to spring and beyond, with the dynamic weather adding an extra challenge as you battle through blizzards, thunderstorms and mist.Other locations in the wilderness include small villages, bandit camps and ruined bunkers full of Humanimals and other beasts. Whether you choose to attack these at day or night can have a fundamental affect in the way you approach them. Typically there#s more mutants around at night, but you have the added benefit of being able to hide in the shadow#s easier.The design ofExodus means there#s a real choice between taking an area by stealth, slowly but methodically taking out enemies quietly on your way, or going loud with gunfire and grenades to clear an encampment. Not only will the potential outcome change, with rescuing certain hostages allowing earlier access to some items, but your decisions are reflected in the games dialogue. vw, px\"  Evenyou do opt for a full all-out assault on a base, the designers have created the structures in such a way you can skulk in the shadows to plan your move. Regardless of how you approach it, exploration is key to providing vital crafting components to improve your guns, construct ammo and replenish your stocks of medkits.And while the radiation and toxic air is, for the most part gone, there#s still areas where the iconicgas mask is needed # and keeping it in good nick and stocked with filters is vital for those moments.It#s this crafting element that really allows you to personalise your experience ofExodus. Each weapon has countless dferent possible iations, with the ability to mody pretty much every every aspect of your gun and armour to suit your own play style.Crafting and exploration is key toExodus, here#s a few a spoiler-free tips from us. vw, px\"   Exodus builds upon the success of andLast Light, incorporating the key features while bringing a whole new element in the non-linear open world sections.The balance between making the game feel new and fresh, and very clearly still agame and continuing Artyom#s story is very well done. The five years A games spent making it have been very well used.The level design, use of day night cycles and weather has resulted in a very attractive game with clear elements designed to encourage exploration, but never shoe-horning you into a specic play style. vw, px\"  That great level design is accompanied by fantastic immersive audio which is never more apparent while your sneaking your way through the sewers dodging mutants, and staying out of flicking candlelight while you sneak up on a vigilant guard.For fans of the series this is going to be a must pick up follow-up when it launches later this week, for those new to the series i#m going to recommend picking up the remastered double pack first to familiarise yourself with the story.

First performed in , Within This Dust has gone on to be staged all over the UK and internationally, including at the   memorial and museum.Especially inspired by Richard Drew#s unforgettable photograph, The Falling Man, Within This Dust details the experience of witness, Lisa Hood, and victim, Vince Virr, of the   attacks.The witness finds herself surrounded in dust, made of crumpled paper, and begins a grieving process of hunting through the papers, finding meaning in the words, as someone tries to tidy around her. The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

The bunds will help reduce the risk of debris reaching the A in the event of a landslide.This project allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of recycling the material being excavated from the Rest and Be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works.To keep roadworkers and motorists safe throughout the works, temporary traffic lights will be in place on the A at each location. This next phase of the works is expected to last approximately  weeks.Commenting on the works, Eddie Ross, BEAR Scotland’s North West Representative said: #The installation of the next stages of the mitigation measures will provide more protection and resilience against any future landslips blocking this key route at both the Rest and Be Thankful and Glen Kinglas.#The temporary traffic lights are necessary to keep our teams as well as users of the route safe during the works, and the teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and safely as possible.#We encourage road users to plan their journeys in advance by checking the Traffic Scotland website for up to date travel information.#"},{"url":null,"title":"third sector interface launches new approach to service delivery","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Third Sector Interfaceis changing the way it supports all types of third sector organisations, including charities, social enterprises and community groups.Due to many people now finding information through digital means and the need for information and assistance to be accessible and consistent across the whole of Argyll and Bute, not just in the main towns, the organisation has launched a new website, argylltsi.org.The website, reflecting the TSI’s new corporate identity, contains a self-serve area allowing third sector organisations to find links to a whole iety of locally-based and more national resources that can support their development needs, as well as useful templates to use to run their organisations.The TSI will be growing and developing self-service over the coming months, with the site becoming a ‘one-stop shop’ for information that third sector organisations need to set up, govern and manage organisations – everything from how to start a social enterprise to raising funding from major donors.The TSI can also now be contacted through a central freephone number #   , available between the hours of am-pm, Monday-Friday.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Alan McConnell, , admitted the offence when he appeared in Ayr Sherf Court. McConnell was drinking at home with his partner on December  last year. But at some point he left the address, in Prestwick’s Raith Avenue, said depute fiscal Lindzi Bayne. His partner went looking for him at a nearby corner shop, but he had driven off so shop staff contacted police. McConnell’s car was traced to Drongan, and he admitted he had driven there. The charge against him stated he drove on roads between Raith Avenue, Prestwick and Coronation Road, Drongan. A breath test revealed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit in Scotland is  microgrammes. The court heard that McConnell had been ‘just over’ the limit in an earlier drink-driving conviction. Defence lawyer John Gallagher said his client was well aware he could be sent to jail this time. However, he made a plea for a sentence of unpaid work on his client, now of Lane Crescent, Drongan. Sherf John Montgomery told McConnell: “You were driving at five times over the prescribed limit. “If you ever offend again like this, it is inevitable you are going to jail.” He imposed a four-year-driving ban on McConnell, and ordered him to do  hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months. There was another crumb of comfort for McConnell when the sherf refused a Crown motion to seize his car, worth pound.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrCourtsAlcoholDrink-drivingJusticePrestwickAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"retired girvan bank boss admits","story":"NewsRetired Girvan bank boss admits drink-driving offencesNeighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsWilliam Fairbairn is disqualied from the roads for three years\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA retired bank manager was lucky not to be jailed after admitting two drink-driving offences. Neighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Sherf John Montgomery told him: “That would normally mean a custodial sentence. I note your previously unblemished record.” The sherf instead imposed a fine of pound on Fairbairn, and banned him from driving for three years. Depute fiscal Lynda Carnochan described how an anonymous person phoned police on Tuesday afternoon, August , , around .pm. An hour later, police traced a blue Audi car to Rodney Drive in Girvan, and Fairbairn was still in the vehicle. His speech was slurred, said Ms Carnochan. But due to health problems, he struggled to give a breath test.   However, a blood test revealed he had  milligrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of blood, when the legal limit is  milligrammes. Just two months later, on October , , police on mobile patrol saw Fairbairn driving a Vauxhall Corsa. “They were aware of anonymous reports that he was driving while drinking,” said Ms Carnochan. “They followed him into The Avenue, but he did not stop when police flashed lights at him. He then turned into Rodney Drive, and drove past his own address. However he was eventually stopped.” A breath test was this time successful on Fairbairn. And iot showed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath when the legal limit is  microgrammes. Solicitor Hugh Duncan said Fairbairn had retired from the Bank of Scotland in  on a pension of pound per week.   He used his car to visit his -year-old mother, who is resident in a care home, added the lawyer. “The second matter, within such a short space of time, shows there is an issue with alcohol,” Mr Duncan admitted. “His we tells me his drinking is being curtailed. He was hospitalised with a gallstone, and he suffers from COPD.” Sherf Montgomery fined Fairbairn pound on the first charge, with a  months disqualication. He added an pound fine and a three-year disqualication on the second charge. Fairbairn, of Rodney Drive in Girvan, agreed to pay the pound total within  days. His disqualications will run concurrently, making a total of three years, but the Crown made no move to seize the family cars.

The leave will support employees to attend medical appointments and counselling, attend legal proceedings, seek safe housing and visit support agencies. Ms Brennan-Whitefield, SNP member for Ayr North, said South Ayrshire was setting an example by implementing the policy. She told the Ayrshire Post : Domestic abuse can affect anyone at any time - it affects both men and women so this in inclusive regardless of gender or sexual orientation.I think that it was unanimously agreed at full council shows that this issue is now on peoples’ radar.

facing our systems.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said:ldquoAE waiting times are now at their worst level since records began, which is a damning indictment of years of austerity and wider

therersquos no bed.But she added: ldquoItrsquos not just about beds, we also need the nurses to safely staff them.A spokesman for the NHS said thousands more people have been successfully treated in AE within four hours than last year.This is because the total number of attendances has gone up year on year.He said an average , more people a day were assessed, treated and discharged or admitted from AE within four hours in January  compared with the same month in  ndash an increase of .%.For planned care, the NHS data shows that the proportion of people waiting more than  weeks for treatment is at its highest level for a decade.December figures show there were , people waiting more than  weeks for treatment.Some % of all patients should be treated within  weeks but this has not been met since February .The data also shows that it is more than three years since the NHS last met the target for patients urgently referred with cancer to start treatment within two months.The RCEM, which represents , emergency medicine clinicians, opposes NHS Englandrsquos plan to scrap the four-hour target.NHS England is currently reviewing its clinical targets including the requirement that % of all patients attending AE are treated, admitted or discharged within four hours.NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has said a new target willsee a shorter waiting time target for treating people with serious conditions such as stroke, heart attack and sepsis.People with less critical needs will need to wait longer.The RCEM has saidscrapping the four-hour target ldquowill have a

improvements to encourage new businesses to locate here and to promote tourism.We would like a larger Saab  or equivalent aircraft that can land in more adverse weather conditions # we understand the economies of scale and suggest a service that can fly to Campbeltown and then on to Islay, back to Campbeltown and ing to Glasgow, or vice versa.We would like the reinstatement of the radar system to assist landings in adverse weather conditions.As there is a separate service between Islay and Edinburgh we suggest that Campbeltown should be included as we also have key tourist attractions such as distilleries and three fantastic -hole golf courses and high-standard accommodation.We would like to see the service continue with a timetable with low ticket prices to allow the full day in Glasgow for NHS appointments, business and shopping trips and the reinstatement of seven days a week flights to enhance business and tourism.In addition, we want national advertising campaigns inclusive of timetables to promote the area for increased passenger numbers, including weekend breaks.These aspirations are very much in keeping with the council’s Community Plan Single Outcome Agreement   in

the most interesting came from Scotland.In the olden days, Candlemas was the day when children brought candles to school so that the classrooms would have light on dull days.As time went on, gas lighting took over from candlelight and the children brought money to school with which the teacher was supposed to buy sweets for the children.The child who brought in the most money was declared Candlemas King or Queen and they ruled for six weeks.They had the power to make one whole afternoon a week a playtime and to excuse anyone they wished from any form of punishment.I don#t think this will catch on in Argyll!I think it is a lovely custom to take a child to church or temple for a blessing and to give thanks to God for their birth.I have the privilege of being chaplain to two primary

It will also advise on any further, long-term solution to the issues at the beach.The groyne at the northern end of the beach will provide protection over part of the northern section of the seawall, with the potential to develop a higher beach in front of the wall.Finally, armour stones will be put in place along Lamer Street to protect the seawall.Discussions on how to revitalise the East Beach, which was once a popular tourist attraction, have been ongoing for more than five years.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, has been heavily involved in the talks to find a solution.She was hopeful the latest measure would help and told community councillors: ldquoThe rock breakwater, the design has been worked on for more than two years.ldquoIt is now the preferred design solution and is the subject of a planning application.ldquoThere has been a lot of chatter about the East Beach and I wanted you all to be aware of what is going on and to be able to speak with some authority.Stones weighing anywhere between three and six tonnes will be used as part of the project, with work expected to take place throughout the summer and into the autumn.Mrs Swan was expecting heavy machinery to be on the site and said: ldquoIt will require big machines, at least -tonne trucks, moving these rocks around.ldquoThe East Beach will be the site of quite a lot of activity over the summer and we are bound to get some negative comments.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

said:ldquoAE waiting times are now at their worst level since records began, which is a damning indictment of years of austerity and wider cuts imposed upon health and care services under the

show there were , people waiting more than  weeks for treatment.Some % of all patients should be treated within  weeks but this has not been met since February .The data also shows that it is more than three years since the NHS last met the target for patients urgently referred with cancer to start treatment within two months.The RCEM, which represents , emergency medicine clinicians, opposes NHS Englandrsquos plan to scrap the four-hour target.NHS England is currently reviewing its clinical targets including the requirement that % of all patients attending AE are treated, admitted or

He effectively dropped his opposition to her Withdrawal Agreement, which Labour had repeatedly condemned as the ldquoworst of all worlds. The Labour leaderrsquos letter still calls for a customs union, regulatory alignment on trade and guarantees on workers rights and security cooperation. But, crucially, Labour is no longer holding to the ldquosix tests, and insisting a Brexit deal should deliver ldquoexactly the same benefits as being in the single market.Labour has even dropped its opposition to the Irish backstop, which Mr Corbyn condemned, as recently as December, for leaving Britain ldquoin an indefinite halfway house with no say on its future. The explanatory note that Labour circulated after the leaderrsquos letter to May is quite clear. ldquoAny withdrawal agreement,\" it says, ldquowill need to include a backstop.\" Labour is also hinting at further compromises in ldquonegotiations.Hitherto, Labourrsquos policy has been to make demands May could never accept now they are trying to make her an offer she canrsquot refuse.So at last, after months of there being nothing much new to say about Brexit, suddenly we have what looks like a breakthrough, a historic compromise. Of course, you canrsquot overestimate the ability of political leaders to look a gt horse in the mouth. Theresa May may be so wedded to being a ldquobloody dficult womanthat she may find a way to avoid accepting Labourrsquos free hooved mammal. But the deal is there to be made.Senior Tories like Sir Oliver Letwin have welcomed the Labour offer, seeing it as a step towards a Norway-style agreement, even though it isnrsquot. Labourrsquos plan is much closer to Turkey, which is also in a customs union and accepts regulatory alignment. Brussels likes Corbyns proposals too, as a way out of hard Brexit ldquohell.Ive argued that the logic of Labourrsquos position was always to back something resembling Theresa Mayrsquos deal with the EU. It corresponds to Labourrsquos manesto commitments to leaving the EU, including the single market, and ending free movement while seeking frictionless trade. Mrs May has always supported regulatory alignment, since the ldquocommon rule book in her Chequers plan. And the backstop, remember, involves the UK remaining in the customs union until there is a future comprehensive trade deal.In what could almost have been a coordinated intervention last week, Mrs May restated in Dublin her determination to prevent a hard border in Ireland. This put the wind up the DUP, since they fear that the border might now move to the Irish Sea.It didnrsquot appeal to the hardline Brexiteers in her own party either, who are adamant that no deal is better than her bad deal. They thought it had been killed off by last monthrsquos record-breaking Commons defeat ndash but it may now live again with Labourrsquos backing.They canrsquot admit it, of course, but May and Corbyn are now speaking broadly the same language. The customs union, regulatory alignment, rights and protections etc are all matters to do with the future trade relationship with the EU, not the Withdrawal Agreement. It covers only money, citizenship and the Good Friday Agreement.The trading relationship can only be negotiated after Brexit. It is to be hammered out within the up to four years of the transition period, during which the UK remains in the single market and the customs union.Onlythere is no agreement does the backstop comes into play, and that really just extends the transition period indefinitely. May has said she will get assurances that the backstop will be time-limited, but she canrsquot get that from the European Union. If it was limited, it would no longer be a backstop.What hard Brexiteers really fear is that the transition period might lead to a soft Brexit, not a clean break ndash and they are right. What we know is that MPs will block any no-deal Brexit. Hardliners face a choice of May Corbyn or no Brexit at all.To secure a Commons majority without them, Mrs May could promise legislation to keep Britain in regulatory alignment with the customs union until a new trade deal is finalised ndash one which delivers the same benefits. This is anyway implicit in her promises to keep trade ldquofrictionless. Indeed, remaining in a customs union is the only way of achieving this. Up to now, she hasnrsquot been able to say this openly for fear of a rebellion by her hardline backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg. They want a managed no-deal now, or in four years, under the so-called ldquoMalthouse Plan.Butshe has an ounce of political sense, May will now face them down and pivot to Labourrsquos softish Brexit. Labourrsquos demand that she put the customs union in primary legislation can be finessed, because the trade negotiations canrsquot happen until after Brexit. She doesnrsquot even need to ensure that Labour votes with her. Labour could abstain in the meaningful vote and achieve essentially the same result. The DUP would accept the customs union as a guarantee against a backstop or an east west hard border.Jeremy Corbyn could explain Labourrsquos abstention, which will be attacked by Vote Leave MPs andleader writers, by saying, as his spokespeople did last week: that the top priority ldquofor the nation is to avoid a no-deal. Corbynite commentators can be relied upon to condemn any Labour MPs who continue to vote against Mayrsquos deal as traitors. Unreconstructed Blairites, voting with the hated Moggists to force a no-deal disaster.Corbynrsquos letter made no reference to a Peoples Vote. Remainers in the Labour Party realise where all this is heading, which is why a number, like former shadow cabinet figures like Owen Smith, and Clive Lewis, have threatened to leave the party. That could become part of the script.Corbyn has used the Brexit issue to smoke out Blairite Remainers like Chuka Umunna, and the Jewish MP, Luciana Berger, in order to portray them as disloyal splitters.Of course, ordinary members of the Labour Party will be mightily confused. Many of them still think Labour is committed to a referendum. It still could come to that, of course,May doesnrsquot seize this opportunity.I still harbour vague hopes that A could be revoked, but Irsquom afraid that pro-Europeans are on the wrong side of history right now. The country is destined to leave the EU, because letrsquos face it, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn is and has always been a pro-Brexit party.And after Brexit Day  Well, get ready for Groundhog Day  as negotiations over the future EU trade deal begin all over again."},{"url":null,"title":"london-based-oil-and-gas-independent-makes-progress-off-scotland","story":"Read more: RockRose hails exciting acquisitionRockrose said the production lives of the Ross and Blake fields north east of Aberdeen are being extended from  to at least  in a development that will allow the firm to book around . million barrels oil equivalentadditional reserves.News of the extensions will be studied with interest in the North Sea oil and gas industry amid the official drive to maximise the economic recovery of the UKrsquos oil and gas resources.RockRose has also made progress with plans to bring finds into development.It said yesterday that plans for the development of the Tain field are progressing and are expected to be submitted to the regulator this year.

I really wanted to do something with the song, so we used it in the trailer.ldquoThen after a while I started thinking the same kind of thoughts we had when we were making Whatever Gets You Through The Night, and that it would be a really interesting way to broaden out the festival beyond astronomy and star-gazing. Itrsquos about songs and stories which help you through that time in the night.Mr Eaton-Lewis added: ldquoWhen you come to Lewis people tell you the winters are long and hard because the nights are so long.ldquoBut the long nights can also be magical. A lot of the stories people were coming up with when we were first making that project were about endurance and survival. So it seemed like an interesting thing to explore in this context.The festival, which runs until  February , includes photography exhibitions, film screenings, expert discussion on the cosmos and insight into the inidual benefit of sensory enlightenment through exposure to the dark, with indoor and outdoor venues including the former RAF radar station at Gallan Head, the UKrsquos most north-westerly point.Glasgow-based singer songwriter Emma Pollock said the festivalrsquos appeal lay in its celebration of the winter experience.ldquoItrsquos so dferent to that of the summer on the island or the winter on the mainland, and I think for that reason itrsquos beautul idea, because so many of us just donrsquot get to experience that emptiness or that silence, said the former lead singer of Lanarkshire indie band The Delgados.ldquoThis is essentially a nod to the fact that the contrast between night and day in a rural community is much greater than you ever get living in the city.Ms Pollock will perform her song Dark Skies as part of her performance at An Lanntair, written for the  project as a reflection on growing up in Castle Douglas in Dumfries and Galloway close to the Galloway Forest, one of two Dark Skies Parks in Scotland - the other being in the Cairngorm National Park.She said: ldquoI was thrown back to where I grew up, that emptiness, that rural space which is so much more magnied at night and is such a huge contrast with urban darkness.ldquoIf yoursquore out there and the weather is good, then what you can see is quite incredible.

Work on building this is now well underway and initial connections to some of the buildings within the plan are set to go live later this year.The technology works by extracting heat from the water in a similar way to the technique used by a refrigerator to cool its contents.

Equally promising ndashperhaps even more unlikely ndash is its network of underground mineshafts and tunnels, long abandoned and now filled with huge amounts of water.Glasgow City Council is working with the British Geological Survey in looking at the possibilities of employing heat pump technology here too. It would help the city to meet government targets ensuring that  per cent of heat demand comes from renewable sources by .Modelling work has been carried out and in theory, it is possible that nearly half of the local demand for heat could be catered for in this way.This would confirm the area as a European leader in green energy innovation as well as major contribution to a low carbon environment.Glasgowrsquos proud industrial heritage of coal and river may now be firmly in the past. But itrsquos wonderfully fitting that it is being imaginatively reinvented to serve it ndash and the planet - well into the future.The Heraldrsquos Climate for Change initiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time. It is up to us to keep fighting. There is parking available in the town so the problem can be overcome.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But after holding the first AGM last week, the group now wants to go after larger projects through the lottery funding.The ultimate ambition is to renovate Dingwall Town Hall and ensure it is brought into regular and sustained use by locals and visitors as a focal point of the town.Before that, the DCDC directors and trustees, comprising Janet Bowen, Debbie Downie, Robin Lingard and Nigel Greenwood have been ldquosting through the communityrsquos suggestions for improvements to the town.Mrs Bowen said: ldquoDingwall is very fortunate to have a number of organisations which are dedicated to making the town an attractive and welcoming place.

Why can we tell this is happening  Simple, #because we are at last #seeing the symptoms of decay in its once strict internal discipline.SNP politicians briefing against each other, hostile opposition to official policy, histrionics about BBC bias as a deflection from what’s going wrong with the party’s strategy and policies – and now even the open talk of notNicola Sturgeon should go, but when and where to.I am not making this up. There is no conspiracy. You only need to have been reading, watching or listening to the news to see the SNP is imploding.Firstly, let’s get the Salmond dficulty out the road. Whatever happens with the pending Alex Salmond prosecution it has caused deep isions around competing loyalties within the SNP. Supporters of the ­Salmond or Sturgeon tribes have been briefing against each other. Were Alex Salmond to be cleared of everything, such behaviour will not be forgotten and of course he could be expected to seek re-election. What then for Sturgeon, what then for the SNP  More bitterness, manoeuvring and ision. Let’s not kid ourselves, the SNP will never be the same again, either because of something Alex Salmond might have done, orinnocent, because of the way Nicola Sturgeon has handled the accusations and process – or a mixture of both.Then we have policies like the Car Park Tax. It will be unjust, having no sense in regard to who pays it, who is given a free pass and whether or not they can afford it. The earnings of the driver or the size of car will not ­matter. And, get this, there will be VAT on top of the tax – because the tax will be a bill presented by the employer providing a serviceand so it attracts  per cent VAT on top. £ would become £, or £ would become £.I also have it on good authority that the tax was offered by the SNP to the Greens as a bribe to get their support for the budget – not the other way round. So it is an SNP Car Park Tax that the party cannot escape blame for.No wonder some SNP politicians are openly letting it be known they do not agree with it – it will cost them votes and cost the party seats in Holyrood.That never used to happen, but discipline has gone out of the window under Nicola Sturgeon’s autocratic husband and we rule. Where  in the Western world does so much power rest in a married couple ­holding the posts of party chief executive and Government leader  Not Romania, not the Philippines. Then there have been the protests about an audience member who gave the SNP Culture Secretary a roasting on BBC’s Question Time. The ­programme makers and the BBC have been accused of bias. This is a ­classic deflection of seeking to take away from and avoid discussing the home truths the member of the public made about SNP hypocrisy. Secondly, the man’s politics, religion, allegiances and number of appearances are all irrelevant – are SNP politicians and fellow travellers saying he should not be allowed to speak, that he should have duct tape over his mouth  Is that what an independent Scotland would be like  We also have growing speculation on Nicola Sturgeon being replaced as leader or retiring before she is served notice. Now that’s a new development, partly fuelled by yet another trip to the United States when the real day job of fixing our schools and hospitals is here at home. Is she being lined up for a job at the UN  Who knows, but the fact that I can even ask the question without sounding foolish tells you the SNP is no longer a happy ship.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"not appropriate to reveal if nicola sturgeon asked for independence referendum legal advice","story":"Scotland#s top law officer has refused to revealNicola Sturgeon has sought his legal advice on holding a second referendum on Scottish independence.Lord Advocate James Wolffe says it would “not be appropriate” even to say whether such advice has been sought in response to Liberal Democrat Mike Rumbles.The MSP has now written to Scotland’s Standards Commissioner calling for an overhaul of parliamentary rulesto force the minister to answer such questions.The refusal has prompted anger because the SNP had been calling for Theresa May to release her legal advice on Brexit.Read more: Nicola Sturgeon: I won’t call a second Scottish independence vote this yearFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon has pledged to set out her plans for a second vote on Scotland’s future in the UK in the coming weeks.

The latest conflict within the Conservative Party follows reports that the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on Europe, civil servant Olly Robbins, was overheard in a Brussels bar saying MPs would eventually be given the choice between accepting Mrs May’s deal or a signicant delay to Brexit.Mr Robbins, who has become a target for attacks by Tory MPs, was also reported to have said the controversial “backstop” provision to prevent a hard border in Ireland would become a “bridge” to the future relationship with the EU, signalling close adherence to Brussels rules.At Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford told Mrs May she had been “rumbled by your own loose-lipped senior Brexit adviser”.There were howls of anger from Eurosceptics over Mr Robbins’s reported comments, with former Ukip leader Nigel Farage calling for him to be sacked for “treachery and incompetence”. But Mrs May dismissed the issue as “what someone said to someone , as overheard by someone , in a bar”.And Conservative vice-chairman Chris Philp said: “What a civil servant might speculate in a bar after a few drinks is frankly not that important.”Downing Street denied the backstop would serve as a bridge, insisting it was “an insurance policy that is never intended to be used”.Speaking to the BBC ahead of today’s vote on the government’s “neutral” motion, ERG vice-chairman Mark Francois said: “We cannot vote for this as it is currently configured because it rules out no deal and removes our negotiating leverage in Brussels.“The Prime Minister,she went through the lobbies for this tomorrow night, would be voting against the guarantees she has given in the Commons for months.

The film is a nature study that follows a young girl and her encounters in the woods over one night, having lost her way from her family campsite. It is a lyrical and delightful portrait of a child’s perspective of the natural world.Last year ATLAS installed it in the south wing of Dunvegan Castle and ran an educational workshop programme with Portree Primary School and Portree High School.This year they are hosting cross-generational screenings with primary aged girls, similar age to the young girl in the film and the elderly generation. The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLASArts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap. He said: “It was wonderful to see the younger generation interact with their regular group and to enjoy watching a film together that connected with both age groups.”Sara Matheson, Portree Primary Head Teacher said: #Our pupils have been very fortunate to benefit from the work of ATLAS Arts. Most recently our primary seven girls have taken part in film screenings of Eglantine, both at Dunvegan Castle where they were able to hear directly from Margaret Salmon, and more recently at Home Farm and Tigh Na Drochaid, where they have been able to enjoy the film in a cross-generational context.She added: #As with all projects we have been involved in with ATLAS Arts, our pupils have been impacted very positively by these experiences. We look forward to working with ATLAS Arts on some new and equally exciting future projects.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye couple get green light for historic hotel conversion planners had tried to","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA Skye couple are aiming to breathe new le into an historic former hotel after councillors this week overturned an earlier planning refusal issued by local authority officials.Eilidh and Iain Mcniven#s proposal to convert a dilapidated wing of Pier House in Broadford into two flats and bed and breakfast accommodation had fallen foul of authorities, largely because of the design of the windows and doors they planned to install.However, members of the council#s planning review body ruled that, although the building#s appearance would be modied by the plans, all changes would be offset by the benefits of bringing the former hotel back into use.After Tuesday#s meeting Mrs Mcniven said she and her husband were now looking forward to seeing their dream become reality.She said: “We#re delighted that the outcome was in our favour after several weeks of anxious waiting.“We can now rest happy that the Pier House will be looking its best with windows that are appropriate for our new development. We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/BROADFORD-PIER-HOUSE-H-FRASER-3.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

But that is just one aspect of an ambitious multi-phase redevelopment project at the site.“The building had been lying empty for about five years and we are now turning it into a new facility to house everything that the charity does under one roof,” explained Via Wings founder Gail Redmond.Having previously rented premises in the town, the charity worked hard on fundraising projects for several years and received two signicant financial gts which allowed it to buy a building. In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.Discovery of mans body sparks murder probePolice called to deal with agitated male carrying alleged offensive weapon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DROM | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

The surfaces are in poor condition and very dficult.\"I would call for those doing this to stop.\"Ryan Gray Senior Maritime Operations Officer for HM Coastguard added: \"The recent photos taken at Ballycastle are concerning, we want people to enjoy themselves at the coast by making sure their visit is one to remember and not one they’d rather forget.\"We strongly recommend you do not attempt to climb up or down clfs unless you are properly equipped and trained to do so, and don’t attempt to climb clfs as a short cut. If unequipped for a climb it only takes one slip or a loose rock for it to end in tragedy.

It said it represented an increase of p per week for the average household and an average increase of £. per week for businesses.Deputy mayor Cheryl Johnston said: \"Mid and East Antrim Borough Councils approach is always to strike a fair balance between keeping rates as low as possible, with securing existing and attracting new jobs, boosting inward investment and promoting tourism and other key priorities across the borough.\"This is in addition to money council has also already secured for the next  years, at no additional unplanned cost to the ratepayer. \"This includes work on St Patricks Barracks development, The Gobbins phase two, Carrickfergus town centre regeneration, and rollout of broadband services in Carrickfergus and Ballymena.\"Derek McCallan, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association, said the overall picture from the council rates was one of \"growth and prudence\".\"Growth, in that councils are investing in high quality services from leisure provision to sustainable job creation, plus all of their regulatory and statutory services like environmental health and planning,\" he added.But he warned the Stormont regional rate could be twice as much as the council average. Mr McCallan said the relatively modest increase was in spite of tens of millions being added to employment costs over the next year. He said this was due to national pay agreements on the National Living Wage and new costs associated with increased powers transferred to councils from government departments.\"It is good that councils are combining growth and efficiency, keeping high-quality services, ambition and affordable costs in equal measure,\" he said.He added that the \"wider decision-taking vacuum\" caused by the Stormont impasse made it dficult for councils to plan properly for the future.\"Councils and taxpayers dont yet know what the Stormont regional rate will be, although it is estimated to be over % - double the average council rate and over twice the rate of inflation,\" he added. \"Frankly, unless the councils are given more resources to deal with an increasing set of expectations, they will be forced to make even more service cuts rather than expect local ratepayers to pay for services which should be supported by the rest of government.\"Belfast City Council, the largest, increased rates by .%.This means domestic ratepayers are paying an average extra p per month, with offices and retail paying an extra £. per month. Ulster Unionist councillor Peter Johnston, who chairs the strategic policy and resources committee at City Hall, said the increase had been kept to a minimum and would be accompanied by the £m City Deal for the region.Alliance had favoured a .% rise, claiming that £, for bonfire ersionary schemes - funding which has been criticised for a lack of transparency - was hiking rates higher than necessary.The biggest increase of .%, set by Derry and Strabane District Council, will see bills rise by around £. per month for householders. The council said the increase represents investment in new services, initiatives and strategic projects linked to a prospective City Deal.Earlier this month the councils lead finance officer Alfie Dallas said there had also been a \"signicant challenge\" with statutory pressures, such as nationally agreed pay awards, pay alignment and pension increases. The \"most challenging and disappointing\" aspect, he said, had been central Government grant cuts.\"The council has lost out on £, of rates support grant since cuts commenced in  , income which could have delivered a further minimum £m of capital investment or investment in other strategic priorities identied in our strategic inclusive growth plan,\" he said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37812018.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/kill.jpg","title":"ulster woman set alight by candle during mass saved by gaa star","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mrs Mitchell explained that following her sonrsquos death, his owed back pay from the Army would have settled the debt.The soldierrsquos mother also revealed that he had told her about two incidents in Afghanistan which had upset him.In one of them, he had been due to be the soldier at the front of the patrol but was swapped with a colleague at the last minute. The soldier who replaced him subsequently suffered severe leg injuries in an attack.Mrs Mitchell also told the inquest that towards the end of , her son had become hyper vigilant, confided in her less, was jumpy and struggled to sleep.She described how he had successfully applied for his ldquodream job in the Army as an outdoor instructor, explaining this had involved undertaking courses in the UK, Spain and Germany which left him very tired.The soldierrsquos mother also described how her son had felt isolated after a knee injury held him back from joining his unit in Afghanistan, and instead had to serve with a dferent unit.She said that when he ed to Ballykinlar and the new job, he continued to feel isolated as a number of soldiers were taking redundancy at that time.ldquoEverything hit him at that precise moment. He thought everyone was leaving, he was exhausted, his back pay hadnrsquot come through, he had had a row with Cherand he had just got back after being away for a long time.Mrs Mitchell added that she did not blame the army for her sonrsquos death but felt more could have been done to help him.A statement form Rleman Mitchellrsquos friend, Kendall Gibson, also referred to an incident when the  year-old ran away from fireworks.ldquoHe said the fireworks reminded him too much of Afghanistan, stated Mr Gibson, adding that he was also concerned about his friendrsquos drinking.Three soldiers mdash friends of Rleman Mitchell mdash who had discovered his body were sent twice to another barracks in Lisburn for treatment which included counselling.The inquest also heard that it was common place for soldiers to refer to the local army base as ldquoBally-kill-yourself.Driving instructor William Riley, who had been taking Lance Corporal Ross for HGV lessons in the week before his suspected suicide, told the inquest that the soldier was one of many who used the term.Mr Riley told how the Lance Corporal had cut a ldquofrustratedrsquo figure in the week before his death, displayed an attitude problem and had been involved in a verbal altercation with another instructor two days before his death.The inquest continues..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Art","story":"A HIGHLY acclaimed Downpatrick-based charity has secured a signicant financial boost from the Department of Justice.The Le Change, Changes Lives organisation mdash based in Market Street mdash has secured a slice of a near poundm funding cake made available under the government departmentrsquos assets recovery scheme.Over poundm has been distributed to organisations across the province since the schemersquos launch in , with the Downpatrick charity aiming to use its pound, three-year funding package to provide its clients with basic food hygiene training, alongside cooking participation and demonstration skills.The charity helps and supports people suffering with a range of mental health issues and addiction problems, offering professional and confidential counselling, mental health and addiction support and suicide intervention services.It also works to help minimise social isolation, alongside encouraging wellness and recovery and family support.Since its launch, Le Change Changes Lives has provided opportunities for people with a iety of problems to engage in constructive activities, including giving new le to old furniture through the very successful Pop Up Art initiative.The money secured under the assets recovery scheme, which is managed by the Policing and Community Safety Partnership, will finance the charityrsquos No Lost Cause project.Charity officials say the project is designed to provide an ldquointergenerational ersionary and therapeutic community programme which aims to encourage disadvantaged and disengaged people to find their potential and build upon it, using activities, counselling, advocacy, training and support.A logo is being used to publicise the project inspired by the lsquoNot Waving but Drowningrsquo poem by Stevie Smyth which is often told in Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. It gives an account of a drowned man whose distressed thrashing in the water was mistaken for waving.Charity officials say the No Lost Cause initiative is designed to complement the highly successful Pop Up Art project which is funded by the Big Lottery until this October.Over the le of the No Lost Cause project, charity officials will strive to reduce crime through erting people away from substance abuse and associated links to criminal activity.Le Change, Changes Lives officials have confirmed that the new project also aims to reduce reoffending by providing training and skills development activities and counselling to deal with substance and relationship family issues and provide support to improve the self-esteem of participants to help them re-engage with family and communities.They hope that through the basic food hygiene training, cooking participation and demonstration project that it will help parents revive cooking healthy, affordable family meals, to be eaten together at the kitchen table, helping achieve interaction and involvement in young peoplersquos livesAilish Teague, who helped establish the Downpatrick charity with her husband Manus, is delighted with the Department of Justice funding.She said competition to secure the money for the next three years was competitive, with groups in each of the provincersquos  councils eligible to apply.ldquoThe application was made through the Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the asset recovery is a brilliant resource, with money taken from criminals invested back into community projects, said Ailish.ldquoWe can use this money for the programmes we deliver, working closely with people who have a range of addictions.ldquoOur clients are also delighted that we have secured this funding which will enable is to deliver an NVQ Level One in hospitality services from our Market Street base with the food hygiene aspect of the course designed to give people a taste of employment.While delighted to have secured funding under the Department of Justice scheme, charity officials are conscious that their Lottery funding ends this October.Mrs Teague says officials have met with Lottery representatives and has suggested that the chances of having their funding extended are ldquozero to nil.She added: ldquoIt will be dficult to secure more Lottery funding which could leave us with no money to finance our core costs including rent and other overheads.

They were well prepared.ldquoThey had carried out research which helped them to face questions about migration and environmental issues.

Well, thatrsquos what happened when all of the farmers featured watched the programme a few weeks ago, said  year-old Geoff.ldquoIt will show that there is a real connection between the family and the animals and itrsquos not all just about sales or winning competitions.Two months before the crew started filming last January, the family were hit with terrible news mdash Bovine TB was discovered in their pedigree herd and  animals had to be slaughtered.A movement restriction then had to put on the herd which meant that no animals could enter or leave the farm until two consecutive TB tests prove negative.The programme catches up with the family on the day a vet calls to carry to do the next test and to determine whether any more of the herd will have to be slaughtered.ldquoIt just happened that the crew came to us in one of the most challenging times for the farm, said Geoff.ldquoAnd while I wonrsquot gave too much away, what happens not only affects me but also my children as they all get involved, especially the youngest Lucy, to help me get the animals ready for the likes of Balmoral Show.ldquoWe not only lost some of the animals but you also lose years of breeding, particularly with some of the animals my father had bred them, which was hard, and then of course, therersquos a knock-on loss of new calves.ldquoIt was particularly hard as I had buyers waiting to buy bulls and cattle of me but we couldnrsquot do anything until we got the all-clear.The tension builds over the next few episodes of the show as the deadline looms to Balmoral Show mdash the highlight of the farming calendar in Northern Ireland and the major sales day for Geoff.Viewers will see that the Rodgers familyrsquos hopes of further success at Balmoral are pinned on bull Mario, who Geoff described ldquoas a real character and his young half-sister, Nadia.This Farming Le starts tonight at pm on BBC ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"British Irish group on High Street conference  ","story":"THE impact of online sales on the High Street was discussed at a recent meeting in Newcastle.Representatives from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly were in the resort where they were met by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin.Mr McGrath explained the committee has a dferent area of investigation each year and that in  is focusing on the impact of online sales on the High Street and how governments can deliver initiatives and projects to address the problem.The Assemblyman said with the nature of the traditional High Street changing, many people, especially the young, are shopping online with this trend only going to increase.ldquoWe are seeing and hearing that people want experiences and see their shopping trip as much more than simply shopping, wanting to incorporate food and activities as part of their experience, said Mr McGrath.ldquoHaving clean, welcoming public spaces, areas that can facilitate events and having a erse range of experiential shops and boutiques is critical in making the High Street thrive. In Newcastle, the public realm and promenade schemes, in tandem with the shop front improvement scheme, have helped the resort buck the trend and is reporting increasing footfall.Mr McGrath also highlighted the need to continue to develop experiences people can avail of to maximise footfall and is confident ambitious future proposals including a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes will be critical to enhancing what Newcastle has to offer.He continued: ldquoIn Downpatrick, the former Irish Street police station and car park have the potential to redevelop the town and breathe new live back into its retail centre.ldquoDeveloping a space here which can enhance and deliver a customer experience and product will be critical to developing new shops and products, but also complement existing businesses too.ldquoRates and the entire rating scheme was a major recurring theme from business organisations and this will form part of a report being compiled by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly following their visit.Mr McGrath said the inadequacies of the rating system were well known, with the British-Irish body, of which he is a member, keen to find other ways of helping businesses thrive.The MLA added: ldquoTimes are changing and local authorities and central governments must reflect this in the work they do. I look forward to the report our committee will deliver which will reflect on time spent in Newcastle, Belfast, Dublin, Newcastle Upon Tyne and Stockton on Tees.Cllr Murnin said he was delighted that representatives of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly view Newcastle as an example of good practice for their research into revitalising the high street.He continued: ldquoWe have worked very hard to make our district a better place to carry out business and as a place to visit.

Itrsquos something I have always had to be aware of in my own le. I feel very strongly that there are issues in Northern Ireland that arenrsquot being addressed as far as mental health is concerned.A former pupil of St Malachyrsquos Primary School in Castlewellan, Niamhrsquos dficulties compounded after leaving Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch. A talented actor, who shone in the schoolrsquos theatre productions, she applied for and got a place at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in Cardf.Niamh was fortunate that while not academically minded, she found that drama, theatre studies and English always came ldquonaturally to her in school.The youngest of five siblings, Niamh says that she had always wanted to leave Castlewellan for ldquoan adventure. But she did not realise that her living in Cardf, away from family and friends, would take such a toll on her.ldquoI was just very, very homesick because our experiences in Northern Ireland were so unique and I didnrsquot have anyone that I could explain that to, she said.ldquoI felt emotionally unsupported. I felt very much like fish out of water as I was surrounded by a lot of very wealthy people and I struggled to connect with them. I was longing for the familiarity and the closeness, and the craic of home. My homesickness lasted for many years, it didnrsquot just go away.ldquoEvery time I went home for Easter or Christmas I was in floods of tears going back to the airport but yet I made myself do it, nothing nor nobody  was forcing me to do it.She went gone to appear alongside actors such as Sir Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame in an acclaimed production Macbeth which played Londonrsquos West End and New Yorkrsquos Broadway, as well as former X-Files star Gillian Anderson and  Shades heart-throb Jamie Dornan in the psychological murder drama The Fall.Niamh is currently working on two film projects and says that as a newly married woman, her professional and personal le is going great.However, she maintains her mental health by practicing yoga and mediation and feels it is important to be upfront about having had issues.She explained: ldquoI donrsquot see a problem talking about mental health because I donrsquot like that itrsquos still taboo. If it helps one person seek help, then thatrsquos great.ldquoPeople could be sitting with mental problems and they donrsquot know it. Because thatrsquos what anxiety and depression do, they sneak on you and it really starts to alter your view of the world without you noticing.ldquoOver time with mediation you can be in control of your mind. It does not have to be in control of you. Itrsquos easier said that done as itrsquos a long and slow process but itrsquos absolutely possible.While she has excelled in support roles such as the policewoman in The Fall and a nurse in Holby City, Niamh has her eyes set on being centre stage and ldquoplaying a really bad person in the future.ldquoI really want to play the evil person in something.

Hutley was given another chance around  minutes and this time took full advantage after Enniskillen had been deemed to be offside on the back of a break from Down scrum half, Chris Gibson.For the remainder of the first half, and indeed for  minutes in the second half, the score remained at - with both teams trading blows, but neither were able to alter their account on the scoreboard.Down did have their chances to take the lead, but lacked the finesse in handling that they had shown against their rivals from Carrick and Omagh in previous rounds.As the game entered the final quarter, Enniskillen managed to extend their lead, scoring a try by barging over from short range following a well won line-out.With Enniskillen now in possession of a  point lead, Down were left with no alternative but to chase the game. Again, they created some opportunities and applied pressure in Enniskillen territory with some great carries from Josh Hanlon, Conor Moag and Joe Charles, but the dogged defence of the locals held out and with it, Down frustration grew which made putting quality attacking play together even harder.In the closing minutes and with the outcome of the fixture already beyond doubt, Enniskillen added a final unconverted try confirming them as the team who would progress to the quarter-finals.The final whistle brought bitter disappointment to the hard-working Down squad who knew they hadnrsquot been at their best on this occasion.The side now enter the Subsidiary Shield competition and they have drawn Royal School Dungannon at home in a quarter-final game to be played on Saturday, February, , at am.Having been finalists in this competition for four consecutive years and winners in , everyone at Down High knows there is plenty left to play for this season..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch horse breeder is a very disappointed man this week mdash and all because of the lsquoflu.

The link with this area is part of our history, that is why I am here to meet with the council chairman and to visit local schools.The deputy mayor is keen to see links re-established between schools in France and the Ballynahinch area.ldquoThe link can help inspire young people in France and in this area and forging the link again will provide us all with new motivation, she added.David Stewart, who was a member of the former Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa twinning group and is now a key member of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group, is also particularly keen for the formal link to be re-established.As someone who has visited Lamorlaye on a number of occasions and witnessed the value of cultural exchanges involving young people in particular, he hopes formal links with the French suburb can be reformed.ldquoThe old twinning link seemed to lose some of its impetus, but the Rowallane and Slieve Croob group is a much broader association, he continued.ldquoWe are delighted to have some people from Galicia with us at the moment and it would be fantasticthe Lamorlaye folk could join our group as well to be part of the Celtic region partnership.David added: ldquoYasmine has told us about some of the reformed committees in Lamorlaye, some of which are looking at environmental issues which I believe would be of interest to people in our area.Karen Patterson, acting chairwoman of the Rowallane and Slieve Croob twinning group which includes Ballynahinch, Drumaness and Spa area, is also keen to see Lamorlaye join the Celtic region partnership.ldquoYasmine approached David and we are meeting with council officials to discuss reconstituting the twinning link. She is keen to meet with local schools and while the initial focus is on those in the Ballynahinch area, we would be keen to roll this out to others, Karen explained.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council provides us with financial support as does Sport NI and we are grateful for all the support we have received. As part of our cultural heritage, looking at our past and history and aspart of our overarching Celtic nations initiative, we want to bring everyone together.Karen added: ldquoMoving forward, the focus is on culture, sports, language, arts and crafts, music and dance. Rather than focusing on twinning towns, the emphasis is on twinning regions. We also hope to develop a three-way relationship with Rowallane and Slieve Croob, Vimianzo in Galicia and Lamorlaye.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, has praised the work and commitment of the cross-community twinning group.He added: ldquoThe group is all inclusive and open to everyone in the Rowallane and Slieve Croob area. Launched a year ago, I have no doubt that more success lies ahead, with the group building on the good work it has already achieved, fostering good relations, not just in this part of the world, but across Europe.ldquoThe possibilities the Celtic regions partnership are limitless in my opinion, helping make this district a vibrant location, not only to live and work in, but also to visit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"MRI scanner to remain at Downe for nine weeks  ","story":"A MOBILE MRI scanner at the Downe Hospital will only be in place until early April, health chiefs have confirmed.The South Eastern Trust has revealed that the scanner arrived at the Downpatrick hospital at the start of this month and is to remain in place for around nine weeks.Health officials said the arrival of the scanner is part of a ldquocontingency measure to maintain a service provision during the replacement of an MRI system at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.They have explained the scanner mdash which takes detailed images of the inside of the body mdash will help ensure that delays in patient appointments can be avoided.Over recent months, politicians and health campaigners have highlighted the need for a purpose-built MRI suite at the Downpatrick hospital, with health officials agreeing that such a facility would be a real asset to the hospital.They say it would ensure that additional MR imaging capacity was available locally to facilitate increased demand in this area of imaging.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed that the organisation was currently in the process of making a case to the Department of Health to provide a permanent MRI scanner in the Downe.She added: ldquoObviously, any decision would be dependent on a successful business case as well as capital funding being made available to the Trust.Politicians and health campaigners have been calling for the capital funding and revenue required to provide an MRI scanner and cover its running costs.They say local access to such a scanner would further enhance the range of diagnostic services provided at the Downe, ensuring local people would not have to travel outside the district to use such a facility.With waiting lists for diagnostic services continuing to increase at other hospitals, which impact on local patients, politicians and health campaigners are keen to see such a fully fledged MRI service available locally.They hope the work on the business case can be completed and that the Department of Health will pave the way for the new scanner to be provided.The provision of a new scanner would be a major boost for the hospital where work is presently underway to prepare for the opening of a specialist centre of excellence for cataract surgery.The Downpatrick hospital will be at the forefront of a new model of care under new Department of Health plans for the delivery of a range of dedicated day surgery services across the province.The new cataract service is designed to signicantly reduce surgery waiting lists, with the new consultant-led, elective care centre providing routine day surgery procedures at an enhanced outpatient department.Health chiefs insist the creation of the new elective care centres represents a ldquosignicant step forward in the transformation of health care and clearly demonstrates the benefits to patients.

His parents and medical team are constantly working to ensure his lungs remain as clear of mucus as they can be.Jen said: ldquoItrsquos hard to believe when you look at him that anything is wrong as he looks so perfect, but inside him the mucus is causing havoc.ldquoDermot and I never expected to becomes nurses as well as parents to our child.

There is no time to wait.ldquoTwo hundred and twenty six people have died in the UK since Orkambi was licensed over three years ago.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Police probe poisoning of two birds Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThe Northern Ireland bucket list -  things every person from N.I. should do before they dieTwo cases of meningitis confirmed at NI primary schoolMeningitis outbreak in N.I. - What we know so farN.I. child hasnt been seen since Sunday - P.S.N.I. investigatingDerry Girls series two trailer released          ..

Co-creator Alison Pearce said that the campaign aimed to inform young people just how unattractive prejudiced behaviour can be to fellow love seekers. She said: “We created this campaign because we wanted to make people think about their own attitudes and try and move discussion of this issue away from football and violence.“We have all came across people who either use sectarian language in company or post sectarian abuse online and it is a huge turn off for the vast majority of people.”She added: “Loads of people are using dating apps like Tinder and Bumble these days and it’s no secret users will go on Facebook and Twitter to get more of a sense of the person who may be liking their profiles.“If they see that you spend your time abusing others just because they are dferent from you it will hardly encourage them toyour interest. Our message is - don’t let blind hate cost you a first date.”Campaign director Dave Scot added: “This campaign is not only trying to get people to think about how their attitudes impact on others but on their chances of happiness.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.

Its surveying team are members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors . Nurturing talent and progression is a core principle that the firms stands for with  of their surveying staff having become qualied throughout the firm’s training program. We sat down with three members of the team.Gail Prentice-Jackson, associate director Over the last  years, Gail has worked right across the business, now within the asset management department.She manages a large mixed-use portfolio of property which includes leading shopping centres and retail parks right across Northern Ireland.Within that her role is ied and includes managing one of Northern Ireland’s most successful retail schemes. Day-to-day this can include everything from managing service charge budgets to maximising rental income through lease renewals and rent reviews. Another key role is to provide regular accounting and financial reports to clients.“One of my key roles is to support my agency department colleagues in their  acquisitions of investment assets and upon completion ensure that a comprehensive management regime is followed to ensure continued growth of our clients assets,” she says.“The role of a ‘property manager’ has evolved signicantly over the course of my career with much of our work now focusing on compliance and risk management. We pride ourselves on making sure our clients are well advised, mitigating any risks that may be involved with their particular property.”Some of those clients include retail sites such as Rushmere Shopping Centre in Craigavon.Gail is also one of just eight female surveyors in Northern Ireland with the designation of FRICS, a Fellow Member of RICS.“While females still only make up % of the surveying profession as a whole there are a signicant number of women working within the commercial property sector in Northern Ireland, it’s no longer a male orientated profession.”As for the business landscape Gail says that whilst there is general economic uncertainty they are seeing an increase in demand for their services as investors seek to maximisefrom their investments.“Interestingly we took on a number of new properties over the course of , often on behalf of investors who were keen to maximise rental s and ensure their property is run as efficiently as possible.”  Marian McFlynn, surveyor Since graduating from Ulster University in  with a degree in property investment and development, Marian’s career began on the other side of the globe – working for multi-billion dollar US-owned LaSalle Investment Management at its offices in Sydney.“In Sydney, as part LaSalle’s centre management team, I was responsible for leasing, marketing, administration and operation of a bulky goods shopping centre, home to over  homemaker and lestyle stores,” she says.“I ed to Northern Ireland, and joined the property and asset management department of Osborne King as a graduate surveyor in June ,” she adds. And following training, Marian became a chartered surveyor in . She’s now responsible for managing a range of commercial assets on behalf of clients. “This involves asset enhancement advice, tenant liaison, building maintenance, health and safety management, rent collection and accounting, service contract tendering and service charge administration,” she says.“I continue to build on my client and property portfolio.”And Marian also says that uncertainty hangs in the air for investors, while the ongoing lack of clarity over a post-Brexit landscape still exists.  Lisa McCaffrey, surveyorLisa has five years at Osborne King under her belt. Having graduated from the property investment and development course at Ulster University’s Jordanstown campus in , she worked at a Belfast estate agents before joining Osborne King in  becoming a chartered surveyor in .She works within the professional services team which sees her carry out valuations for a wide range of clients including private iniduals, large companies and the major lending institutions. As part of this Lisa is a member of the RICS Registered Valuers Scheme.Lisa also provides rent review and lease renewal advice to landlords and tenants throughout Northern Ireland.Additionally, Lisa was involved in the  non-domestic rating revaluation providing advice to a wide range of clients and negotiating the valuations with Land  Property Services on the clients behalf at application and appeal stages. Following the  revaluation Osborne King saved clients in excess of £.m. Lisa is working on the upcoming  non-domestic revaluation on behalf of a iety of clients.“I am fortunate to be involved in a wide range of work, some of which involves regular reporting to key clients such as one of Northern Ireland’s largest car showroom operators and well-known supermarket, convenience store businesses and global coffee brand.”  For more information contact Osborne King on   , email property@osborneking or visit the website at www.osbornekingView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/harbour_1221.jpg","title":"belfast harbour sets new cargo record","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Belfast Harbour has handled more than  million tonnes of cargo for the first time in its history.
