W. Bush sits by Barbara\u0027s...Avicii dead at 28: Wake Me Up DJ Tim Bergling dies in Oman...Share this articleKAYAKS MADE FROM FISHING NETSIn January this year, the first kayak made from recycled fishing nets came off the production line.It was created by amateur er Rob Thompson, who was desperate to find a use for all the abandoned nets, crab pots and fisherman’s rope he came across while exploring underwater.An estimated 600,000 tons of damaged or dumped plastic netting has built up in the oceans, where it traps and strangles sea life.He dreamed up a plan to turn the nets into kayaks, which beach-cleaning crews could then use to access remote stretches of coastline — and clear them of even more toxic plastic trash.He tracked down a recycling plant in Denmark that would accept old nets and convert them into recycled plastic pellets.Then, working with a kayak company called Palm Equipment, based near Bristol, he found a way to turn the pellets made from nets into a kayak by mixing the pellets with recylced marine plastic collected from beach clear-ups.Now Rob has teamed up with Keep Britain Tidy, organising volunteer ers and beach-cleaning groups from around the UK to gather fishing nets and ship them off to Denmark in bulk, rather than seeing them dumped in landfill.‘The first batch has produced 150kg of recycled plastic pellets, which is enough for six kayaks,’ says Rob.The prototypes are being used by beach clean-up volunteers, but the next batch will be sold (for around £370 each) and the proceeds will help rid Britain’s waters of yet more plastic (fathomsfree.org).SHAMPOO BOTTLES FROM BEACH WASTEThe sight of plastic food and drink packaging littering British beaches is a sickening reminder of the work that still needs to be done.But volunteer beach clean-up crews — many of whom will be taking part in our Great Plastic Pick Up weekend — have the option to put plastic that has been dumped or washed up on beaches into special bins funded by Procter \u0026amp Gamble.The company will then use this ‘ocean plastic’ — traditionally considered very difficult to recycle, as it is often degraded after spending time in the water — into new bottles of Head \u0026amp Shoulders shampoo and Fairy Liquid.  There’s 25 per cent recycled beach plastic in each bottle of Head \u0026amp Shoulders Beach, and 10 per cent in Fairy Liquid OceanThere’s 25 per cent recycled beach plastic in each bottle of Head \u0026amp Shoulders Beach, and 10 per cent in Fairy Liquid Ocean. The rest of the bottle is made of other recycled plastics.The process has been made possible by recycling company TerraCycle, which provides the bins and sorts the plastic. Its spokesman Stephen Clarke says: ‘Plastic coming from the marine environment is notoriously difficult to re-use, but we have found a technically revolutionary way of integrating 25 per cent of this plastic into the product.’DECKING FROM MILK BOTTLE TOPSImagine being able to wander into your garden to enjoy a morning coffee on your stylish decking, confident that it hasn’t started to rot over the winter, there’s no mildew to scrub off and no splinters — plus the satisfaction of knowing it’s also great for the environment.In recent years, the single biggest use of low-grade recycled plastic in the UK (such as bottle tops, yoghurt pots and bleach bottles) has been the manufacture of ‘plastic wood’ — plastic planks moulded to look like wood which are then used to build outdoor furniture and play equipment.The problem is most types look much more like unsightly plastic than timber.  Composite Prime has melted down recycled plastic and mixed it with unwanted off-cuts of hardwood, ground down to a fine flour, to create durable, low-maintenance decking which looks just like the real thingBut a company called Composite Prime has melted down recycled plastic and mixed it with unwanted off-cuts of hardwood, ground down to a fine flour, to create durable, low-maintenance decking which looks just like the real thing.Each plank has roughly 35 per cent plastic from discarded milk bottles and their tops.‘We saved over 9.5million milk bottles from landfill last year,’ says Charles Taylor, a director of the company.A KITCHEN FROM COLA BOTTLES . . .That plastic bottle you toss into the recycling bin could one day return as part of your kitchen cabinet door.Ikea’s new Kungsbacka range of kitchen fronts is made from recycled wood coated in a thin plastic foil made from recycled bottles, with 25 half-litre bottles used for each door.Darryl Pirie, of Ikea kitchens, says: ‘The range turns everyday waste into beautiful furniture.’Ikea also makes storage boxes (£3 to £12) from recycled plastic bottles, spray bottles (80p) from waste plastic collected from the store and its distribution centres, and a desk pad (£4.50) made with 50 per cent recycled plastic from Ikea packaging.. . . AND A MATTRESSYou could soon be dozing off on a soft mattress made from plastic bottles collected during the Great Plastic Pick Up. Silentnight uses 150 recycled plastic bottles in each of its Eco Comfort Pocket mattresses (£489 for a double, silentnight.co.uk).The mattress, launched last year, is made from plastic bottles that are crushed and spun into a fine, soft fibre. This is then used to form a special breathable layer that makes sleeping on it a cooler, more comfortable experience.In one year alone, Silentnight claims to have prevented 105 million plastic bottles from entering landfill or the sea.          Silentnight uses 150 recycled plastic bottles in each of its Eco Comfort Pocket mattressesROADS MADE OF PLASTIC PELLETSYou could be driving to work over a recycled plastic road.Toby McCartney, founder of road surfacing company MacRebur, came up with the idea after a trip to India. He saw locals collect waste plastic from rubbish dumps, pile it up over potholes in the road, pour petrol over it and set it alight. ‘I watched with fascination as the melted plastic moulded to fit the shape of the hole, effectively filling it for free,’ he says.Now Toby takes plastic waste from local authority recycling plants across the country — ‘It’s the waste plastic no one really wants and which would normally be incinerated or go to landfill,’ he says — then melts it into pellets, which are added to an ordinary road surface mix to supplement the bitumen.‘Our roads are up to 60 per cent stronger and ten times longer lasting — and they don’t pothole,’ he says proudly.COFFEE CUPS FROM . . . COFFEE CUPS!They might look like they’re made from paper, but most takeaway coffee cups are lined with a thin layer of plastic. It stops your coffee from leaking out, but also makes them notoriously difficult to recycle.Now a UK company called ashortwalk, based in Cornwall, has designed the rCup, made from discarded coffee cups.Managing director Dan Dicker explains that the company gathers takeaway cups from outlets such as McDonald’s and Costa. They are then washed, shredded, and mixed 5050 with recycled plastic from coffee cup lids and straws.The rCup is leakproof, insulated, lasts ten years and is fully recyclable (£12 from www.rcup.co.uk, Waitrose and John Lewis).          Now a UK company called ashortwalk, based in Cornwall, has designed the rCup, made from discarded coffee cupsTRAINERS FROM OCEAN PLASTICYour new trainers could once have been a discarded fishing net floating in the Males.Adidas has teamed up with a company called Parley for the Oceans, which organises coastal clean-ups in the remote island chain.The fishing nets and plastic they gather are turned into sports shoes.The upper is 95 per cent recycled ocean plastic that is melted down and spun into a technical yarn fibre called Econyl that behaves exactly like nylon. The rest of the shoe is made from recycled polyester.Marine waste is also used in the laces, heel webbing, heel lining and sock liner covers, adding up to the equivalent of 11 plastic bottles per pair.The Adidas x Parley sports shoes range starts at £69.95.          Marine waste is also used in the laces, heel webbing, heel lining and sock liner covers, adding up to the equivalent of 11 plastic bottles per pair.NEW JUMPERS FROM RAGSOutdoor clothing brand Patagonia was creating fleeces from plastic bottles as far back as 1993.Today it turns plastic bottles, difficult-to-recycle manufacturing waste and worn-out garments into thin polyester fibers, which are then used to produce clothing such as the Snap-T fleece pullover (from £80, eu.patagonia.com) which is made from 85 per cent recycled polyester.‘By recycling old products, we can keep many of the same materials in circulation for years instead of creating new plastic,’ says a spokesperson.SHADES FROM TRAWLER WASTE In 2013, a group of U.S. surfers and environmentalists formed a firm called Bureo to help fishermen in Chile discard their old fishing nets responsibly rather than dumping them at sea.The nets are recycled to create decks for skateboards (around £200, carverskateboards.co.uk) and the frames for high-fashion sunglasses.  The Mail\u0027s great plastic pick up  The Mail is stepping up its war on plastic with The Great Plastic Pick Up — a weekend helping communities, schools, families and iniduals come together to clear plastic litter from our beaches, beauty spots and streets, in partnership with Keep Britain Tidy.A staggering 7,330 people have already signed up, and there are 315 Pick Ups being held countrywide.It’s so simple to join in and you can win amazing prizes that may make all the difference to your community.

He is pictured a company after party in Beverly Hills, California on January 8, 2017Harvey Weinstein\u0027s laywers have called on the film studio he used to co-own with his brother to hand over a stash of his work emails, claiming they could help clear his name.In a filing with the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware, an attorney acting for the disgraced movie mogul said the Weinstein Company has refused to allow him access to e-mails that were relevant to ongoing criminal and civil lawsuits.The 66-year-old was fired by the company after dozens of women including actresses Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek accused him of offences including sexual assault and rape. The film studio filed for bankruptcy in March amid the scandal.Weinstein is the target of federal and state criminal investigations in at least four different jurisdictions, including New York, Los Angeles, and London, which have requested documentation relating to their cases, according to the filing.He is also the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble. Weinstein denies all claims of non-consensual sex. According to his attorney, Scott D. Cousins: \u0027It is critical that Mr. Weinstein be granted access to e-mails relevant to the certain civil proceedings and criminal investigations and that are in the Debtors\u0027 possession, as they were sent or received by his TWC e-mail accounts.  The 66-year-old was fired by the company\u0027s board after dozens of women including actresses Angelina Jolie (left, in London on Feb 18) and Salma Hayek (right, in Beverly Hills on April 14) accused him of sexual offences \u0027The Debtors\u0027 continued refusal to permit Mr. Weinstein to access these emails has significantly impinged his ability to effectively defend himself from these allegations and is a continuing deprivation of his due-process rights.\u0027Weinstein\u0027s lawyers previously filed a suit asking a Delaware state court to force open up access to his work emails on October 8, but that attempt failed.Anthony Bourdain advises Alec Baldwin to \u0027just shut up\u0027...Italian \u0027Harvey Weinstein\u0027 is charged with three counts of...Doors from the Chelsea Hotel sell for $400,000 including the...Share this articleCousins blasted the Weinstein Company\u0027s board, which includes his brother, Bob, saying it was against their interests to deny him access to the emails as doing so exposes them to increased civil liability.\u0027To put it bluntly, TWC, and its counsel, may be knowingly withholding e-mails that may exonerate Mr. Weinstein and, importantly, that would aid in the efficient conclusion of multiple pending criminal investigations and civil litigations, thereby limiting significant potential liability to the Debtors and their estates,\u0027 he argued.          Weinstein is  the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble (pictured in New York on November 28The Weinstein Company itself has been sued by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over claims it tolerated the \u0027systematic\u0027 sexual abuse of staffCousins said the Weinstein Company had already provided a \u0027handful\u0027 of emails which were already in the hands of investigators.He added that he was confident Weinstein would be able to obtain a \u0027favorable conclusion\u0027 to the cases against him if he is able to view the emails.The Weinstein Company was set up by Harvey Weinstein and his film producer brother Bob in 2005. It filed for bankruptcy after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor.Texas private equity firm Lantern Capital agreed to buy the company out of bankruptcy for $310 million, setting the floor for other bidders in a court-supervised auction scheduled for May 4.While the film studio has produced and distributed critically acclaimed movies as \u0027The King\u0027s Speech\u0027, as well as the televised fashion competition \u0027Project Runway,\u0027 the entertainment industry distanced itself from the studio after the accusations against Harvey Weinstein rocked Hollywood.The women who spoke out against Weinstein spurred a national movement against sexual harassment, with victims sharing their stories on social media and labeling them under the hashtag #MeToo. Dailymail.com has contacted Weinstein\u0027s representative for comment.            The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy after it spent months looking for a buyer or investor.

Neither of them would\u0027ve eaten anything if it wasn\u0027t for her.\u0027Mrs Wignall bumped into a friend of hers called Kate on the first day of the holiday and after spending time with her, realised she had been looking after the girls as well.The women claim they would look after the girls whenever they saw them around the hotel but they were often left with other families while their parents were out on the strip or at the bar.          Mrs Wignall\u0027s friend Kate Lees took to Facebook to share the \u0027shocking\u0027 story She told MailOnline: \u0027The first time I saw them I felt very uncomfortable.\u0027One night we saw them on their own and when we eventually found the mum she was absolutely paralytic. \u0027She was so drunk she couldn\u0027t even lift her head up to speak to us, let alone string a sentence together.\u0027I don\u0027t know where the step-dad was. The eldest kept saying she had to ring her dad in Scotland, we didn\u0027t know what was going on.\u0027On the final night of her stay Mrs Wignall saw the girls again and asked who would be looking after them when her and her friend had gone.She claims they told her a young couple from Wigan had agreed to take care of them while their parents went out.But when she came to check out in the early hours of Thursday reception staff told her the girls had been taken off the couple because they were also too drunk and their parents had been arrested.She said: \u0027When I left on Thursday I told the receptionist I had serious concerns about two young children staying in the hotel.           Mrs Wignall said the children \u0027could have ended up like Maddie McCann (pictured), who disappeared from her family\u0027s hotel room in Portugal in 2007 \u0027They said the father had been arrested and the hotel staff were now officially responsible for them, because the couple the parents had left them with were too drunk to look after them.\u0027The mum and step-dad had been taken away by the police and the children\u0027s entertainer had to stay in a room with there was no one else.\u0027Officials in Majorca said the police had been called after the mother allegedly assaulted one of the other women who had been looking after her daughters.Mrs Wignall says this was the drunk British woman, but this has not been confirmed. A spokesman for the National Police in Majorca said: \u0027National Police officers have arrested a British couple who were on holiday as the suspected authors of a crime of child abandonment. \u0027In the early hours of Thursday morning and at a hotel in Playa de Palma, hotel security staff were alerted to the abandonment of two children by their parents.\u0027The family of four had arrived two days earlier. Following their arrival, the parents were usually drunk and would regularly leave the hotel and leave their children there.          The couple were arrested by Spanish police on Thursday and the children left with social services until their mother was released yesterday. Her partner was not allowed to fly home to Scotland with them. Pictured: Palma Bay Club resort \u0027After security staff warned them about their illegal behaviour, they convinced another British couple who they didn\u0027t know, to look after their children while they went drinking in different bars in the resort.\u0027They would return totally drunk. They returned in the same state in the early hours of Thursday morning.\u0027For no reason the mother assaulted the woman who had been looking after her children and hotel security, who subsequently alerted police, had to intervene.\u0027Officers arrested the couple after reaching the hotel. They also discovered the tourist who had agreed to look after the youngsters was under the effects of alcohol.\u0027Mrs Wignall says she \u0027has thought of nothing else\u0027 since she left Spain.She said: \u0027People keep asking me how my holiday was but I can\u0027t even talk about it.\u0027Those people had gone on holiday to get drunk and ignore their children.\u0027I was going out of my mind with worry, I barely thought about anything else.\u0027I was waiting to pick up my children from school yesterday and I just burst into tears.\u0027The mum was allowed to fly home with them, but the step-dad wasn\u0027t, that really distressed the kids.\u0027The whole thing is absolutely shocking. When you have children they are your responsibility and your responsibility alone.\u0027Taking to Facebook after she arrived back in the UK, Mrs Wignall\u0027s friend Kate Lees wrote: \u0027I\u0027ve had the best time away just me and my youngest but I\u0027m leaving Majorca today with a heavy heart.\u0027We\u0027ve spent the week with two little girls aged 4 and 11... mainly because their parents were always drunk.           The British tourists had been staying at the popular resort of Playa de Palma outside the capital of Majorca\u0027Last night it came to a head and both parents were arrested after the dad was paralytic drunk and the mom had left the girls to look after themselves after she left the resort to go and party on the strip.\u0027I took care of them girls for 3 hours looking for her mom and we couldn\u0027t find her anywhere. \u0027They wanted to stay in my room, even a strangers room they\u0027d only known 2 days, so they could be looked after but I told them I wasn\u0027t allowed to do that and hotel reception had to take care of them. \u0027The girl was calling her dad in Scotland for help. This morning I had to watch them two beautiful girls get taken away by Spanish social services and taken to a Spanish children\u0027s care centre as mom and dad have been arrested and in Palma cells. \u0027Never have I witnessed such awful disgusting parenting and fear in two small faces. \u0027Parents if you want a holiday abroad and get off your face leave your kids at home.\u0027       "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/11/4B5715A100000578-0-image-m-60_1524220572386.jpg","title":"Natalie Portman says backed prize Netanyahu","story":"Oscar-winning US-Israeli actress Natalie Portman says she will not attend a Jerusalem award ceremony because she does not want to appear to endorse Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u0027I am not part of the BDS movement and do not endorse it,\u0027 the Oscar-winning US-Israeli actress said.\u0027Like many Israelis and Jews around the world, I can be critical of the leadership in Israel without wanting to boycott the entire nation,\u0027 she said.Israeli politician calls for Natalie Portman to be stripped...Prince\u0027s original studio recording of \u0027Nothing Compares 2 U\u0027...George\u0027s tears for Barbara: Ex-President  Bush breaks down...Share this articleOn Friday the Genesis Prize Foundation said that Portman had cancelled her participation in a Jerusalem ceremony slated for the end of June.One of Portman\u0027s representatives informed the foundation that she was troubled by \u0027recent events\u0027 in Israel and \u0027does not feel comfortable participating in any public event in Israel,\u0027 the foundation said.          \u0027I chose not to attend because I did not want to appear as endorsing Benjamin Netanyahu, who was to be giving a speech at the ceremony,\u0027Portman saidThe foundation did not say which events distressed Portman.Portman said her decision to stay away from the award ceremony had been \u0027mischaracterised\u0027, insisting that she wanted to set the record straight and \u0027speak for myself\u0027.\u0027Israel was created exactly 70 years ago as a haven for refugees from the Holocaust.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown described the MoS’s revelations as ‘horrifying’ and urged Google to pay users an annual fee for plundering their dataIt then uses the information to build an advertisement portfolio of its users’ interests.Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products.While most realise adverts they receive are often based on their search history, few will be aware of the extent to which the company tracks their every online move.Experts have warned that Google’s huge cache of data may breach new data protection regulations which are due to be introduced next month.Web developer Dylan Curran, 24, requested all the information Google holds on him and was stunned by the results.He said: ‘I work in technology and had no idea Google was harvesting this amount of information.          Businesses pay millions to Google to show their adverts to people whose data has indicated they may be interested in their products‘What was particularly shocking was it had a record of websites I looked at while I was in Google’s private, incognito mode.‘It also had files I had deleted from Google’s cloud service, including an old CV, as well as every photo I had taken on my phone.‘It’s wrong to trust any entity that big with so much information. They’re just trying to make money, and at some point someone is going to make a mistake.’A Mail on Sunday reporter discovered Google had an exhaustive and precise record of his activities for every day since December 2014. The information included times and details of visits to restaurants, shops and bars – and the mode of transport used to get there.The reporter’s movements were tracked with a blue line to indicate each location visited. Google searches he had made at each location were also included.Another reporter’s visit to a cemetery in Macclesfield was archived after he searched on Google’s Maps app for directions to a funeral. It also saved his search for directions to a hospital in Dublin when he visited A\u0026ampE, and later recorded when he was discharged.Lord Ashdown said: ‘I am shocked and horrified that the personal intrusion into our lives is so deep – if this was a communist state we would not be tracked so closely.‘I’m pretty tech-savvy and was not aware of this – it’s unbelievable.

But not many people know that the amount of information Google collects about them is just enormous.          But data experts complain the terms and conditions are confusing and do not state for how long it will hold their data‘It would be entirely possible to provide great services while protecting people’s privacy. But instead, Google harvests and centralises years of information on billions of people around the globe to exploit it for profit.‘Should any company have that much power? The risks to iniduals and to society at large are incredibly daunting.’Google says it has gained consent to gather and keep this data by asking users to tick a box when they sign up for a Google account.But data experts complain the terms and conditions are confusing and do not state for how long it will hold their data.Gini Blake, of data consultancy business GDPR Associates, said: ‘The problem is no one reads the small print – Google could say it will come into your bedroom and nick your underwear and people would still sign up to it. Google has an army of lawyers to make sure they are loosely adhering to the letter of the law but they are not adhering to the spirit of the law.‘I think the vast majority of people will be shocked to learn it has ten years’ worth of their data. Why would something they searched for a decade ago still be relevant?‘Likewise, why does Google need to know your exact location on a certain date ten years ago?‘The new rules being introduced in May are more draconian than the current regulations and Google may be forced to delete all the data it is storing.‘Under the new rules, data can only be stored if a user made a “clear, affirmative and unambiguous” consented action to have their data harvested – ticking a box with tons of small print will not be enough. They will also be forced to inform users how long they will hold on to their data. At the moment they don’t do that, so they could be made to delete any information they have that was not ascertained under these new rules.’A Google spokesman said people should use its My Account facility to safeguard data.He said: ‘The privacy and security of our users is of the utmost importance, which is why we have spent years making available tools like My Account so people can understand and control their Google data and make the privacy choices that are right for them.‘We encourage everyone to review My Account regularly, and 3.8 million people did in the UK in the last year. \u0027Your data makes things like Google Maps work better and more effectively, by helping to do things like recognising traffic patterns and help you find the quickest way home.’And look what they know about just three hours of our man\u0027s life... four years ago          Looking at my data from December 23, 2014, I saw Google recorded that I left my street in South-East London at 11.31am and, tracking me via GPS, it knew that it took me seven minutes to walk to Lee station11:31 - They know what you want and exactly where you go Looking at my data from December 23, 2014, I saw Google recorded that I left my street in South-East London at 11.31am and, tracking me via GPS, it knew that it took me seven minutes to walk to Lee station.

She also bears a resemblance to Ruth Defoe, played by Deborah Findlay (right)Baroness Shackleton, who bears more than a passing resemblance to The Split’s grand dame Ruth Defoe, played by Deborah Findlay (far right), has represented the Prince of Wales, the Duke of York and presided over Britain’s biggest orce when she secured £453million for her client Tatiana Akhmedova from Russian billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov.She says: ‘It helps to have a rod of steel through your back and loads of charm.’The £64m superstar  Her past training as an opera singer and her flamboyant dress sense gave lawyer Ayesha Vardag the nickname ‘Diva of Divorce’.Founder and president of her eponymous firm, Vardag, (left) could easily pass for aptly named Hannah Stern, played by Nicola Walker (right) in the BBC drama.  Ayesha Vardag, left, is nicknamed the \u0027Diva of Divorce\u0027 and could easily pass for Hannah Stern, portrayed by Nicola Walker in the BBC drama (right)Vardag, a mother-of-three, became a lawyer after her own orce and charges an eye-watering £845 per hour to represent everyone from a Qatari prince to the Marchioness of Northampton.In a landmark case, she won £64million for Pauline Chai in her orce from Laura Ashley chairman, Khoo Kay Peng.She says: ‘A separating couple will often genuinely race to get to me to represent them and not the other side.’The fab fashionista    Davina Katz (left), known in legal circles as the ‘soignée head of family law\u0027, dresses to impress– mostly in Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen.Charging £500 per hour, Katz, head of family law at Schillings, represented Kate Winslet in her orce from film director Sam Mendes and a number of European royals.  Davina Katz, right, charges £500 per hour to clients, and represented Kate Winslet. Right is Annabel Scholey from the BBC show who thinks nothing of sleeping with her clientsShe was also involved in the staggering case of Kathleen Wyatt, who demanded £1.9 million from green energy tycoon Dale Vince despite his fortune being made a decade after they split.Thankfully Katz only shares her love of fashion with the character Nina, played by Annabel Scholey (right), who viewers will see thinks nothing of sleeping with her clients.Katz says: ‘I rarely act for clients with wealth below £50 million\u0027.  Devilish detail...  Meticulous planning by show bosses meant spending weeks shadowing real orce lawyers – and observing the extortionate fees they chargeProducer Lucy Dyke says the London firm Stewarts Law bills in six-minute increments.‘The timer starts from the moment the client enters the office.’Away from the clients, the lawyers are not so tidy. At one point producers counted ten pairs of £500 designer shoes shoved under the lawyers’ desks.‘The paralegals have trainers under theirs so they can run to court to file papers before a deadline,’ Lucy says.The design team also had personalised pencils and mints made for The Split after seeing them at every firm. ‘We had to put notices up for the crew saying “don’t eat the props”,’ Lucy says.The programme is even filmed in a real law firm – the former offices of Olswang in London’s Holborn (above) – while the court scenes were filmed at a disused court in Kingston, Surrey.  Battles that go down to the baubles and pet dog   Despite the fictional stories that form the basis of The Split, not much can compare with the drama of real life.Family lawyers have told The Mail on Sunday a series of salacious anecdotes which make the on-screen antics seem pedestrian. Often, it’s the orce lawyers who take the flak.Deborah Jeff, head of family law at Seddons, had her tyres slashed after a long day in court over a £5million orce case.          Stephen Tompkinson and Meera Syal (pictured) play a warring couple in BBC show The Split ‘I took it as a compliment because I’d done an outstanding job,’ Deborah says. Debbie Chism, partner at Stewarts Law, who recently acted for Prince Louis of Luxembourg, has had people shouting ‘It’s MY money’ in her face.‘One client’s other half sent the keys to a property in something a horse might have done,’ Debbie adds.‘I sent it to their lawyer’s office, saying “You can open this”. The keys came back sparkling.’A colleague of Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law and consultant on The Split, had to hire protection after a disgruntled spouse threatened him during a case.‘He actually attacked the judge outside the court,’ Emma says.Who gets what in a orce, including a collection of Christmas baubles and the family pet, is often battled until the last. ‘I had one case in which no one wanted the poor dog,’ Emma Hatley, a partner at Stewarts Law says. ‘It was really old. We had correspondence back and forth about it. The housekeeper took it in the end.’There was a case where a spouse sowed cress seeds into the Axminster carpet and then watered it, while another wife sawed the legs off the family’s Steinway piano because she didn’t want the husband to have it.A priceless wine collection is destroyed in The Split, a common occurrence, according to Sandra Davis – head of family law at Mishcon de Reya. In one of her cases, wine ‘ended up being poured down the toilet by the people who didn’t own it’.Sandra has also experienced a wrangle over a tea set. ‘The lawyer on the other side dropped one of the cups. That resolved the issue.’Pre-nups are also big business and can be more than illuminating for clients. During pre-nup talks, one of Deborah Jeff’s clients discovered her fiancé had a child that she didn’t know about but she still married him.Deborah adds: ‘I was acting for a retired Army major who was marrying a much, much younger lady. ‘When we declared there wouldn’t be the generous settlement she backed out of the marriage. He was devastated but did phone a couple of months later to say thank you.’  PS...Love CAN blossom  After years spent locked in court together discussing the most intimate parts of their private life, perhaps it’s not surprising.But producers on The Split were told that it wasn’t unusual for clients to fall in love with their lawyers and declare it even if it wasn’t reciprocated.Regardless of any romantic outcome, many friendships are forged from the lawyerclient bond.‘I’ve been to a few weddings but I tend to go to more decree absolute parties,’ says Deborah Jeff of Seddons. ‘I’ve been sent a few invitations to lavish ones in which you have to fly abroad to celebrate.‘Some people seem to have a bigger celebration than they did at the wedding.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/21/21/4B674C0D00000578-0-image-a-9_1524340907375.jpg","title":"Man fed stomach run London Marathon","story":"    Gary Taylor (right) who is running the London marathon tomorrow with his friend Tim Jones (left)Father-of-two Gary, from Halifax, is believed to be the first runner ever to take part in the event who has to be enterally fed.

After basic searching and calling failed, they tried to lure with him treats such as sirloin steak and butcher’s sausages.They also tried enticing him with scent from a bitch in heat and even with unwashed clothes worn by his favourite member of staff from the rescue centre.The Campbells then adopted Drogo’s sister from Bosnia, to see if a family bond would bring him home.Meanwhile, Drogo has roamed the island, living wild, even through the harsh Scottish winter.Although he has evaded capture, the Campbells know he is alive and well. As well as sightings from across Arran he has been seen on a network of wildlife cameras installed by the family.Yesterday they pledged to keep trying to find their missing pet.          Paramedic Emma Campbell, 43, says that they have tried to tempt their pet back with sirloin steak and a bitch in heat but had no luckEmma Campbell, 43, said: ‘He’s a local celebrity. Everyone knows about this dog.’Paramedic Mrs Campbell and her husband Alan, 50, a roughcaster, have two children, Shaila, eight, and Gordon, five. The family, from Lamlash on the east coast of the island, rehomed Drogo as a replacement for their beloved dog, Bubba, who had died.When Drogo arrived, he was extremely nervous. Mr Campbell said: ‘He’s a lovely big dog. He never snarled, never bit anyone. But he was just so nervous.’ Mrs Campbell said: ‘I spoke to a specialist dog trainer, did research on how to settle him in, and stayed in touch with the rescuers in Bosnia. We got him toys, bowls, leads and a harness.’Four weeks later, Drogo bolted on his first proper walk.Mrs Campbell said: ‘He just panicked, knocked the lead out of my hand, and bolted. I did the wrong thing, and ran about trying to catch him. I now know you’re meant to crouch down and be quiet.          The dog is named after Game of Thrones character Khal Drogo, pictured, who is played by Jason Momoa‘We searched for hours. My friend put a post on Facebook and within hours the community rushed to help. \u0027We had 20 or 30 people out with dog treats looking for him in the first few weeks. But we were told he had gone into survival mode, wild mode, and he would just think everyone was a predator.’Drogo has been spotted across the island, which is 20 miles long and ten miles wide. Following expert advice, the family have moved traps and cameras to each new location.Mrs Campbell added: ‘It’s been crazy. After one sighting my friend Janis and I, and her dog, were sitting in Brodick graveyard for nearly an hour. We were going, “What the hell are we doing? We’re sitting in a graveyard with a bag of hot dogs”.’In September, missing dogs charity Harvey’s Army lent the family a cage trap. Baited with sardines, it was also fitted with cameras.In October, Julia Bate-Poxon, who runs the Bosnian shelter, sent a parcel. Mrs Campbell said: ‘Julia wore a couple of T-shirts constantly for three or four days.

They considered themselves British. My grandfather fought for the Allies in the Second World War and, when he left the Caribbean for a new life in England, he felt he was simultaneously leaving home and coming home.But those were the days when ‘No Dogs, No Blacks, No Irish’ signs were a common sight outside pubs and boarding houses, and it hurt my family deeply that they weren’t always given the warm welcome they expected. They had, after all, been invited to help rebuild a country shattered by war. Their passage on ships such as the Empire Windrush was subsidised by the British state.I have thought of my family and their friends’ struggle over the past week.Israeli secret service Mossad are accused of assassinating a...NHS sex change drugs are putting hundreds of children at...Share this articleYes, the treatment of the people affected by the Windrush controversy has been appalling and yes, the Government’s reaction to the gathering storm was slow. But now the Prime Minister has guaranteed a substantial response, setting up a task force to put matters right and taking action to make sure no one is left out of pocket and that the Windrush children’s rightful place in this country is restored.But it’s time to put the episode – as regrettable as it has been – into perspective. Over the past week I have been immensely heartened by the huge outpouring of anger from all quarters of society.This shows that, more than half a century after the first big influx of immigrants from the Caribbean began to arrive, Britain has accepted them.The sad thing is that it has taken a calamitous administrative blunder for it to be finally recognised that they really are as British as they always felt.Just look around. Britain has embraced immigrants as they have embraced life here.We have black and Asian MPs, Lords, lawyers and teachers. Millions pay to watch black and Asian sports stars every week or idolise black showbusiness celebrities. Last week’s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting reminds us all that the Commonwealth is both a family – the gentle links of kin and friendship – and a hard-headed business network.          Shaun Bailey, pictured, believes the Conservative Party should be given an opportunity to prove themselves after the Windrush scandal It is a mark of how far we’ve come that next month a mixed-race American orcee is set to marry into the central pillar of our Establishment – the Royal Family. Yet there has been barely a ripple of dissent about Meghan Markle’s engagement to Prince Harry.But the political heat and fury of the Windrush row should serve as a warning to Conservatives – and to the other parties, which in truth have a much poorer record on race. If we are ever to be regarded as truly inclusive we must embrace, and be seen to embrace, people regardless of creed, colour or social class.The Tories already have much to be proud of. We are on our second woman Prime Minister, we have a hatful of black and Asian MPs and peers, but we still have a lot of work to do if we are to convince people from council estates and comprehensive schools – just like myself – that we have the answer.I joined the Conservatives because I believe that all of Britain’s ‘communities’ want the same things: to own their own stuff, to progress in life, to be self-reliant and to have a stake in society both economically and politically. But to do this, we in politics have to be honest. We have to ask and seek answers to difficult questions.I don’t believe for one moment that the Windrush children whose immigration status has been questioned were ever singled out as targets for deportation. Instead they were caught up by an imperfect policy that was never intended to affect them.The debacle happened because the issue was never properly debated. I share Theresa May’s view that immigration should be controlled, but because we had signed up to the EU’s freedom of movement, Parliament has never decided how many should be allowed to settle here.Should immigration increase or decrease? If so, by how much and over what period? What are the benefits and problems? What measures can alleviate them? None of this has been discussed. And everyone is afraid to even mention race.The Left has seized on a leaked letter from Home Secretary Amber Rudd promising Mrs May she would give immigration officials greater teeth to accelerate deportation. Yet neither woman is remotely racist. In fact, their battle against uncontrolled immigration is both principled and colour-blind. Illegal immigrants are being targeted because they have no legal right to live, work or claim benefits here, not because of their colour.But Mrs May needs to have confidence to say the Conservative Party is truly inclusive, to encourage far more black and Asian candidates to stand in council and parliamentary elections and take part in all aspects of public life – as magistrates, say, or school governors.She needs to say that Brexit will give us the opportunity to treat all immigrants as equal – and that Britain provides a golden opportunity to all those who want to work.In short, she needs to be clear the immigrant dream of hard work and success is inisible from Conservative philosophy.And a welcome start will be putting things right with the Windrush children who have done so much for Britain."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/00/4B69874300000578-0-image-m-110_1524354970858.jpg","title":"Shock figures half graduates worst universities arent repaying loans","story":"    Bolton University vice-chancellor George Holmes, pictured, is on £220,000 a year, despite his university having the lowest number of graduated earning the loan repayment thresholdUK\u0027s biggest banks are pocketing £1BILLION a year by paying...Pippa Middleton, 34, \u0027expecting her first child\u0027 a year...Share this articleProf Holmes claimed starting salaries for Bolton students are lower because of reduced living costs in the town.He said: ‘Students do not hit the payback threshold as quickly but have a better standard of living with more disposable income.’Top of the league for well-paid jobs is the London School of Economics, where almost nine in ten graduates are earning above the threshold.

There’s 25 per cent recycled beach plastic in each bottle of Head \u0026amp Shoulders Beach, and 10 per cent in Fairy Liquid OceanThere’s 25 per cent recycled beach plastic in each bottle of Head \u0026amp Shoulders Beach, and 10 per cent in Fairy Liquid Ocean. The rest of the bottle is made of other recycled plastics.The process has been made possible by recycling company TerraCycle, which provides the bins and sorts the plastic. Its spokesman Stephen Clarke says: ‘Plastic coming from the marine environment is notoriously difficult to re-use, but we have found a technically revolutionary way of integrating 25 per cent of this plastic into the product.’DECKING FROM MILK BOTTLE TOPSImagine being able to wander into your garden to enjoy a morning coffee on your stylish decking, confident that it hasn’t started to rot over the winter, there’s no mildew to scrub off and no splinters — plus the satisfaction of knowing it’s also great for the environment.In recent years, the single biggest use of low-grade recycled plastic in the UK (such as bottle tops, yoghurt pots and bleach bottles) has been the manufacture of ‘plastic wood’ — plastic planks moulded to look like wood which are then used to build outdoor furniture and play equipment.The problem is most types look much more like unsightly plastic than timber.

AND A MATTRESSYou could soon be dozing off on a soft mattress made from plastic bottles collected during the Great Plastic Pick Up. Silentnight uses 150 recycled plastic bottles in each of its Eco Comfort Pocket mattresses (£489 for a double, silentnight.co.uk).The mattress, launched last year, is made from plastic bottles that are crushed and spun into a fine, soft fibre. This is then used to form a special breathable layer that makes sleeping on it a cooler, more comfortable experience.In one year alone, Silentnight claims to have prevented 105 million plastic bottles from entering landfill or the sea.          Silentnight uses 150 recycled plastic bottles in each of its Eco Comfort Pocket mattressesROADS MADE OF PLASTIC PELLETSYou could be driving to work over a recycled plastic road.Toby McCartney, founder of road surfacing company MacRebur, came up with the idea after a trip to India. He saw locals collect waste plastic from rubbish dumps, pile it up over potholes in the road, pour petrol over it and set it alight. ‘I watched with fascination as the melted plastic moulded to fit the shape of the hole, effectively filling it for free,’ he says.Now Toby takes plastic waste from local authority recycling plants across the country — ‘It’s the waste plastic no one really wants and which would normally be incinerated or go to landfill,’ he says — then melts it into pellets, which are added to an ordinary road surface mix to supplement the bitumen.‘Our roads are up to 60 per cent stronger and ten times longer lasting — and they don’t pothole,’ he says proudly.COFFEE CUPS FROM . . . COFFEE CUPS!They might look like they’re made from paper, but most takeaway coffee cups are lined with a thin layer of plastic.

They are then washed, shredded, and mixed 5050 with recycled plastic from coffee cup lids and straws.The rCup is leakproof, insulated, lasts ten years and is fully recyclable (£12 from www.rcup.co.uk, Waitrose and John Lewis).

Neither of them would\u0027ve eaten anything if it wasn\u0027t for her.\u0027Mrs Wignall bumped into a friend of hers called Kate on the first day of the holiday and after spending time with her, realised she had been looking after the girls as well.The women claim they would look after the girls whenever they saw them around the hotel but they were often left with other families while their parents were out on the strip or at the bar.          Mrs Wignall\u0027s friend Kate Lees took to Facebook to share the \u0027shocking\u0027 story She told MailOnline: \u0027The first time I saw them I felt very uncomfortable.\u0027One night we saw them on their own and when we eventually found the mum she was absolutely paralytic. \u0027She was so drunk she couldn\u0027t even lift her head up to speak to us, let alone string a sentence together.\u0027I don\u0027t know where the step-dad was. The eldest kept saying she had to ring her dad in Scotland, we didn\u0027t know what was going on.\u0027On the final night of her stay Mrs Wignall saw the girls again and asked who would be looking after them when her and her friend had gone.She claims they told her a young couple from Wigan had agreed to take care of them while their parents went out.But when she came to check out in the early hours of Thursday reception staff told her the girls had been taken off the couple because they were also too drunk and their parents had been arrested.She said: \u0027When I left on Thursday I told the receptionist I had serious concerns about two young children staying in the hotel.           Mrs Wignall said the children \u0027could have ended up like Maddie McCann (pictured), who disappeared from her family\u0027s hotel room in Portugal in 2007 \u0027They said the father had been arrested and the hotel staff were now officially responsible for them, because the couple the parents had left them with were too drunk to look after them.\u0027The mum and step-dad had been taken away by the police and the children\u0027s entertainer had to stay in a room with there was no one else.\u0027Officials in Majorca said the police had been called after the mother allegedly assaulted one of the other women who had been looking after her daughters.Mrs Wignall says this was the drunk British woman, but this has not been confirmed. A spokesman for the National Police in Majorca said: \u0027National Police officers have arrested a British couple who were on holiday as the suspected authors of a crime of child abandonment. \u0027In the early hours of Thursday morning and at a hotel in Playa de Palma, hotel security staff were alerted to the abandonment of two children by their parents.\u0027The family of four had arrived two days earlier. Following their arrival, the parents were usually drunk and would regularly leave the hotel and leave their children there.          The couple were arrested by Spanish police on Thursday and the children left with social services until their mother was released yesterday. Her partner was not allowed to fly home to Scotland with them. Pictured: Palma Bay Club resort \u0027After security staff warned them about their illegal behaviour, they convinced another British couple who they didn\u0027t know, to look after their children while they went drinking in different bars in the resort.\u0027They would return totally drunk. They returned in the same state in the early hours of Thursday morning.\u0027For no reason the mother assaulted the woman who had been looking after her children and hotel security, who subsequently alerted police, had to intervene.\u0027Officers arrested the couple after reaching the hotel. They also discovered the tourist who had agreed to look after the youngsters was under the effects of alcohol.\u0027Mrs Wignall says she \u0027has thought of nothing else\u0027 since she left Spain.She said: \u0027People keep asking me how my holiday was but I can\u0027t even talk about it.\u0027Those people had gone on holiday to get drunk and ignore their children.\u0027I was going out of my mind with worry, I barely thought about anything else.\u0027I was waiting to pick up my children from school yesterday and I just burst into tears.\u0027The mum was allowed to fly home with them, but the step-dad wasn\u0027t, that really distressed the kids.\u0027The whole thing is absolutely shocking. When you have children they are your responsibility and your responsibility alone.\u0027Taking to Facebook after she arrived back in the UK, Mrs Wignall\u0027s friend Kate Lees wrote: \u0027I\u0027ve had the best time away just me and my youngest but I\u0027m leaving Majorca today with a heavy heart.\u0027We\u0027ve spent the week with two little girls aged 4 and 11... mainly because their parents were always drunk.           The British tourists had been staying at the popular resort of Playa de Palma outside the capital of Majorca\u0027Last night it came to a head and both parents were arrested after the dad was paralytic drunk and the mom had left the girls to look after themselves after she left the resort to go and party on the strip.\u0027I took care of them girls for 3 hours looking for her mom and we couldn\u0027t find her anywhere. \u0027They wanted to stay in my room, even a strangers room they\u0027d only known 2 days, so they could be looked after but I told them I wasn\u0027t allowed to do that and hotel reception had to take care of them. \u0027The girl was calling her dad in Scotland for help. This morning I had to watch them two beautiful girls get taken away by Spanish social services and taken to a Spanish children\u0027s care centre as mom and dad have been arrested and in Palma cells. \u0027Never have I witnessed such awful disgusting parenting and fear in two small faces. \u0027Parents if you want a holiday abroad and get off your face leave your kids at home.\u0027       "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/10/4B67FBD700000578-5642629-The_Prince_of_Wales_raised_three_cheers_at_the_Royal_Albert_Hall-a-52_1524389333932.jpg","title":"Queen rolls eyes Prince Charles calls Mummy 92nd birthday party","story":"    The Queen rolled her eyes this evening when Prince Charles called her \u0027Mummy\u0027 when he took to the stage at the end of her birthday concert          The Prince of Wales raised three cheers at the Royal Albert Hall when he wished his mother a happy 92nd birthday as a star-studded celebration came to a close          Her Majesty the Queen waves to the audience after the concert in London celebrating her birthday  Make like Meghan in a Stella McCartney cape dressSold out!

They drove in a green Jaguar E-Type from the Englefield Estate to the Middleton mansion.           It comes after allegations of rape against David Matthews (right). He strenuously denies themTheir courtship involved a decade of waiting, meticulous planning – and a dazzling campaign of gifts and treats that extended to her parents, too.Thanks to the millions earned from Eden Rock Capital Management, the financial company named after his parents’ Caribbean hotel, James was in a position to woo Pippa in the most extraordinary style. Even before they became an ‘item’, James had flown the whole Middleton clan to St Barts, and his parents’ hotel. He proposed atop a windswept mountain in the Lake District with a rock said to have set him back more than £200,000.He was educated at Uppingham School in Rutland and won the British Formula Renault Championship in 1994 for Manor Motorsport. James Matthews is the brother of former Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews, who served as best man during last year\u0027s wedding. The couple went on a £120,000 honeymoon which took them to Australia and French Polynesia. Pippa\u0027s wedding was attended by actress and TV presenter Donna Air with her boyfriend, Pippa\u0027s brother James, while tennis superstar Roger Federer topped the guestlist with his wife Mirka.   Pippa first came to national attention at her sister\u0027s wedding to Prince William in 2011          Pippa Middleton and her husband James Matthews seen leaving St Mark\u0027s Church last year          Pippa and James Matthews began dating in 2016 and married near her family home last yearPippa Middleton is pregnant with her first child just weeks after father-in-law scandal"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/00/4B69874300000578-0-image-m-110_1524354970858.jpg","title":"Shock figures half graduates worst universities arent repaying loans","story":"    Bolton University vice-chancellor George Holmes, pictured, is on £220,000 a year, despite his university having the lowest number of graduated earning the loan repayment thresholdUK\u0027s biggest banks are pocketing £1BILLION a year by paying...Pippa Middleton, 34, \u0027expecting her first child\u0027 a year...Share this articleProf Holmes claimed starting salaries for Bolton students are lower because of reduced living costs in the town.He said: ‘Students do not hit the payback threshold as quickly but have a better standard of living with more disposable income.’Top of the league for well-paid jobs is the London School of Economics, where almost nine in ten graduates are earning above the threshold. The Mail on Sunday obtained the figures from the Student Loans Company, the Government-owned body responsible for administering loans.          Tory MP Rob Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee, said: ‘Between a fifth and a third of graduates are not getting good graduate jobs when they leave university. Instead of doing courses that are not going to get them graduate jobs, we should put a huge amount of money into degree apprenticeships, so that students earn while they learn and get a job at the end of it.’And Charlie Mullins, founder of the Pimlico Plumbers empire, suggested it was ‘fraud’ for universities to tell prospective students they need degrees to get well-paid jobs.A major report last year calculated that, in the long term, the Government will foot the bill for £5.9 billion a year in unpaid student loans."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/22/01/4B67D1CC00000578-0-image-a-23_1524358069946.jpg","title":"Cubas new President Miguel Diaz Canel meets Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro","story":"    Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel (left) and his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro (right) met on Saturday for Diaz-Canel\u0027s first official act as president           Maduro (left) was the first president to meet Diaz-Canel (right) since he became president Thursday.

During the late 1960s and early 70s, she used advertising slogans and song lyrics, as well as biblical verses and quotes from literature, to create vibrant silkscreens with trenchant political messages about racism, poverty and injustice.This year marks Kent’s centenary – she was born Frances Kent in November 1918 into a Catholic family in Iowa – and it’s being celebrated with an exhibition at Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft in East Sussex. What’s most striking is the juxtaposition of the monochrome nun – she wore the traditional habit complete with wimple and veil – and the brilliant colours which burst from her work.“Her art is expressive, exuberant, loud and boisterous,” says Ray Smith, director of the Corita Kent Center in Los Angeles. “But that contrasts with her own personality, because she wasn’t loud. She had a quiet intensity and was quite a private person.”Words sing out of Kent’s silkscreens, their simplicity often belying the complexity of their messages. In that they may have life (1964), she used images from a Wonder Bread wrapper to create a meditation on poverty and hunger, while in for eleanor (1964), she appropriated the US food giant General Mill’s slogan “The big G stands for goodness”, the source of which is a G for “God”.Threaded through her work is her life as a nun: she entered her order, the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, aged 18, trained as an art teacher and went on to head its college art department, leading to connections with leading artists, including the designer duo Charles and Ray Eames, film director Alfred Hitchcock and composer John Cage. But alongside acclaim from the art world came criticism from traditionalist Catholic churchmen – especially Cardinal James McIntyre, who took offence at works such as the juiciest tomato of all (1964), in which Kent likened the Virgin Mary to a luscious tomato.After the reforms of Vatican II, Kent and her fellow nuns decided to abandon their habits and do more community work McIntyre’s opposition to this led Kent to leave the order in 1968. She moved to Boston, living alone at the age of 50 for the first time. Her work between then and her death in 1986 is quieter and reflects a search for meaning from other religious traditions. It includes nature-inspired watercolours, as well as pieces that reflect her experience of cancer, such as live the moment light and out of the darkness (both 1977). But it’s her works from the 1960s that underline her relevance today. They trumpet her belief that social injustice can be changed and that at the heart of life it is love, and caring for others, that matter more than anything.Corita Kent: Get With The Action is at Ditchling Museum of Art + Craft, 5 May to 14 October (ditchlingmuseumartcraft.org.uk)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46969f6f0400caaabf4f2684c6b50914ac8dae8d/0_829_6884_4132/master/6884.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51f5c0aef75a10215fd018d8682757ca","title":"soviet film posters of the 50s and 60s in pictures","story":"After the break-up of the USSR in 1991, many artefacts associated with Soviet life – from posters to gadgets – were discarded, destined to be forgotten.

Emma Brockes meets her in New YorkWhen Hanya Yanagihara was 10 years old, her father let her visit a pathologist’s lab. He was a doctor and an artist, twin interests his young daughter shared so that when the pathologist opened the cadaver, she whipped out a sketch pad and started to draw. “I was always interested in the disease, not the human,” she says of that early fascination with medicine, a forensic interest that foreshadowed the themes of her fiction and, 30 years later, found Yanagihara in an unusual life: writing acclaimed novels at night, with a day job as a senior editor at the New York Times. Fiction, says the 43-year-old, “is a completely other realm that’s untouchable and unknown”. Editing a magazine – in this case, T magazine, the New York Times style supplement – is not. She smiles. “I’ve never done it any other way.”We are in Yanagihara’s office at the New York Times, where the wall is adorned with page proofs for forthcoming issues of T and a blown-up cover of A Little Life, her second novel, a 700-page weepy about a group of male friends in New York that was a big hit in 2015. (The cover features the now-familiar image of a man who appears to be in agony, but is actually drawn from a series of photos taken by Peter Hujar of men in the throes of orgasm.) There are plenty of precedents for best-selling novelists who also held down a day job: Arthur Conan Doyle was a surgeon Joseph Heller wrote Catch-22 in the evenings while working as a copywriter during the day Anthony Trollope did three hours on his novel before going to work at the post office, and Toni Morrison raised two sons on her own while writing novels at night and working every day as an editor at Random House. Where Yanagihara is unusual, perhaps, is in the fact that the demands of her day job require an enormous amount of nervous, creative and managerial energy, which the casual observer might imagine she’d prefer to invest in her fiction.In Yanagihara’s case, returning to the magazine world was a question of disposition and financial necessity. While a big seller by the standards of literary fiction, A Little Life was hardly Fifty Shades of Grey and Yanagihara lives in an apartment in downtown Manhattan with overheads that serious novels don’t support. It’s a stylish life and while she is dressed today in workman-like denim, an advertisement for the daylight-hours side of her nature, elsewhere whimsy reigns. In a recent photo shoot, Yanagihara’s apartment was shown to be stuffed with 12,000 books and various treasures (a plaster bust of Ho Chi Minh from Saigon a solid-silver cow from Mumbai a print by the Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto), a space she characterises as “dusty and cluttered” and about which, she says smiling, T magazine’s design editor “can’t say anything nice”. The magazine, which she calls “a culture magazine masquerading as a fashion magazine”, expresses not only the range and depth of her interests, but also a commitment to her belief in good writing. “Style writing shouldn’t be dumb,” she says. “It should be done with finesse, but also with as much authority and background as you would have reporting a piece about the NSA, or the Trump White House. We are part of a great reportorial institution, and I think style writing has become lumped in with squiffy opinions and laziness.”All of this may come as something of a surprise to those who only know Yanagihara through her novels, both the rigour of her journalistic engagement – she very much believes in reporting, quoting an old editor of hers who used to say: “When the writer does a story, I want them to talk to 10 sources and read three books,” an ethos which the New York Times, increasingly rarely among newspapers, still has deep enough pockets to support – and her discipline. In person she comes across as pragmatic, quick-talking, unsentimental about the costs of doing two difficult jobs, one of which is perennially living alone. A Little Life, by contrast, is expansive, overblown, at times almost mawkish, with a child abuse sub-plot of such startlingly graphic description that although it was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize, it has about it a whiff of the Pat Conroy pot-boiler.Working a day job actively helps with the other side of her life and offers some relief from the worst aspects of novel writing. “Magazines are very collaborative. It is something that’s created by many and that’s wonderful, because fiction writing is so interior and makes you into an awful person in a lot of ways. The private,” she says, “becomes much more sharply private when you have a job, especially one that’s in the world. It reminds you on a daily basis of what people sound like, how they move, what their concerns are, how they think.”When she started editing the magazine at the end of 2017, she felt as if she was “being hit by a bus every day”. But slowly, as she “gets used to the rhythm,” she feels the machinery of the fiction-writing side of her brain firing up. “I worked through the first novel, too,” she says. “Some people are very disciplined, but I’m not. I need something to parse my time.” Her job as an editor offers this, too: a daily reminder that writing is a business that should, to her mind, be characterised by “a useful lack of romance” that rests on the principle: “No one will read it if you don’t turn it in.”Hanya Yanagihara’s first novel, The People in the Trees, was published in 2013 and was partly based on the true story of Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, an American medical researcher who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for his work in Papua New Guinea and who was later ostracised after being convicted of child abuse. The story established the novelist’s twin interests in the traumas of the body and the way in which the mind seeks to absorb them – a theme she would return to in A Little Life, which has its roots in aspects of her childhood.Glancing at her biography, I had wondered if Yanagihara, who moved around a lot as a child, from California, to her father’s native Hawaii, to New York and Connecticut before returning to Hawaii again, missed out on having a single point of origin, the equivalent of John Updike’s Shillington, Pennsylvania, or Philip Roth’s Newark, New Jersey. In fact, she says, “I think of Hawaii as my Newark. I always say that for Asian Americans, Hawaii is the imaginary homeland. It’s the closest thing that Asian Americans have to Harlem, the place where everything about the culture at large feels familiar, or invented by you. It’s where I consider home even after all these years in New York.”Yanagihara’s parents – her mother was born in Seoul but grew up in Hawaii – met on the island and those early books by Roth were recommended to Yanagihara by her father, a great and eclectic reader whose tastes have informed her own. “He liked a British female writer of a certain age he loved Anita Brookner – and I do, too – and he loved Iris Murdoch and Barbara Pym. They’re books about loneliness and ageing, and they’re funny and a little devilish. Pym always has a few asides about how awful writers are, and Brookner does, too. There is a suspicion of the craft that the male writers of their generation didn’t have, a metaphysical reckoning of what is it actually doing for the world?”They are also books characterised by a stark lack of sentimentality. As a child, she wasn’t squeamish when she watched the pathologist at work, she says, “because death was a frequent topic of conversation and my father was never hesitant about showing me pictures of different kinds of skin illnesses, and so forth. It wasn’t something to be ashamed of – the body. Many cultures in the world are taught to be so ashamed of it that death is somehow embarrassing the naked corpse – you can’t see past its nakedness. Embarrassment about death, which is obviously linked to fear of death, is somehow equivalent to embarrassment about the body. This idea that the body is not about the form, but about the spirit animating it and once it leaves then it’s nothing, was never something that I grew up being taught to believe.”She would love to have gone to medical school, she says, and in fact after that early experience watching an autopsy, would like to have been a pathologist. “My father said it’s a good career because you’re left alone a lot and it takes a certain amount of artistry and technicality, and other doctors defer to the pathologist.”The secrets of the dead?“Exactly. But I just didn’t have the grades for it.”Instead, after graduating from Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, she moved to New York and went into publishing. Yanagihara wasn’t a good editor, she says. She couldn’t pick hits – “I didn’t have the eye for it. I bought one book the entire time I was there” – and so after a few years she side-stepped into magazines, working first at the now defunct Brill’s Content and later for many years as an editor at Condé Nast Traveller. “I liked the personalities there, I liked the brashness of it, I liked the democracy of it, the pace, working with visuals, and I liked the kind of sense, unlike a book, where it takes however many years for the poor writer to write and then 18 months to produce, that with a magazine you have a chance to make it new every single time.”It is her mother’s sensibility that has informed Yanagihara’s style, not only her taste but her belief in the importance of “material culture”. Her mother, she says, “has a great sense of design. She really understood textiles, she was a wonderful seamstress, she understands colour, she has excellent taste, and she can make anything with her hands. When I was growing up almost everything I had, from toys to clothes, were made. And she understands flowers – she could name a lot of things so could my father. It was important for them that I knew how to identify different chairs from different periods, or different fabrics, and they were interested in the people who made them. The idea of being a ‘maker’ was important the person who actually made things to beautify one’s life was essential to them. And they still make things. They’re currently learning how to weave Hawaiian straw hats. My mother makes beautiful flower leis. Doing things with their hands – they were both illustrators when they met.”The integrity of the product is its own reward and, to that extent, Yanagihara’s success as a novelist has been a surprise bonus. She expected A Little Life to sell 5,000 copies and would have been happy with that. Instead, it sold tens of thousands and inspired many rapturous reviews, including one in the New Yorker, which described it as a novel that could “drive you mad, consume you, and take over your life” – although, says Yanagihara, it often surprises people that after its success, she couldn’t put her feet up and retire. The money, she says, is not “enough for me to live on, which I think people assume it is”. One of the many reasons she returned to the New York Times was for the health insurance.When she took the job, she told her employers: “I won’t go out at night.” She judges this to be an important part of maintaining her stamina and preserving what energy she has left for her fiction. “I’ll go out occasionally for an advertiser event, if it’s deeply important but I typically only go out once a week. And the rest of the nights I spend at home, thinking and doing what I want.” (The only time she misses living with someone, she says, is “when something breaks”.)We get up to look at the page proofs for a forthcoming edition of the magazine, which is devoted to New York in the early 1980s, a period of cultural dominance in the city she compares to Berlin in the 1930s. “Every magazine editor has that period, an aesthetic set point they return to again and again, and for me it’s always been this one,” says Yanagihara. One photo spread features a group shot of people who got their start in early 1980s New York and looking at the line up – Willem Dafoe, Glenn Close, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, Harvey Fierstein, Elizabeth McGovern, Joan Allen, Cynthia Nixon, among others – you can only marvel at the hours that must have gone into arranging it. On another page, Yanagihara reproduces the spine-chilling news story from the New York Times of 3 July 1981: “Rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals”. Michael Cunningham writes the issue’s closing essay.It is a love letter not only to New York, but to the idea of the centrality of art and culture to one’s life and Yanagihara explains her own life – its fullness and sacrifices – by quoting from a poem by Kenneth Koch: “You want a social life, with friends  A passionate love life and as well  To work hard every day. What’s true  Is of these three you may have two.” If half the battle in life is in knowing what you want and, by extension, what you don’t want, then Yanagihara seems to have it down pat. “The things the book have given me have been so unexpected and lovely,” she says of A Little Life. “But it’s not something that informs my daily life. It’s something that happens at night and when you’re specifically called. The rest of the time you’re Bruce Wayne.” She smiles at the strangeness of it. “But it worked well for Batman.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38217da3fdc02b2ea43216ee58825ae63afe90dc/0_134_2728_1638/master/2728.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a6d9858aa0fed1474cf5b63c0515c1e","title":"my enemys enemy is now wetherspoons social media accounts","story":"On the news that pub chain Wetherspoon’s was to close down its social media accounts, I was surprised to find myself rooting for itAre pubs rightwing or leftwing? Let’s decide. We live in a very isive age, so I\u0026nbspreckon it’s as well to get some practice in. \u0026nbspYou’ve got to be on one side or the other. In everything. The enemy of my enemy is my friend, as they say. (And we say. A bit of consensus there.) And, of course, anyone who says anything remotely disobliging about my friend\u0026nbspis my enemy, as you’ll know if you follow Momentum on Twitter.When I say that, I don’t mean to be slagging off Jeremy Corbyn. In case you thought I was. If I did that, I’d never hear the end of it. For the more rabid Corbyn fans, suddenly that’s all I’d be: one of the accursed slaggers-off. (To be clear, I’m not saying Corbyn has rabies. Hardly anyone has rabies. In fact, it’s a compliment: I’m saying Corbyn has so many fans that the group includes people who have rabies. Which is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. Which makes his fan group enormous. Go Jeremy!)Some of the most fervent Corbyn supporters seem unable to perceive any human interaction, anything written, broadcast or expressed, unless it’s either supportive or critical of their political hero. Nothing else shows up in their brain. Like ideological\u0026nbspTyrannosauruses, their vision is based on the\u0026nbspmovement.(To be clear, I’m not saying Jeremy Corbyn is a dinosaur. I was just referring to some of his supporters’\u0026nbspselective perception of the world around them, via a comparison to something in Jurassic Park and a pun on “movement”. He is, to reiterate, just absolutely peachy and I would totally say that even if I didn’t want a quiet life.)So, in that binary spirit, I want to know if pubs are rightwing or leftwing. I know it’s a weird question, but I’m just talking about a feeling you get. For example, I’ve always instinctively felt that cats are female and dogs are male, but apparently it’s more complicated than that. What sort of a vibe do you get off pubs?Some would say that all businesses are a bit rightwing, being creatures of capitalism. But then there are all those shops in the West Country that sell crystals – they’re businesses, in theory, but if they’re rightwing then next thing it’s going to turn out that bears don’t like honey and hippos have really squeaky high-pitched voices and nothing makes any sense at all.There’s no doubt that small businesses, and particularly failing businesses, feel a bit more leftwing than big profitable ones. And I hope both sides of the political spectrum can take that as a compliment. A pub that’s gone bust definitely feels to the left of one that hasn’t yet, but might – which itself is well left of a thriving City wine bar.I suppose I’ve always felt that a proper pub is a little bit rightwing – a bit to the right of me, anyway. And sometimes a lot to the right of me. More rightwing than a toy shop or a dry cleaner’s or a church. There’s a whiff of Clarkson, of enforced meat-eating, of inidualism, of cash. A pub would go for liberty over equality. If a pub could talk, it’s going to sound more like a taxi driver than a drama teacher. Rightwing is a simplistic way of describing it, but it’s a lot more accurate than leftwing.This is why I find the JD Wetherspoon chain interesting. I don’t like Wetherspoon pubs – I think they bring the ambience of an airport right into the centre of town. They’re not really pubs, it’s just a chain of bars. But, unlike other bar chains, it has the temerity to affect reverence for the very institution it is helping to undermine, the inidual local pub. Wetherspoon has even named several of its outlets the Moon Under\u0026nbspWater, the name George Orwell gave to the ideal\u0026nbsppub of\u0026nbsphis imagination. That’s like Center Parcs calling itself\u0026nbspNarnia.Yet within the firm’s dark heart of inauthenticity, there glimmers the light of something real: it’s genuinely a bit rightwing. Again, the term is insufficiently precise. I don’t mean the corporate right-leaning of almost any plc – this isn’t about corporation tax rates or the trading environment. I mean Little Englander rightwing, irritable old man rightwing, “it’s political correctness gone mad” rightwing, proper pub rightwing. Because, despite its stock market listing, Wetherspoon’s major shareholder, chairman and founder, Tim Martin, is still in charge. Effectively, it has a landlord.So, when the news broke last week that Wetherspoon\u0026nbspwas closing all of its Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts – for both the company as a whole and all of its inidual pubs – I was very surprised to find myself rooting for it. The last thing I was aware of Tim Martin doing was putting hundreds of thousands of pro-Brexit beermats in his pubs. I wasn’t keen on that. I also wasn’t lost in admiration for his decision to open the country’s first pub at a motorway service station. He didn’t seem all that nice.And then he takes his whole huge company off social media, saying “I find most people I know waste their time on it. A lot of them say they know they waste their time on it, but they struggle to get off it.” It’s unsettling when someone you’ve decided to dislike does something you approve of. It’s how an acolyte of Jeremy Corbyn would feel if one of his detractors suddenly attempted to assassinate Boris Johnson.I’m not on Facebook (just one of many things I have in common with Wetherspoon) but, if I were, I understand I’d regularly be called upon to say whether or not I “Like” things. “Liking” things is a bit like liking things, but with an emphasis on people seeing you Liking them, rather than actually liking them. Anyway, historically I wouldn’t “Like” Wetherspoon. I dislike it. Is there a Dislike button? Or is that just taken as read about everything you haven’t actively Liked?However, it’s all relative.

The nation of “keep calm and carry on” and of “until death do us part” has often, it appears, given way to a land of attention deficit and the seductive thrill of quick fixes.No part of public life exemplifies this more clearly than professional football management. The average life of a Premier League boss now stands at just over a year. At the beginning of this season, Crystal Palace’s Frank de Boer set a new record by losing his job after five matches. All of which makes Arsène Wenger’s 22 seasons and 1,229 games in charge of Arsenal a modern miracle of persistence (in the same , Chelsea have gone through 19 bosses).The Observer is the world\u0027s oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791. It is published by Guardian News \u0026amp Media and is editorially independent.Wenger’s decision to call time on that £8m-a-year association last week could at least be presented as a final typically crafty bit of strategy. It was, perhaps, the last possible moment in which he could leave on his own terms. Measured in league position, this will be Wenger’s worst ever performance – Arsenal seem likely to finish sixth. But there is still the chance of the single achievement that has eluded the French coach in his long career – he may yet add a European trophy, albeit the second-string Europa League, to a cabinet that boasts three Premier League titles and a remarkable seven FA Cups. As with any true sportsman, he will like the fact that his leaving remains in the balance between bang and whimper.Either way, that last act will not disguise the fact that Wenger’s legacy goes way beyond trophies. Almost unknown when he arrived in north London in 1996, he inspirationally transformed not only Arsenal’s hard-bitten style, but also the idea of what football might be in England. More than any other inidual, he imagined the Premier League as the extraordinary global drama that it has become.Born in the ultimate no-man’s-land of Alsace, Wenger did much to create football that no longer recognised borders. He intuitively integrated different nationalities into his Arsenal team not only Europeans but, crucially, players of African heritage.With the application of groundbreaking sports science and a will to win matched only by his great rival, Alex Ferguson, his best teams married strength of purpose with an exhilarating freedom of expression. “The professor” described his sense of that task in terms that sounded wonderfully alien to the “up and at ’em” traditions of the English game: “My never-ending struggle in this business is to release what is beautiful in man.”That devotion to principled virtue – he favours the word “integrity” – in a shifting world awash with money, inevitably proved both Wenger’s triumph and his downfall. The certainty of his aesthetic vision of what football might be reached its high point with his unbeaten “invincibles” season in 2004. After that, as with any self-styled tragic hero, his purity of purpose began to look like a fatal flaw. No audiences are as restlessly demanding as modern football fans. Although reason dictates that only one Premier League team can triumph, and economics shows that it is invariably the club with the deepest pockets, merely consistent high achievement invariably translates on the phone-ins as “a lack of ambition”.Wenger’s singular efforts to “release what is beautiful” have more often in recent years unleashed what is ugly in a section of Arsenal’s supporters – their former messiah has been subject to predictable tides of personal abuse on and offline. Wenger’s response has been a mix of superhuman intransigence and an occasional raised Gallic eyebrow at the extremes of English anger. He has no doubt known for a while that the end was coming – but also that history argues that his detractors should be careful what they wished for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/add3f5b4829d01265e47e9a6e35573c0f8bf58ec/0_77_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee0d366c4255a3ead09c47ca2355261","title":"tammie jo shults a hero long before saving 148 lives flight 1380","story":"If Julia Roberts isn’t already on the phone about playing her in a movie, I’d be amazedAfter one of its engines appeared to explode in midair, a flight from New York to Dallas ended terribly and tragically with the death of a passenger, Jennifer Riordan, who had been partially sucked out of a broken window. The horror is unimaginable.It’s the nightmarish worst-case scenario that is never supposed to happen, the stuff of disaster movies, not real life. But the pilot of Southwest Airlines flight 1380, Captain Tammie Jo Shults, landed the plane calmly and successfully, on just one engine, at a Philadelphia airport, saving the lives of 148 people. Riordan’s death was awful the fact that the incident wasn’t even more deadly was extraordinary.When Captain Chesley Sullenberger brought US Airways Flight 1549 down on to the Hudson river in 2009, after geese took out both engines, he was lauded as a hero. Tom Hanks played him in a Clint Eastwood-directed biopic, Sully, which seems about as all-American an endorsement of courage and bravery as it’s possible to get. Sully offered his approval of Shults last week, and of the teamwork of the flight crew that saved so many lives, although cautioned that, in his experience, the trauma would long outlast any fuss or attention.Those present recalled that after the plane had landed, Shults walked through the aisle to talk to them, to see how they were doing. One passenger, Alfred Tumlinson, told reporters that he would send the pilot “a Christmas card, I’m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.” News outlets have delved into her life story and it has turned out to be astonishing. Shults was one of the first female fighter pilots in the US Navy and was elite enough to fly an FA-18 Hornet. She flew training missions as an “enemy pilot” during Operation Desert Storm, as women were then still excluded from combat missions.A Navy spokesman, Commander Ron Flanders, explained to Time magazine that she helped “male pilots hone their skills”. She left active duty just before restrictions on female pilots entering combat were lifted. If Julia Roberts isn’t already on the phone, I’d be amazed.When reading about flight 1380, any references to Shults’s gender have seemed to me to be entirely beside the point. When reports have described her as “a female pilot”, I have winced a little, instinctively. It’s the muscle memory that accompanies phrases such as “female comedian” or “female doctor”. She’s a pilot. That’s it. But equally, to learn about her past, in which being a woman made it harder for her to do what she did, makes it worth just a moment of added recognition of her incredible life and career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e81c39d95fcabec7744faa4a67c5f6a5b57b208/100_169_2241_1345/master/2241.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5822a9862fd18831176fff11172788","title":"treasure the london marathon","story":"Holding an arcane running world record gives the writer a rare insight into the eventOver the past year, I have run all of these world marathon majors: London, Berlin, Chicago, New York, Tokyo and Boston. In fact, I am a world record holder – albeit of the obscure record of running this full set of six (known as the Abbott World Marathon Majors) with a faster combined time than anyone else has run as a single series (an average of two hours, 41 minutes per marathon).But, like the other people who will run wacky world records in the London race today, including those in costume, the primary goal was not to set the record but to use the run as a means to raise money and awareness. (In my case, for an Oxford-based refugee charity, Asylum Welcome.)Each of the “majors” has its advantages: Berlin is fast, Boston requires time qualification, New York goes through five boroughs. But on several metrics London stands out as the best. It has more applications than any other race in the world, raises more money for charity and attracts more of the top-level runners. From Greenwich to Tower Bridge and on to Westminster, its carnival atmosphere is unsurpassed.In my day job, I focus on refugees and immigration. In the aftermath of the so-called European refugee crisis, migration was among the most salient and isive issues in the Brexit vote and in other European elections. This is one of many areas in which the marathon can play an important unifying role. At a time when the country is ided and British identity is contested, the marathon is a example of something we do together outstandingly. It deserves to be celebrated as such.From a sporting perspective, this year’s event has the potential to be one of the greatest marathons in history. The men’s race will pit Mo Farah against Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele, arguably the two best distance runners in the world. Both of them have a shot at breaking the world record. In the women’s race, Mary Keitxany will attempt to break Paula Radcliffe’s longstanding women’s world record.London, though, matters for reasons that go beyond elite competition. Hugh Brasher, the race director, is correct to claim that “since 1981, the London Marathon has been an extraordinary force for good that has inspired profound social change”.These impacts are arguably more important today than ever. The Brexit referendum revealed deep isions in our society, based on geography, age and social class. As across the western world, there is a profound ide between those who embrace globalisation and those who fear it. It might seem a grand claim, but the London Marathon reconciles some of these tensions. It combines outward-looking internationalism with deep community engagement. It exemplifies how working inclusively across national boundaries can bring local benefits – echoes of my day job.The most obvious contribution of the race is its role in charitable fundraising. Last year’s race raised £65.1m, more than any other marathon. It set an 11th straight world record for a single-day charity fundraising event.But fundraising is just one aspect of the marathon’s social impact. There is also important symbolism, which comes from the event’s inclusive nature. Today, the viewing public will be firmly behind Mo Farah. He strongly self-identifies as British, but we should not forget that he arrived as a refugee from Somalia. And there are other examples: Ethiopian Olympian Feyisa Lilesa lives in exile in Arizona, having crossed his arms in an “X” shape as he finished the Rio Olympics marathon in solidarity with the oppressed Oromo people. Former London winner Tegla Loroupe served as chef de mission of the refugee team at the Rio Olympics.More generally, one remarkable feature of marathons is that they level the playing field, albeit temporarily. A 26.2 mile run has no respect for wealth, social class, race, nationality or immigration status. All that matters is speed, endurance and character. The ubiquitous marathon image of Kenyans and Ethiopians leading the race subverts global economic hierarchies. People from all backgrounds participate in an event in which black east Africans are celebrated as the best in the world.And London is profoundly inclusive. It may only have 40,000 places to offer but they are equitably distributed. The marathon is one of the few sports in which amateurs can play in the same field as global superstars – the equivalent to being able to wander on to the pitch at Wembley and join in. The majority of places go to British residents, but they are from all walks of life. There are races within the race, including the British national championships and even the Oxford-Cambridge varsity marathon.The race consistently generates inspiring stories that defy the odds. Last year, amateur Josh Griffiths caught up with the elites to finish 13th and qualify for the world championships. Meanwhile, Swansea Harriers athlete Matthew Rees stopped 300 metres from the end to help struggling Chorlton Runners’ athlete David Wyeth to cross the line. This year, 87-year-old John Starbrook will be the oldest runner, participating in his 33rd London Marathon. And at a time when it is most needed, the London Marathon highlights so much of what Britain can be – a country of inclusivity, tolerance and solidarity.Alexander Betts is professor of forced migration and international affairs at the University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84de40058b04d132bd695998d1b807b8f4c8a218/0_251_3364_2018/master/3364.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6581385cf270abb6f37873cd3d051ba","title":"romola garai cultural highlights lincoln bardo st vincent viv albertine","story":"Actor Romola Garai grew up in Hong Kong and Singapore before moving to Wiltshire aged eight.

She has been nominated for two Golden Globes and a Bafta. She stars in Ella Hickson’s new play The Writer, directed by Blanche McIntyre, at the Almeida theatre, London, until 26 May.Lincoln in the Bardo by George SaundersI thought this was a completely sublime piece of writing. It’s really rare and hard to do something playful with form that isn’t excruciating for the reader. He did challenging things with language and multiple voices, but I never felt like I was being asked to do something that was impossible for me. I found it unbearably moving, obviously, because of the subject matter: it’s about the loss of a child, told through the perspective of a lot of people watching a famous man go through extreme grief. I was in bits at the end.I’m from the West Country, so this is very funny to me. It’s very grounded in place: Daisy May Cooper and her brother Charlie, who wrote the comedy, both live there, so it wasn’t someone from a city writing about the countryside. What I like about the show is you get the sense that, yes, there’s not a lot to do, and you do feel like an outsider because everything has become so metropolitan-centric – but there’s also a lot of humour and joy in that, because actually that’s just the way all people feel, like they’re not the ones at the party.I’ve been a big fan of St Vincent since her album Marry Me in 2007. On her new album, Masseduction, there’s a single, New York, and every time I listen to it it absolutely tears me apart, it’s so beautiful. There’s something innately powerful about a woman being on stage with a guitar. And she has embraced that in a completely unafraid-of-being-sexy way, which is very inspiring to a lot of women who feel it’s hard to do that and not be part of the male gaze.This is pretty much my favourite thing in the whole world – I’ve been an avid fan for years, and even embarrassingly have T-shirts and tote bags. They had an episode recently called Five Women, which was a really extraordinary piece of journalism, where one of their writers deconstructed five women’s experiences of working with a man. I thought it was a fantastic understanding of the complexities and difficulties of shared male and female work space, which has been in the public imagination recently. I really recommend it.To Throw Away Unopened by Viv AlbertineI haven’t read this yet, but her first book, Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys, is probably the best memoir I’ve ever read. She was a punk, and it was extraordinary for me to read about an era I feel so apart from. I was a child of the 80s and consumerism, and it’s hard for me to imagine what it was like to live in the 70s… the freedom, the courage they needed to be on stage and dress that way. She writes amazingly about being a woman of that time and how profoundly they were threatening men.This was on at the Orange Tree in Richmond and is coming to the National in June. It was an astonishing piece of theatre, talking about race in an incredibly bold way. It’s a weird, postmodern adaptation of a 19th-century play, and basically a lot of the characters, including the black actors, assume blackface. It’s difficult, because the original was trying to be an anti-slavery play but traded a lot on racial stereotypes. So it’s asking you to look at that, and at appropriation. I think no one could go and not get something out of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7726b621fc69001134046e888ac3da5e7b66529/0_45_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=535d31e607f6c9415f6a187918675fbe","title":"parents boycott sats tests","story":"When children across England start their week of Sats tests next month, 30 primary schools will be under particular scrutiny. That is because children from those schools have performed poorly once they have moved to secondary schools. That has raised suspicions that their good Sats results – more properly known as key stage 2 tests – were the result of cheating. Children from other primary schools feeding the same secondary schools, meanwhile, have performed roughly as expected.Cheating is one of the many reasons why Sats continue to face serious opposition. Parent groups such as Let Our Kids Be Kids plan to boycott Sats this year by taking their children out of primary school when the tests start on 14 May. Last year a headteacher of a Leeds primary school locked the Sats papers in a cupboard and took the children to the Captain Cook Museum in Whitby instead. In 2010 nearly 15,000 children in London did not take Sats after a boycott and had continuous assessments instead.Campaigners against Sats object to the huge pressure primary schools are under to deliver improvements year after year, which they say encourages schools to teach only the core subjects of reading, writing and mathematics, almost abandoning art, music, foreign languages and even science, which is only assessed in a random selection of schools.“Schools are judged, compared and ranked on these results,” said James Bowen from the National Association of Head Teachers.“If the scores aren’t good enough, teachers start fearing the implications and the interventions they might face – even the future of the school. The stakes are far too high.”Those stakes are high enough for some teachers to risk their careers. Over the last 12 months, three headteachers have been taken to a disciplinary panel of the National College for Training and Leadership – now the Teaching Regulation Agency – for altering Sats papers after they had been completed. In each case the heads resigned or were dismissed.A National Union of Teachers source told the Observer that in other cases, borderline pupils had done Sats in the headteacher’s office so they could be helped to get the right answers. “Another head prepared for a mental maths test by giving all the children a copy of the paper so they could see the questions,” the source said. “There was a teacher who read the multiple choice test aloud and emphasised the right answers. One pressed so hard when she was altering exam scripts that the marks came through on other papers in the pile underneath.“Those numbers are an overwhelming minority of cases,” Bowen said. “You have to question what is going on with the system where people feel driven to that kind of behaviour. No one trains to be a teacher thinking ‘one day I’m going to cheat in tests’. It says something about the system where people feel under so much pressure they start taking questionable action.”While the vast majority of the 15,000 primary schools in England do not cheat, Sats are still seen by some as disruptive. Little London primary school in Leeds decided to boycott the exams last year after parents backed the idea in a consultation, says Ivelina Metchkarova, whose son was in year six. The key factor was that school would continue as normal in the remaining eight weeks of term after Sats finished.“We were told that if there are no Sats, but there are extra assessments, then there will be continuous learning throughout the year until July,” she said. “If there had been Sats, after they finished the school would have been putting on plays. My son learned a huge amount in those three months and it really built his confidence.”Unlike GCSEs and A-levels, Sats have no bearing on a child’s future – they aren’t used for school selection, and primary schools send far more detailed assessments of each child when they move up to secondary level. Yet there is growing concern that the stress felt by teachers trickles down to the children. The Commons education committee said last year that young children were at risk of developing mental health problems, with evidence that growing numbers of children suffering from panic attacks, anxiety and depression.Alison Roy of the Association of Child Psychotherapists, which is part of the More Than A Score campaign group seeking to replace Sats, said it was common now to hear children as young as six say they feel “stressed out”.Madeleine Holt, More Than A Score’s spokeswoman, said it wanted to see a broader range of assessments.“In Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales they don’t do this. In New Zealand they got rid of them,” she said, referring to the National Standards tests that have been abolished.“The driving motive behind More Than A Score is to show that we are an international outlier. Most countries don’t do this. More and more parents are starting to feel that something is going wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8daf9ccd1c1129aa415c631aa14550f16d4528d3/0_207_5175_3106/master/5175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32854f6dba5105cdd4924f3c57d59dc7","title":"how to avoid clothes moths live in the east midlands","story":"Survey suggests pest problem is worst in south-east England, and in flats and pre-1950s housingGot a lovely collection of cashmere sweaters you don’t want devoured by moths? Then maybe you should move to a new-build house in the east Midlands. That, you see, is the type of dwelling and region least likely to be tormented by the pesky insects, according to a new study by English Heritage at least.English Heritage conservators have been monitoring the remorseless rise in moth numbers, blamed on a string of exceptionally mild winters – although the survey ended before the spectacularly bitter weather of last winter – and last year invited visitors to their properties to help by collecting free moth traps and reporting their haul.More than 5,000 traps were distributed across 42 counties – compared with the 11 sites English Heritage had been monitoring. The results will not be news to anyone living in the south-east of England, where supermarkets stock an array of moth remedies of dubious effectiveness. In London and the south-east each trap caught an average of 23 moths, while it was just three in the east Midlands.The south-west took second place, with 17 per trap, closely followed by the West Midlands with 16.The conservators are particularly concerned about the dramatic increase in a particularly destructive species known as the pale-backed clothes moth. The traps set by the public produced a haul of 460 of the insects, compared with 15 caught on the English Heritage sites.The results also suggest that flats, with shared walls between properties, and pre-1950s houses with more voids, fireplaces and attics than modern houses, are the most likely to be affected.Amber Xavier-Rowe, head of collections conservation, said the help from the public had been invaluable. “Now that we know where the clothes moth concentration is the highest, we can put in place extra measures to ensure that our historic houses in these areas are fully protected and preserved for future generations. We wouldn’t have been able to do that without the public’s help,” she said. “Operation Clothes Moth has really resonated with a lot of people who, yes, want to help us protect our collections but also to protect their favourite woolly jumpers.” English Heritage has collated its advice into a book published this week, which advocates a daunting housekeeping routine, including checking the undersides of chairs, moving and vacuuming under all furniture once a month – and emptying the contents of the machine and sealing the rubbish bag each time – taking all clothes out of wardrobes and checking and shaking them once a month, and regularly checking attics and chimneys. When prevention has failed, adults, eggs and larvae can be killed by placing garments in sealed bags and freezing them for a fortnight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce75d12bd9da67172fb8618498cecde6050ab677/0_143_5253_3152/master/5253.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db8feaeedb1f951507da302b24b690d0","title":"outdoor cinema britain boom","story":"Britain is in the middle of a boom in outdoor cinema, as people brave the unpredictable British climate to watch films “on location” in castles, aircraft hangars and even beach huts.George Wood, founder of Britain’s biggest outdoor film company, the Luna Cinema, says ticket sales have tripled in the past three years. “You strike gold when you can actually pair the film to the venue,” said Wood.Luna has shown Gladiator in the grounds of a medieval castle, Jaws at an outdoor swimming pool and Top Gun under the wings of RAF fighter aircraft. “It adds a whole other dimension to a film you might have seen 15 times before,” Wood says.Luna now plans to take giant 10 metre-wide screens to nearly 70 venues across Britain, three times the number visited five years ago. They will be erected in places ranging from Brighton beach to the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh.A former actor, Wood set up his company a decade ago, initially as a hobby to tide him through the summer when acting jobs were scarce.“I’d been to Australia and seen an open-air screen out there and thought: what a brilliant idea. I remember saying to my Aussie mates, why don’t we do this in England? And they all said, at the same time, ‘because your weather’s shit, mate’!”Undeterred, Wood hired a small screen and showed Some Like it Hot at Dulwich Park in south London. To everyone’s surprise – not least the council that gave him the permit – 500 people turned up to watch Tony Curtis woo Marilyn Monroe.Wood, who only days before had broken his leg in a moped accident, says he was hobbling around on crutches and thinking, “My God, this is it, this is what I’m going to do.”He says: “People thought that open-air cinema would be a fad, just one of those London things that wouldn’t transfer elsewhere. Actually, it’s the provinces that have been the real success story. It turns out that people in Lincoln love Top Gun as much as anyone in London.”David Cox, programmer for the Film4 summer screen season at Somerset House in central London, insists outdoor cinema is much more than just singalongs and crowd-pleasers.His “dreams”-themed summer programme includes David Lynch’s Blue Velvet and Christopher Nolan’s Inception, but such is the demand for the outdoor “live cinema experience”, as he calls it, that he expects to fill the 2,000-capacity courtyard every night.And it is not just Hollywood films on offer. Thanks to new hi-tech LED screens that work under direct sunlight, events such as Wimbledon, the football World Cup and the royal wedding will also be streamed live and alfresco.The phenomenon has also opened up the lucrative children’s market, with a series of daytime family programming planned for this year, featuring films such as Paddington 2 and Coco.Richard Cope, a trends expert at Mintel, thinks the booming popularity of outdoor cinema is because people are hankering for “old-fashioned communal viewing experiences”. He says: “It’s the American drive-in concept but done in a modern guise. People are so used to consuming media on their phones and iPads, there’s a natural craving for this kind of decompressed experience – where there’s loads of space, where you can react together, where you’re not just watching something on your own and tweeting about it.”Cope believes outdoor cinema works well for musicals and “scary” films, where groups of friends can chat and drink while watching. But the constant hum can be a “massive distraction” for arthouse movies, such as Blade Runner.“If you think about it,” says Cox, “it’s quite a vulnerable situation to be in. You don’t know what the weather’s going to do, there are no armrests to separate you from whoever you’re sitting next to, so people are putting their trust in each other – I think that makes them even more susceptible to watching a film and feeling it in a deeper way.“And then there is the beauty of being outside on a summer’s night. It’s a very different experience from what people might expect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e139f72ebc36d3f4eb7a07b140a323de9d4df5/0_8_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51b4481a0d719be9c782efb559d624ab","title":"verne troyer austin powers mini me cult star dignity and good humour","story":"Troyer, who has died aged 49, famously incarnated Mike Myers’ clone Mini-Me in Austin Powers, and was at the forefront of pop culture’s modern challenge to bigotry“I shall call him … Mini-Me!” This was how Verne Troyer was brought on to the screen, and into the world of cult stardom: a world which was part cruel, part affectionate. It was in the 1999 movie Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Mike Myers’s Dr Evil has just been cloned, and does a convulsive double-take on realising that his double is one-eighth his size. Two-foot-eight Troyer comes on in the Bond-villain quasi-Nehru jacket and impassively does the signature little finger to the lips move – worryingly like a precocious infant. An almost-star was born, although Troyer had begun his screen career in 1994 in the movie Baby’s Day Out when he had been the stunt double for a baby. Troyer repeated the Mini-Me role in the Austin Powers sequel Goldmember, had a small part as a goblin in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone – and with dignity and good humour sustained a career in reality television and the professional celebrity industry for almost 20 years.This career ned a period in which people of restricted height – Troyer had achondroplasia dwarfism – were starting to be regarded differently in cinema and in pop culture. People with dwarfism had always been treated exploitatively, and cinema from its earliest days adopted the robust circus tradition of using them brashly, unsentimentally, and expected them to behave in the same matter-of-fact way. And for many that was at least better than condescending pity. Tales of the Munchkin actors’ drunken behaviour on the set of The Wizard of Oz became legendary.Kenny Baker found his weird vocation in playing R2D2 in Star Wars. Felix Silla was an Italian circus clown who had work in comedies and scary movies (an habitual generic combination for actors with dwarfism). Zelda Rubinstein made an impression in Chevy Chase’s 1980 comedy Under the Rainbow, a 30s-period comedy, set at the time of the filming of The Wizard of Oz. British actor David Rappaport had a very similar career, but was given a chance to shine more than usual in Terry Gilliam’s Time Bandits (1981). But it was Peter Dinklage, Game of Thrones star, who has really escaped the patronising prejudice in a very contemporary way. He has stated that “dwarfs are still the butt of jokes. It’s one of the last bastions of acceptable prejudice.” It was a bigotry that his career has repudiated, although Troyer arguably couldn’t match Dinklage’s acting talent.In a way, Warwick Davis’s career is closer to Troyer’s: he acted in the first Star Wars prequel Phantom Menace and, ironically, replaced him in the Harry Potter franchise, but it was archly playing himself in Ricky Gervais’s TV comedy Extras that made Davis’ name. Davis challenged bigotry with confidence and black comedy, breaking the hush of liberal concern, and that was the same cheerful self-awareness that Troyer tapped into. There is an ongoing debate about the whole idea of “mini-me”: the idea that performers with dwarfism are just being demeaningly represented as comic or horrific miniatures. But Troyer at any rate tackled and subverted that idea — with confidence, with comic gusto and with charm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d76d89edc88d7c902e5961f751cc848478c067e/678_209_2318_1391/master/2318.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02f6057a1a7f0a1aad5ede7a729ae8c9","title":"verne troyer life in pictures","story":"Verne Troyer, who at 2ft 8in was one of the world’s shortest men, racked up 30 film credits in a career ning 24 years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ce92260f1fced98b30b3c767354ac8c50acf14/0_191_5184_3111/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138f5313b0a863f42e4fd26981e0deb6","title":"arsene wenger arsenal exit","story":"The saddest thing, perhaps, is that of all the thousands upon thousands of words that have been devoted to Arsène Wenger over the last couple of days, it is difficult to recall a single sentence arguing that this is all threatening to be one big mistake and that, contrary to what you might have heard, it isn’t the right time for him to go.It was difficult, however, not to appreciate the cartoon in Saturday’s edition of L’Equipe showing two Arsenal supporters debating the issue and the impression it left about how strangely unsettling it is to imagine somebody new in Wenger’s touchline seat next season. One of the supporters has a can of spray paint in his hand and has scrawled the words “Wenger Come back!” in red capital letters on a brick wall. “Was it not you who was screaming: ‘Wenger Out’?” his companion asks. “Yes,” says the fan responsible for the graffiti, “but, like Brexit, I’m afraid I will regret it.”Touché! And, yes, it is perfectly feasible that the Wenger Out fraternity might end up looking slightly foolish if the handover doesn’t go smoothly, as they often don’t, and Arsenal find the process of change far more challenging than the people who have campaigned for this moment might have\u0026nbspanticipated.At the same time, let’s not labour that point too much when Arsenal, 14 years since their last championship, are 33 points off the top of the Premier League and – if you need any more evidence of their loss of nerve and touch – the only team in English football’s four professional isions not to register a single point from their away fixtures since the turn of the year. Managers, like players, can have spells of good, bad and indifferent form, but it would be generous, to say the least, to depict Wenger’s decline as a blip when it has gone on longer than he would probably wish to remember.These are not the moments, perhaps, to be going back over Wenger’s flaws but it probably says everything that Sir Alex Ferguson, formerly the Arsenal manager’s bete noire, now describes himself as pleased to hear the news, on the basis his “friend” can get a proper send‑off.Pleased? Even ignoring, for one moment, the rivalry that once existed between the two men, Ferguson holds a senior position in the League Managers Association and that is not usually the word that would be applied when a member of the profession, with more than half his contract still to run, has decided to cut himself free on a go‑before‑you’re-pushed basis. What Ferguson means is that it spares Wenger avoid any more unpleasantness from the supporters who have been lobbying for the Frenchman’s removal. Except, of course, Ferguson started warming to Wenger only when he stopped having to worry about him, as the manager of Manchester United, a decade or so ago. Ferguson called a ceasefire, on his own terms, when Wenger stopped winning leagues and settled for FA Cups. On reflection, Arsenal’s crowd could be forgiven for preferring the days when the two men were bonded by mutual antipathy.Instead, Arsenal have finished, on average, 13 points off the top over the previous 10 seasons and whoever replaces Wenger will quickly come to realise there is no point having an obsession with attacking perfection if it is with a core of players who do not deserve to see their names on the back of Arsenal shirts. The new manager will inherit a squad that has become weak and vulnerable and, however it is dressed up, it is difficult to shake the feeling that Wenger’s resignation speech was written in the knowledge that the people at the top had made up their minds. Much better to announce it this way, you might think, than for Arsenal’s highest-ranking executives to prove they were not in a state of denial, after all.The important detail is that this is the one decision where nobody, it appears, can say Wenger has got it wrong. That, in turn, should dramatically lift the mood when Arsenal play West Ham inside the Emirates, hitherto a cauldron of doom, on Sunday. It is time, undoubtedly, for a rapprochement. It is time for the vast expanses of empty seats to start filling again and for the people who have drifted away – through staleness, anger, apathy, call it what you will – to make their way back. And perhaps it is time, as that cartoon in L’Equipe indicates, for some of Wenger’s more vehement critics to take stock of the last 22 years and remind themselves that the good far outweighs the bad.When Wenger was introduced as Arsenal’s manager on 22 September 1996 it was a rubbish-processing plant, rather than a gleaming 60,000-seat stadium, off Hornsey Road. It was the year Take That split and the Spice Girls formed. Diana and Charles orced, Major League Soccer was in its first season, Peter Andre was No 1 in the charts and something called eBay had just been launched if you could understand how to get the screech of dial-up internet. The London Evening Standard will probably never be allowed to forget its “Arsene Who?” billboards but, in fairness, there were a lot of people asking that question. “I’ve got to play for a Frenchman? You have to be joking,” was Tony Adams’s first reaction, give or take a few missing expletives.Nick Hornby, the author and Arsenal fan, recalls the moment in Jasper Rees’s book Wenger: The Making of a Legend. “When Bruce Rioch was sacked, one of the papers had three or four names,” Hornby remembers. “It was Venables, Cruyff and then, at the end, Arsène Wenger. I remember thinking as a fan: ‘I bet it’s fucking Arsène Wenger … trust Arsenal to appoint the one you haven’t heard\u0026nbspof.”The most prescient words came from Gabriel Vistotsky, a French subscriber to The Gooner, in a letter published by the fanzine a few weeks later. “Arsène Wenger is among the best coaches in the business, high above either George Graham or Bruce Rioch,” he wrote. “It is a risky appointment but if he succeeds Arsenal (and English football in general) will be better off because of him.” Yet the press were sceptical. The Sunday Mirror chided David Dein, Arsenal’s vice-chairman, for “persuading us that the lanky M’sieur Wenger, despite sounding like Rory Bremner auditioning for ’Allo ’Allo, is ‘ow you say fantastique!”, and not everyone writing in the temporarily renamed Le Gooner was getting carried away, either. The editorial noted: “No matter how many videos he has watched, or telephone conversations he has had with Stewart Houston, nothing will have prepared him for the combined talents of David Hillier, Eddie McGoldrick and Steve\u0026nbspMorrow.”Well, he didn’t do too badly. Two decades on, Wenger’s legacy will be as solid as the stadium he helped to design. He won the Double in his first full season and repeated the trick a few years later. His seven FA Cups alone are as many as Chelsea and Liverpool have won in their entire histories. Walk up the stairs at Arsenal’s training ground and the framed collection of letters in one long row – “WWWWDDWWWDWWWDDWDWWDWWWWWWWWWDWDWDDDWW” – is a reminder of the 2003-04 Invincibles season. Thirty-eight games: 26 “Ws”, 12 “Ds” and not a single “L” in sight.Arsenal’s unbeaten run eventually stretched to 49 games and it could be an awfully long time before another team threatens that record. The previous best, set by Nottingham Forest at the 42-game mark, lasted a quarter of a century. “Arsenal are nothing short of incredible,” Brian Clough said. “They could have been nearly as good as us.” Yet that was just Cloughie having a bit of fun when, deep down, he will have known that managerial greatness is not exclusively reserved for those who win European Cups. “Arsenal,” he added, “caress a football the way I dreamed of caressing Marilyn\u0026nbspMonroe.”That, in a nutshell, is how history will remember Wenger’s teams, rather than the fact that he never sustained that thrilling early momentum or the many occasions when we saw his less attractive traits – the man who hated to lose, the man whose insistence on old‑fashioned Arsenal values quickly disintegrated if things did not go his way.Wenger’s transformational work changed the team that attracted routine cries of “Boring, boring Arsenal” into the most watchable side in the country. More than that, he managed to assemble a group of players who did not just play with artistic merit but were also tough as teak. His team were filled with so many six-footers that Sam Allardyce, then the manager of Bolton Wanderers, said his own players found it intimidating when the two sides lined up in the tunnel.At some unspecified point, Wenger lost some of the underlying philosophies that had made his teams so special. But in his peak years he knew the value of a parsimonious defence. He understood his team could not pass the ball, cherish it, treat it like a friend, unless they had combative players such as Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit who could win it first and he knew that the best forwards, such as Thierry Henry and\u0026nbspDennis Bergkamp, had to mix their prodigious skills with competitive courage. Arsenal, at their best, were spellbinding.The game I always remember – and it isn’t easy, over 22 years, to pick out one – came at Elland Road in September 2002, at a time when Leeds were regarded as one of the top teams in the country. Leeds had finished fourth and fifth in the previous two seasons, as well as reaching a Champions League semi-final, but they took an almighty chasing that day. Arsenal won 4-1 and their performance was so thrillingly superior it did not feel outlandish afterwards to find Wenger making comparisons with the great Real Madrid, Borussia Mönchengladbach, Ajax and Liverpool sides that had shaped his thinking. His own team, he said, had a bit of everything. “Danger everywhere, tremendous spirit, a privilege to watch,” he said. “Total football.” On that form, he was asked, would Arsenal beat Brazil, the five-times World Cup winners? “It is difficult to say,” Wenger said. “If you can organise it I can guarantee it will be a sellout.”As it turned out, we never got around to arranging that game and, judging by Arsenal’s deterioration in the following years, let’s just say it is probably not an idea he might want to entertain with the current side. Back then, however, the thought did occur that it might have been the most beautifully constructed club side I could remember in English football. I hesitate to say that when I have watched in awe some of the more formidable Liverpool sides. I grew up with Clough’s precious magic and I had a ringside seat during Ferguson’s years of trophy-collecting for Manchester United – football, bloody hell, and all that. But Arsenal, playing at the point of maximum expression, would have held their own against anyone and, aesthetically, Wenger was right. It was our\u0026nbspprivilege."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc307b20306b67b33b3bb1de69cac79eb9064864/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=701ee366a31ab4d43923ea492c6b034a","title":"tottenham manchester united cup semi final mauricio pochettino","story":"It feels as though Mauricio Pochettino’s career at Tottenham has been a battle with the club’s essential nature, with the need to end the curse of Spursiness. Spurs had this game in the bag, then they did not and the result was yet another semi-final defeat.Perhaps the most impressive aspect of Pochettino’s reign is that every time he has been set a problem he has responded.Tottenham could not finish above Arsenal? They did last season and they will this at present the gap is 14 points. Tottenham could not prosper in the Champions League? This season they beat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund and should have beaten Juventus. Tottenham could not play at Wembley? They have lost twice here in the league all season. Tottenham have lost seven successive semi-finals? Ah. It is now eight and so long since they won an FA Cup semi-final that it was against a pre-Wenger Arsenal.That leads to other, deeper-rooted questions. Does Pochettino need a trophy? Of course not. Trophies are the point of sport, at least at a professional level, and there would be something very sad if silverware became less significant than league position, if the battle were transferred entirely from the pitch to the balance sheet. But at the same time there is something absurd about those who decry the progress made by Tottenham under Pochettino just because it has not yet been adorned by a trophy.Nobody, surely, thinks the last Spurs manager to lift silverware, Juande Ramos, did a better job than Pochettino is doing. Or take a look at the recent managers to have won the FA Cup: Arsène Wenger, Louis van Gaal, Roberto Martínez, Roberto Di Matteo, Roberto Mancini, Carlo Ancelotti, Guus Hiddink, Harry Redknapp, José Mourinho. Of those, other than the serial winner Wenger whose last success does fit the pattern, only Mancini lasted more than a year after winning the trophy – which rather suggests the demand for silverware is a red herring.Trophies are important and successes should be celebrated but in terms of the bigger picture the FA Cup would, at best, have offered some sort of validation for the work Pochettino is doing. But he hardly needs that and, whichever club wins or loses it, this season’s FA Cup will be forgotten by the end of August.When Manchester United beat Ajax in the Europa League final last season, Mourinho had his side target Davinson Sánchez, identifying him as the weak link in the opposition back-line. The Colombian has had a couple of iffy moments, most notably in the away game at Arsenal, but it is indicative of how good he has been that it has been possible for Pochettino to ostracise Toby Alderweireld as his contract dispute drags on.What Sánchez has that sets him apart from other Spurs centre-backs is pace, a vital commodity for a team that plays such a high line. But the centre of the Spurs defence looked suspect here and United caused problems, and scored two goals, by the simple expedient of putting the ball in the box.The sense in this season’s two league meetings was of a generational clash. On the one hand were United: tough, strong, sceptical of sophistication and fancy-dannery and winning at Old Trafford thanks to a long goalkeeping clearance, a flick-on and a neat finish as Spurs’ defence froze, as though dazed by the very simplicity of the move. On the other were Spurs: modern, vigorous, dynamic and far better in their win at Wembley than the 2-0 scoreline suggested.The game began like that league meeting here. Spurs were quicker, sharper, more mobile and took the lead with a goal of remarkable simplicity. Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen, though, then squandered chances to increase that advantage and Spurs ended up conceding the equaliser because Mousa Dembélé was caught needlessly in possession deep inside his own half.This was the Juventus game all over again, or a rerun of last season’s semi-final defeat by Chelsea: Spurs on top but lacking the ruthlessness to finish the game off.Tottenham, understandably, feel frustration that every slip-up is seen through the prism of their character, that every goal conceded becomes a glib reflection of their moral fibre. But they had this game in their grasp and lost. For all Pochettino’s best efforts, not far beneath the surface traces of Spursiness still\u0026nbsplinger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a04a1a573a13f82df117ceb4dc3c788f197665e/0_913_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d8500d148f1577affe8752de22d049a","title":"amy schumer interview film i feel pretty marriage love stand up","story":"Outrageously rude and shockingly funny, Amy Schumer has always made her audiences gasp. She talks to  Sophie Heawood about falling in love, one-night stands and going nuts on stageWhen I meet Amy Schumer, she has been married for exactly one month and is working on a joke about her husband’s penis. Something along the lines of, my husband is uncircumcised – for now. She had jotted it down on the Notes app on her iPhone, where she keeps a lot of ideas, but it duplicated the note five times “so now it looks like I really have plans to mutilate him,” she says.She then admits that she actually first used that line about another man she used to date, “but you have to update it so it’s about the person you’re with now. And really, my husband is good, he can keep everything he has. At this point in my life, I’m cool with foreskin or not – God bless everyone and their penii,” she says, breezily, as if she might have exhausted herself by creating a persona who is supposed to care so much.Amy Schumer is a conundrum. A native New Yorker, she made her incredibly successful name doing stand-up comedy about raw, rude sex and all of its discontents, about dating and dirtiness and blacking out drunk and doing the walk of shame home. Her TV sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, ran for four series on Comedy Central and often mercilessly skewered the gender hypocrisy of what our culture allows men and women to do, in particular the beauty myths that silently surround women, in sketches such as “Girl You Don’t Need Makeup” and “Her Last Fuckable Day”.At the Glamour awards in London in 2015, after various female celebrities had tottered up to the stage to receive awards in heels they could barely walk in and dresses they could barely breathe in, Schumer strode on. “I’m probably 160lb right now,” she said, looking out over the audience with disdain, “and I can catch a dick whenever I want. That’s the truth.” I was there she changed the mood of the room from faux modesty to explosive, spluttering laughter, and all the disdained women ran up to her afterwards, desperate to be her friend. It felt like a tipping point in that industry famous women have been letting their guard down ever since.Yet a couple of months later, her debut movie Trainwreck came out, which she wrote and starred in. It began promisingly and originally, but ended with her character giving up her competitive career and literally becoming a cheerleader – an actual cheerleader – for her clever, high-achieving man. The next year Schumer published her autobiography, The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, in which, alongside stories of a childhood going from riches to rags on Long Island with her dad’s dodgy business skills and then illness, and both her parents’ philandering, she wrote that, actually, she had only ever had a one-night stand once, and it was lovely and respectful, thank you very much.Now she has made I Feel Pretty, a film about a woman who gets a bash on the head and wrongly believes herself to have become as beautiful as a supermodel, and so creates a whole new life for her sexy self. The film asks if beauty is a state of mind – while also involving Schumeresque motifs such as a vaginal injury on an exercise bike.Meanwhile, Schumer has surprised the gossip papers by suddenly getting married, to a chef called Chris Fischer, in a lacy white wedding dress on a clifftop in Malibu. For celebrities, this is as traditional as your father walking you down the aisle in your village church. Coverage of the wedding made it all sound rather giddy and impulsive, but when I ask her about it, she is anything but.“I feel exactly the same as before I was married – but I’m psyched. I love him,” she says, her face deadly serious, like she’s been through a thing or two in this life. “Like, I’m fucking – it feels like having a partner. It feels like not being alone.” We are sitting in a rather fancy hotel suite overlooking Central Park, where Schumer is promoting her new movie. Her bodyguard is in the next room, along with two assistants who have taken Schumer’s tiny black poodle Tatiana, who was barking too much for the interview. “He’s 38, I’m 36, so, you know, we are not completing each other. We already are who we are and just want to support and encourage each other. And so I’m psyched that I don’t have to be zipping up my knee boots, leaving someone’s apartment at 3am. I’m done.” She says this wasn’t like other relationships, “where you’re like, come on, pleeease meet my parents. I can’t believe I dealt with any of that bullshit before! This was like, oh my God I fucking love this person, and I admire him, and we’re a team and he was ready.”I ask her if it is hard, having created such a bold sexual persona, ever to find the space to feel shy, but she looks baffled by that question and says that she isn’t ever shy. In fact, she looks baffled by quite a few of my questions: interviews are clearly not her favourite thing. I want to discuss her work being about the concept of fuckability, but she says that that’s not accurate, and turns her nose up a bit.She says this film is about her character Renee simply wanting to be seen, and though there’s a boyfriend angle, “I don’t think of this movie as a love story. It’s about her and her friends.” She says the dressing-up is for other women, because she has learned, with age, that we don’t really dress for men. “In my experience, men are not that psyched and the guys that I’m attracted to aren’t the guys who are like, ‘Oh, is that the new Givenchy line?’ I think, her thing is about confidence and about feeling attractive.”Well, yes and no. I mean if it’s all about women, then her character entering a bikini competition and shaking her stuff all over the stage in a e bar full of men does seem an interesting move. Yet the thing about the bikini scene is – it becomes lovely. You start watching it behind your hands, cringing – and by the end you’re charmed by the sight of someone just thoroughly, unabashedly enjoying herself.Schumer is glad I liked that scene, and says she fought for it. She was supposed to just stand there, “but I said no, I’m going to go nuts on stage, I’m going to dump water on myself, do the whole thing. And I seriously fought everybody and I’m so glad I did.” She also has a sex scene, and fought to be allowed to reveal more flesh but still have the film rated 13. “I think we should see more, you know, and I’m not letting them retouch any of me in the movie.”There is an idiosyncratic, pioneering power to Schumer’s comedy work that I keep looking for in her films. They veer towards slapstick whereas her solo material has brains and guts. I do not make myself popular by suggesting this, and Schumer bristles when I ask what sort of movies she would make if there was no financial compulsion for feelgood endings.“You know, I said no to a movie where I would have made five times this amount of money,” she says. Really? Someone else’s project? “Mmm,” she replies, mysteriously. “For me, it’s not so much about the money. Like, I wouldn’t want to spend three years of my life working on The Revenant. I filmed a drama two years ago and it was a bummer. I don’t want to show people what I can do – I just want to do stuff that will make people feel better.”Hot women, once the butt of her jokes, now get cast in her films. I Feel Pretty co-stars Emily Ratajkowski, who rose to fame dancing topless in the Blurred Lines music video, and also features a cameo from Naomi Campbell. “I did a lot of press yesterday sitting next to Emily and I think that probably would have been kind of hard for me 10 years ago,” she admits. They were wearing similar clothes, “and I would have made a joke about it before – but now it’s just – I just feel like that’s over. I kind of feel done with the self-ranking thing.”She says this comes from growing up and realising that she feels most beautiful when she’s away with her girls, or on a night out where she’s just “so happy, so comfortable, you know who you are. And then it’s like, well, why can’t we just feel like that all the time?” One of those girls is her best buddy Jennifer Lawrence. “I texted her yesterday and I was like, ‘I did an interview today and I told them you were really hideous up close.’ And she wrote, ‘Actual LOL’, and then she added in parenthesis ‘(Because I’m so pretty, you know?)’ And I was like, ‘Exactly.’” I ask about their shared sense of humour. “Well, Jen’s quick. She picks up on things that I just mutter to make myself laugh. I’ll just say something under my breath, and she’ll be like, ‘I heard that.’”Speaking of comic actors, Michelle Williams is an absolute revelation in I Feel Pretty. It’s perhaps the biggest shock of the film. “Me too,” says Schumer. “I didn’t know she was really funny. Like she’s really funny. Why didn’t we know? It’s because they always put her in some awful thing where she’s got to be on the floor, crying.”As for the #MeToo movement, Schumer wholly supports it but isn’t jumping up and down whooping about it “because, while it’s exciting, it’s also really triggering and upsetting. It makes everybody feel super vulnerable. But to think that this generation is going to say, ‘This isn’t acceptable,’ and not just bury the things that our mothers buried – that feels really good. It feels like, across the board, we’re getting closer to equality. Which is – it’s such a gut-wrenching thing to even have to say that.”She must have seen a few of her own male colleagues in comedy go down. “Right, there are people you love that can have really shitty behaviour that needs to be called out. And then there are so many men who are just scared, they’re just waiting for the phone to ring, they’re waiting to open their computer and see their faces and it’s a frightening time for them. But then we’re going, ‘We’ve been frightened our whole lives.’”As for the future, Schumer continues to campaign for gun control, aided by her distant cousin the US senator Chuck Schumer, and to call out certain other senators and their links to the NRA. It’s a subject even closer to her heart after two young women were shot in an American cinema while watching her movie Trainwreck. The day we meet, schoolkids are pouring out of their classrooms across the USA to demonstrate, “and I think once I start looking at that news footage I’ll just be crying all day,” she says. We discuss the Florida survivors, such as Emma Gonzalez. “These kids are really making an impact and I feel more hopeful right now than I thought possible,” she says. “This has been more movement than I thought that I would see in my lifetime. I think what they’re just realising is that the adults are not actually in control.”It’s also time for a change in Schumer’s own life. I ask about a typical day for her and she says that for the past 10 years, from the moment she woke up till she went to sleep, “I was driven and working and writing. Doing stand-up, you know, promoting something or filming something. I would say that, for 15 years, I was getting up at seven, going boxing, showering, going to the writer’s room all day, and having an interview during lunch. Afterward, maybe getting some sort of acupuncture before going and doing stand-up, and then having, like, 90 minutes when I could write when I got home. You know? That’s been it. I’ve been hustling for so long, I want to take care of myself now. I got really sick and it just made me realise I wasn’t invincible. I need to slow down.”One last thing though – can we just clear up the one-night-stand thing? Do you really mean you only had sex within relationships? “No! See to me, a one-night stand is where you meet someone that same day, you have sex with them, and then you never see them again. Sleeping with a friend or having sex with someone you know just once, no, I don’t consider that a one-night stand. I should make an addendum to that book. Something else I realised: I wrote that I don’t like watercress in the book. But I meant water chestnuts. So I need to publish two corrections, I guess.”I Feel Pretty is in cinemas in the UK and Ireland on 4 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f13b89976a34aa81fc0327b85ff92d42b60905a2/0_2575_4912_2948/master/4912.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f4583ec57941a1a2ea0ad6439cf9d3a","title":"life on a plate isabella rossellini farm chicken scorsese pasta","story":"The actor and farmer on her father’s pasta sauce, bee-keeping – and being fed by Martin Scorsese’s motherI live on a 21-acre farm in the countryside near Bellport, Long Island, and we have a lot of vegetables and a lot of eggs from rare heirloom chickens and there’s nothing like them. The taste of our carrots, which two minutes before were in the ground, is incredible. We’re a co-op so my eggs and honey are distributed to people on the farm. Bee-keeping is like raising Martians.Italy is basically an agricultural country with a climate and culinary tradition to match. In Italy, hardly anyone goes to the supermarket for food.My mother had a collection of utensils hanging on the wall, most of them sadly lost now. You’d take them if needed. I had dinner recently with someone who also had forks, knifes and spoons which you’d bring to the table in a box for guests to take from. I use that as an example of Swedish frugality, practicality and elegance.As a girl I had scoliosis, a deformity of the spine. I had casts and stretching operations and it went on and on. It was very painful and had many complications. I always hoped to be home because the food in hospital was very heavy and not good. I was immobile for about a year and lost weight. I remember people saying, “Try to eat, try to eat.”When I was 24 I was doing commercials for Rabarbaro Grappa, an Italian liqueur made out of rhubarb. When Nixon opened up China the company received their rhubarb from there. I travelled to China as a model and found this amazing rhubarb which was like a tree, which they used the root of for that liqueur. I was photographed next to this Chinese rhubarb, an absolutely huge rhubarb which dies out every year and then grows again.When I was married to Martin Scorsese his mother cooked most of the food.

We’ve been together for four years. I had a child when I was a teenager, and my partner has become an incredible father to him – yet suddenly the age gap between us feels problematic. He seems constantly on my case about “sorting things out”, whether it’s asking the school about upcoming exams or my manager how much holiday I’m owed. I am forgetful, so I don’t blame him for reminding me, but I’m not an assertive person and often when I speak to the school office, or my boss, or the council or any kind of authority I get fobbed off and wouldn’t even know how to argue.It’s got to the point where I dread him coming home from work, because he starts asking what progress I’ve made. But then I think he is right to hassle me, because these things do need to get done and I am an adult who ought to be capable of doing them. Perhaps I am unhappy because my life is a mess compared to his. It feels like his head is in paperwork and my head is in the clouds. I’m unhappy because he is trying to drag me down – and this is all that our relationship is now. How do we get happy again? Do I need to grow up, or does he need to loosen up?Mariella replies Both! That’s the short answer. There’s no more effective passion killer than responsibility – and we all struggle to incorporate both into our lives. It’s no wonder most epic romances play out before we hit 30, whether in pop songs, novels, films or real life, when the pressures of life have yet to assert themselves. Carefree behaviour relies on being carefree (or plain irresponsible) and few adults can lay claim to that halcyon state.You and your partner appear to have reached a serious juncture. He’s pushing you to grab the reins and you’re pushing against change to the status quo. It’s possible he’s a total killjoy, prematurely settling into pipe and slippers, or overly controlling, but I do wonder why you are so resistant to taking charge of your own destiny. In youth, evading chores is a challenge in adulthood it’s not a virtue. You can keep your head in the clouds only so long as someone else has their feet on the ground.It seems a particularly unjust ision of labour for your partner to be the one nagging you to check on your child’s school schedule. You know you need to step up to your responsibilities and stop conjuring excuses. The “age gap” between you is a particularly unconvincing argument as he’s probably equally unhappy about returning home from work to nag you about the basics of your own life. You may not want your relationship to boil down to such mundanities, but only by taking care of them can you clear the decks for the “happiness” you seek. School holidays, exam dates, domestic administration are tedious details essential to the infrastructure of our daily lives. Living in ignorance doesn’t make things go away. In fact, problems tend to expand while we’re dodging them.I’m wondering if you’re not just oppressed by minutiae but also a little bit depressed. Describing your life as a mess is an admission of powerlessness. Whether you and your partner stay together or not, it’s simply not an option to float along and expect things to simply work out or others to shoulder the responsibility. There comes a time in all our lives when we can no longer throw our hands up in the air in helplessness with any credibility. Saying that you’re forgetful, wouldn’t know how to argue and that you are not an assertive person isn’t acceptable justification for failing to tackle what needs doing.The challenge with getting together young is how much we alter and, when we’re older, how stuck in our ways we become. Although you sound like a recalcitrant child being forced into an adult lifestyle, I don’t think age is the issue here. Some people embrace administration with a relish, others are reluctant guests at that table. Clearly, and perhaps luckily for you, you hooked up with a responsible adult who likes life to be organised. I’m sure that was a blessing when you were a young single parent, but as you develop into maturity it may no longer seem such a gift. It is also not what you want the defining characteristic of your relationship to be.It is dispiriting how quickly romance can switch to mundanity, especially when there’s a child’s life to be organised, but if you both roll up your sleeves, establish your roles and get on with the chores it should be perfectly possible to carve out some time for joy. All work and no play may make Jack a dull boy, but the opposite would be even more tedious! There’s room for all sorts in this world, but playing to our strengths and teaming up to combat our weaknesses are essential survival skills.If there’s something more clinical at the heart of your inability to take control the best place to start is your GP. One of the clearest indications of depression is being stuck in a rut and I can’t decide whether it’s that, or a stubborn determination to keep to your comfort zone that’s causing your troubles. Working that out should be top of your list of tasks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43379626038618b12c598dbcab0764c2920af968/0_1358_4652_2789/master/4652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc3dfbe735255493ba8b0a86440ae23b","title":"nigel slater mussels langoustine and herring recipes","story":"For inspiration, nothing beats a trip to your local fish shopI found a list in an old notebook the other day, the pages yellowing, the faded pencil marks almost illegible. It was my wish list for a new house. Near the top, just underneath the obvious deal-breakers of “garden” and “kitchen large enough to eat in” was “in walking distance of a good fishmonger”. I have always lived close to a fish shop. The only time I didn’t was as a teenager, when the fish came round twice a week, like the bread, cakes and vegetables, in a white Bedford van. (We had a mobile library, too, that arrived with its little shelf of cookbooks on the first Wednesday of each month.)To this day, no food shopping quite excites me like the prospect of a sparkling ice-strewn slab of a fish shop. I am drawn to net bags of mussels, clams and cockles like a kid to a rock pool. Untidy piles of langoustines, all fine whiskers and fragile legs, dressed crabs and razor clams and ghostly white squid all unfailingly grab my attention. Langoustines are usually eaten with a bowl of basil mayonnaise, or split from head to tail and grilled with some sort of butter – lemon, tarragon, garlic.This week we made a bacon butter to melt over them with nuggets of crisp, smoked streaky. A recipe that got us all teasing out the snow-white flesh and salty juices with our tongues, snapping and sucking the toasted shells and licking our buttery fingers. A recipe that reminded me what a smart idea that little wish list had been.new potatoes 400ggarlic 1 whole, small headolive oil 50ml egg yolks 2lemon juice of half a small onemussels 400gsugar snap peas 150gwatercress (or land cress) a large handfulsalt and black pepperWash the potatoes, then place them in a steamer basket over boiling water. Tuck in the garlic, cover tightly with a lid, then leave over the heat for 15-20 minutes until the potatoes are tender. Remove from the heat, then slice them, a little thicker than a £1 coin, dropping them into a bowl as you go. Toss the potatoes in a trickle of olive oil, cover and set aside.Pop the garlic cloves from their skins, mash them to a paste using a pestle and mortar, then scrape into a mixing bowl. Stir in the egg yolks and then the lemon juice, a little at a time, mixing thoroughly. Beat in the olive oil and season with black pepper and a little salt.Check the mussels over, washing them in cold running water and discarding any broken shells or those that don’t close when tapped on the side of the sink.Tip the wet mussels into a medium saucepan, add a splash of water and place over a high heat. Cover tightly then let the mussels cook in their own steam for 3 or 4 minutes until the shells have opened.Remove from the heat then remove the mussels from their shells. Keep the shelled mussels in a bowl, moistened with a little of their cooking juices, covered with a plate.Slice the sugar snap peas in half and add to the mussels. Wash the watercress or land cress and shake it dry, then add to the mussels. Toss together the sliced potatoes, mussels and peas, cress and dressing and place on a serving dish.Make the butter first. Get the oven grill hot. Lay the bacon on a baking sheet and cook until very crisp, then drain on kitchen paper. Break the bacon into pieces and put them into a food processor. Add the dill and its stalks, then the butter and a little black pepper. You won’t need any salt. Process to a rough paste (over processing will make it oily).Cut the langoustines in half lengthways. Lay them on the baking sheet, cut side up and close together, then dot with lumps of the bacon butter.Cook the langoustines under the heat for about 6 minutes until the butter has melted and the surface is golden brown. Serve with halved lemons, and something to wipe your fingers on.A useful recipe for when you come across fresh herring. The pickled ginger slices through the oily notes of the fish, offering a warmth and gentle spice.

It took 54 years before the judges recognised music beyond the European classical tradition, making Wynton Marsalis’s Blood on the Fields the first jazz winner. There have only been two jazz winners since then (Ornette Coleman in 2007 and Henry Threadgill in 2016) and, until this year, nothing from the world of popular song. The prize has long been criticised as stuffy and irrelevant, with even 2003 winner John Adams saying it has “lost much of the prestige it still carries in other fields like literature and journalism”.By granting this year’s award to Kendrick Lamar’s album Damn, the Pulitzer board has gone from 0 to 60mph in a spectacular way.Damn is as groundbreaking a winner as was Bob Dylan’s Nobel prize for literature last year, though less of a philosophical conundrum. While even Dylan fans disagreed over whether songs qualified as literature, Damn is clearly excellent American music. The only rule broken by its win is the archaic, unspoken one that reserves the Pulitzer for supposedly higher artforms.So the only criticism that sticks is the fact that, unlike the two composers he beat, Lamar needs neither the publicity nor the $15,000 prize money. Damn, the US’s biggest-selling hip-hop album of 2017, has already taken home six MTV awards, five Grammys, NAACP Image Awards, a Brit, a Juno, a BET award and a Clio. But needing the award comes a poor second to deserving it.Lamar’s Pulitzer has been celebrated as a vindication of hip-hop, and a particularly sweet one given that Damn features a pointed sample of Geraldo Rivera on Fox News making the absurd claim that “hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years”. But, four decades after it evolved out of Bronx DJ culture, hip-hop is both critically adored and commercially supreme.When the biggest hit on Broadway is Hamilton, it doesn’t take a Pulitzer to grant the genre artistic legitimacy. Nor is it likely that rappers will suddenly dominate the Pulitzer, any more than folk-rock singer-songwriters will take over the Nobel for literature. The award says less about hip-hop at large than it does about Lamar’s exceptional place in American culture.The Pulitzer board starchily described Damn as “a virtuosic song collection, unified by its vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism that offers affecting vignettes capturing the complexity of modern African-American life”, all of which is true but could apply equally to Lamar’s previous two albums — he is currently enjoying a streak of commercial and critical success comparable to Stevie Wonder’s in the 1970s.Lamar’s 2012 major-label debut Good Kid, M.A.A.D City was the kind of cinematic coming of age story that most rappers spend the rest of their careers trying to live up to, but 2015’s To Pimp a Butterfly was something else entirely: a wildly original exploration of Lamar’s conflicted feelings about fame combined with a ferocious state-of-the-nation address, steeped in decades of soul, funk, hip-hop and jazz.Lamar was hailed as both the greatest rapper alive and the voice of black America under pressure, so nobody would have blamed him if his next full album had been a step down from that overwhelming masterpiece. Such extravagant praise has a tendency to derail artists, if not with complacency then with paralysing self-doubt.In fact, Damn, though shorter and more direct, is just as rich and audacious. Unless you count his occasionally phoned-in guest verses on pop hits, Lamar has yet to disappoint. Undoubtedly, Lamar’s cultural importance played a part in his Pulitzer win. In this hyper-political era of the Trump catastrophe and the unchecked police brutality that led to Black Lives Matter, there’s a particular excitement about works of art – Black Panther (for which Lamar produced the soundtrack), Get Out, Moonlight, Beyoncé’s Lemonade – which address blackness.But even if it weren’t a cultural phenomenon, Damn would be deserving on a compositional level. While there will always be those who flatly refuse to accept hip-hop as a valid artform, for everyone else Lamar represents the pinnacle of the form. His combination of technical virtuosity, moral complexity, political acuity, wit, empathy and musical depth and breadth makes him the only MC (sorry Kanye) who can unite teenage hip-hop fans, Golden Age aficionados and people who barely follow the genre.Raised in Compton, Los Angeles, Lamar, like many rappers, grew up amid poverty and gang violence. He continues to wrestle with survivor’s guilt and the moral responsibility that comes with success, constantly interrogating his own weaknesses and hypocrisies. When I interviewed him in 2015, he was hugely impressive in a low-key way: calm, reflective, deeply religious and wise beyond his years.He clearly took seriously the job of living up to expectations without ever being sanctimonious or didactic. “We all like to have fun,” he told me. “I like to have fun, too. But where do you stop and say, You know what? There’s actually some real shit going on out there that people can relate to more than any singalong I can bring to the table. It’s just about balance.“I don’t fault other artists. I don’t say this person should be doing that. As conscious as my music sounds, I would never point the finger because every day I make mistakes.”If Lamar’s work has a central theme, it’s human fallibility and contradiction: “I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA,” he raps on Damn’s most intense track, DNA. He uses sly charm, raspy belligerence, frantic rage, solemn introspection to express different sides to his personality.He is an extraordinarily vivid and unpredictable storyteller with a tendency to radically change his music, vocal tone and lyrical direction midway through a song, zooming in or out so that the second half complicates and subverts the first.Even when he’s riding one beat for four minutes, as he does on his hit single Humble, his lyrics contain multitudes. His technical brilliance is never self-regarding virtuosity but a means to an end: more clarity, more complexity, more honesty.The listener gets the impression that, rather than competing with other MCs, Lamar is driven by a burning desire to outdo himself.When Duke Ellington was controversially denied a Pulitzer in 1965, he responded: “Fate is being kind to me. Fate doesn’t want me to be too famous too young.” He was 67 at the time. Lamar is just 30, undaunted by fame, and more untouchable than any MC in the history of hip-hop. The Pulitzer is just the latest confirmation that he stands alone.HiiiPoWer, 2011Lamar aligns himself with a roll-call of black icons on this Kanye West-influenced highlight from his independent studio album Section.80.The Art of Peer Pressure, 2012This is a storytelling tour de force that speaks of crime, friendship and a very close shave, bringing Lamar’s dangerous adolescence to life.Alright, 2015From his album To Pimp a Butterfly, its defiant but qualified optimism, elevated by soul and jazz, made this an anthem for Black Lives Matter.The Blacker the Berry, 2015A ferocious expression of black pride and rage, which attacks first white America and then Lamar’s own hypocrisy.DNA, 2017Lamar’s unflinching self-analysis accelerates into a breathtaking frenzy, like sparks flying from an overheating brain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee07645167ffa02942a045980037b19c5184f922/298_374_3302_1981/master/3302.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8814aa8b5489dca3bd25d2270ff515","title":"avicii a life in pictures","story":"The death of the 28-year-old Swedish DJ and producer cuts short a globally successful career, filled with arena tours and big star collaborations"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0521c6ee9e24e677a8408ddfd88aa2cd448d7a7d/317_77_2723_1633/master/2723.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=085f15f5ae156fddad843d89280b99d4","title":"carwyn jones to step down as first minister of wales","story":"Jones tells Welsh Labour party conference he will stand down in autumnThe first minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, will stand down in the autumn.He made the surprise announcement at the Welsh Labour party conference in Llandudno on Saturday.Jones’s decision means Wales will have a new first minister at the start of December.He became first minister and leader of the Labour party in Wales in December 2009 – a decade after he was first elected to the Welsh assembly. The Welsh Labour leader had been under significant pressure since Carl Sargeant was found dead in early November, four days after being sacked as a minister over harassment allegations.This week, opposition parties in Wales criticised the Labour-led government for blocking the full publication of a report examining claims that Sargeant’s dismissal was leaked in the days before he killed himself.The Welsh Tories claimed during an assembly debate that it was morally wrong for the report not to be published.Jones’s decision to stand down comes a day after lawyers for Jack Sargeant, Carl’s son, wrote a strongly worded letter accusing him of causing considerable distress.An inquiry into how Jones handled the sacking has not yet begun. The letter said: “The inescapable fact here is that someone sadly lost their life, a much-loved family member, and due process must be followed expeditiously to enable those closest to him to find some closure.” Sargeant’s lawyer, Neil Hudgell told BBC Wales: “It’s a culmination of a series of frustrations over the delay to the start of the inquiry. Our thoughts very much are that it’s been dehumanised within the first minister’s office: there’s some game-playing going on and some deliberate stalling tactics.” When asked about the accusation his manner had caused distress, Jones said: “I can’t see how that can be the case.” In his speech on Saturday, the first minister paid tribute to his wife, Lisa, and their children, and thanked them for their support. “There are people I haven’t been fair to in recent times, and that’s my family,” he said.“In any normal political career you expect to be put through the wringer and have your everything challenged. I don’t think anyone can know what these last few months have been like, other than Lisa and the kids. They have helped me through the darkest of times. I have asked too much of them at times and it’s time for me think about what’s fair to them.”Jones told the Welsh Labour conference he was “incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved together so far”.Earlier on Saturday, Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris was elected as the party’s first deputy leader.Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood congratulated Jones on his nine years as first minister but said Wales not only needed a new leader but a new government. “Wales can and must be better than this – rearranging the deckchairs will not deliver the change we need,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ad020c63799424cdb6081308b93079cbcd4474e/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27917d9f6f94c129ca7f1a40d62591c0","title":"koji tsuruoka japan ambassador britain brexit single market","story":"Koji Tsuruoka expected a quiet posting in a stable country. Then Brexit happened. He tells the Observer of his fears and hopes for manufacturing, trade and investmentKoji Tsuruoka is sipping green tea in Japan’s splendid embassy in Mayfair, recalling how his first two years as Japan’s ambassador to the UK have not gone quite according to plan. At least, they haven’t turned out how his predecessors assured him they would. One after another, ex-ambassadors advised him, before he took up the position on 6 June 2016, that he would find the UK very “stable”, and its politics “very predictable”.A year later, after the Brexit bombshell caused global diplomatic and economic panic that reached Tokyo, Theresa May called a surprise general election that threw everything up in the air again. Thinking back to that period of turbulence, Tsuruoka stops for a few seconds and glances out of the window in the direction of Buckingham Palace. “Now I have to keep in mind that you don’t predict what is going to happen in the UK.”That said, he does quickly predict, in his diplomatic and soft-spoken way, that Brexit will bring considerable economic uncertainty to this country, in the short term at least. He spells out how decades of ever-increasing Japanese investment into the UK have already come to a halt for the time being. He is well qualified to judge how Brexit will pan out. Before coming to London, Tsuruoka spent three intense years negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that aims to reduce barriers between the US, Japan and 10 other Pacific nations. He knows as much as anyone about how international trade flows work, and about what is possible and what is not.This account of a relationship that strengthened year after year – in a period during which the UK was in the EU – raises a very obvious question. Will it continue to thrive after we have left? He replies decisively. “One thing I can say for certain, based on fact, is that the companies operating today in the UK are not expanding their investment in the UK today.”Huge Japanese firms with big plants in the UK – such as Nissan and Toyota, who sell most of their British-made cars into the EU – are, he says, treading water, biding their time before deciding whether to relocate part or all of their businesses, so they can continue to be based inside the single market after March 2019. He tries not to sound alarming, but is clear about the threat to UK jobs. “They are currently considering and thinking and watching very closely what they need to do. That is why they are not investing additionally today.“If you are proposing in your board meeting in a company that you need to invest more and build more cars in the UK today today there will be questions, and those are questions that are very difficult to answer today with certainty and therefore decisions are put off.”For Japanese enterprises which came to the UK to sell into EU markets, tariff-free trade is the guiding star that decides where they locate.“The reason that many of those companies have come is that this is the best gateway to Europe,” he says. “If that is in danger, if that is no longer sustainable, of course they will have to look at what they will have to do best. The existing arrangement for the single market is a total frictionless trade.”He believes membership of the single market is as good as it gets for Japanese firms wanting to sell into the EU from European bases. “The EU is a very exceptional single market. I don’t think the single market could be substituted by something and be better or even be the same.”It is not a uniform picture across the whole economy. There are sectors, such as software design, where the UK is still attractive, as it has the R\u0026ampD expertise and skills. He cites the example of how Japan’s SoftBank agreed, after the referendum, to buy the British software design firm Arm Holdings for £24.3bn in the hope that it would become a global leader.“That is one representation of what will go on and that was based on the assessment that the R\u0026ampD, the hi-tech capability, the potential for the UK succeeding further in this area, was quite concrete… those technologies are not necessarily linked to the EU.”Factory-based businesses, however – those producing goods for European markets rather than merely designing them – are a very “different issue”. They face real uncertainties if and when the terms of trade change. So too do Japanese financial institutions in the City, Japanese banks and other organisations offering financial services.The fact they will no longer have passporting rights to operate into EU markets will have significant effects on employment here. “It is an issue – because having passporting rights to reach the single market and be part of the single market is a very efficient and cost-saving way of conducting financial services which is a regulated industry.” Will Japanese banks up sticks and go? No, he says, not lock, stock and barrel, because Europe is just part of their market. But jobs will head out of the City into the EU and Japanese companies will have to reduce their operations in London. “They are not leaving London, because London is a global financial centre, not just a centre for the EU – but they will have to relocate some of their EU business to the EU in order to continue serving the EU consumers.”He is at pains not to talk down the UK’s post-Brexit prospects. Just as no one thought Brexit would happen when he arrived, no one can know for definite that it will turn out badly, as it approaches.“If you take a longer term, five, 10, 20 years… things become more unpredictable,” he says. But he is clear that in the shorter term it will not be good for the UK economy nor the strength of its economic partnership with Japan.He says Japan has not yet begun talks with the UK on a post-Brexit trade deal and that it would take several years to complete, if one is struck at all. It is another area of real uncertainty in the entirely unpredictable post-Brexit world that he never expected to encounter on arriving in London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee17e2273717f67beda3abae8fe170c1d197d072/0_131_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5e5e00bfe8141e8918947c0330e05db","title":"welsh finance minister mark drakeford carwyn jones","story":"Mark Drakeford thinking about campaign ‘very seriously’ following Jones’ decision to step downThe Welsh finance secretary, Mark Drakeford, has emerged as an early frontrunner to succeed Carwyn Jones as Welsh first minister.Jones said on Saturday he would step down in the autumn, having experienced “the darkest of times”. He has been under intense pressure since the Labour AM Carl Sargeant killed himself four days after being sacked as a minister over harassment allegations.Drakeford is experienced and well-respected with Welsh Labour. He won plaudits in his former job as health minister by defending the Cardiff administration against Tory attacks on its record on running the NHS in Wales.He is also a key figure in the Welsh government’s Brexit negotiations with the UK government.Asked if he would stand, Drakeford said he would think about it “very seriously”.Another possible candidate is Vaughan Gething, who five years ago became the first black minister in any of the devolved UK administrations.Whoever succeeds Jones will inherit an administration and party rocked by the death of Sargeant. The pressure on Jones increased last week when opposition parties in Wales criticised the Labour government for blocking the full publication of a report examining claims that Sargeant’s dismissal was leaked in the days before he killed himself.Jones’s announcement came a day after lawyers for Jack Sargeant, Carl’s son, published a letter accusing Jones of causing considerable distress, though it is not believe the letter prompted his decision to step down.The main inquiry into how Jones handled the sacking has not yet begun.On BBC Radio Wales’ Sunday Supplement, the Welsh government minister and independent AM Dafydd Elis-Thomas paid tribute to Jones and said he had “nothing but contempt” for people in Labour who had been “stirring it up”.Asked if there were people trying to undermine Jones, he said: “Of course.”Jones told the Welsh Labour conference on Saturday: “In any normal political career, you expect to be put through the wringer, and even have your integrity challenged. On the inquiry he said: “I intend – as I’ve always maintained – to be here to give every answer to every question. But I intend to stand down in the autumn, allowing for a new first minister to take their place by the end of this year. Jones’ departure means the loss of an excellent election campaign leader, who has guided Welsh Labour to a string of victories during his nine-year tenure.  Together with the Scottish nationalists, he has also played an important role in holding the UK government to account over Brexit.The method of electing the new leader will be controversial. Shortly before Jones announced he was stepping down, the Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris won the Welsh Labour deputy leadership election on an electoral college system – rather than one member, one vote. Her rival Julie Morgan, whose late husband Rhodri was first minister, was backed by more party members. As it stands, the new leader will also be elected under the same contentious system. The UK Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will address the conference in Llandudno, north Wales, on Sunday. Paying tribute to Jones, he said: “Carwyn has led Welsh Labour to achieve unprecedented electoral success, forming two Labour Welsh assembly governments.“Over the last nine years he has stood up to Tory austerity and stood up for the people of Wales as a strong voice for devolution and democracy.”Others possible replacements include Jeremy Miles, the counsel general for Wales, and Huw Irranca-Davies, who stood down as an MP in 2016 to stand for election to the Welsh assembly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6945ffb3984d6e78427ee3d3c07d2e842c75416e/46_200_3372_2023/master/3372.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=382553d20fce7688e55df8cf36fad7b5","title":"amir khan phil lo greco first round knockout","story":"Amir Khan made a blistering return to the ring by beating Phil Lo Greco by knockout inside 39 seconds at Liverpool’s Echo Arena.The 31-year-old had not fought for two years, since being beaten by Saul “Canelo” Álvarez in Las Vegas in May 2016, and he made up for lost time by knocking the Canadian Lo Greco down twice in the early stages.Khan, in his first bout on British soil since a points victory over Julio Diaz five years ago, sent Lo Greco to the canvas with a swift one-two combination inside the opening 30 seconds. The super-welterweight contest was over moments later as the Briton’s devastating hand speed pinned his opponent up against the ropes to ensure it was over moments after it had started.It meant Khan delivered an emphatic statement to Kell Brook, who was watching on from ringside, before a possible all-British grudge match between the two Matchroom stablemates.This was the first of a three-fight deal Khan had signed with Eddie Hearn and his promoter had conceded his fighter could not afford a fifth defeat on his record.That never looked likely and there was no evidence of any ring rust from Khan either after he changed to the trainer Joe Goossen in the buildup to this bout. Lo Greco appeared stunned by Khan’s sheer speed from the outset and, as soon as he dropped him with a right hand, it looked like a foregone conclusion.There was an eight count on that occasion and moments after the two squared off again, a flurry of left hands from Khan ended it all.Khan first came to prominence when he won a silver medal in the lightweight ision at the 2004 Olympics, thus becoming Britain’s youngest boxing Olympic medallist at 17. He won the WBA light-welterweight title in 2009 and the IBF title in 2011. His professional record is 34 wins (20 by knockout) and four defeats.After the fight Khan said: “I’ve been out of the ring for two years. I’ve never taken a day off the gym. I’ve had a hand operation and the hand felt good in the fight.“People just wanted to see me come back and I wanted to prove a point and come back. I’m two years out of the ring but I’m back with a big bang.”When asked if he is targeting a fight against Brook, Khan said: “I want to become a world champion again so I want to fight the top guys in the welterweight ision. I’m a 147lb fighter. I moved up to 150lb for this fight because I’ve not been in the ring for two years. That fight I’m not rushing and I’m not running away from.“I will fight Kell Brook and I will beat Kell Brook. I’m a better fighter and a stronger fighter.”Brook responded by telling Khan he would make him see stars – a reference to Khan’s appearance in last year’s I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! “Amir, all the fans want the fight, I want the fight,” Brook said. “He can go in the jungle and chase stars but when he gets in there with me, I’ll make him see stars.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/353b2aac8fa92640d3d324ec3a709049690111bb/0_154_3488_2094/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f897b351457303b434bbb573bcb8c03b","title":"county cricket yorkshire v notts somerset v worcs and more live","story":"We are set for a start at Headingley, 20 minutes late, although play will commence under floodlights.

This third morning could bring a century for Gary Ballance, who resumes on 76 with his side leading by 257 in their second innings at 1894.At Chelmsford, Essex are also in a strong position having set Lancashire a target of 320. Interesting overnight quotes from James Foster, however: “I’m not sure if it’s going to be a winning total. I think it’s a good score, but I still feel we have to bowl exceptionally well.

He posted one on his last appearance for Yorkshire against Surrey last September. He was an option to return to Headingley before Glamorgan offered him a two-year contract, with the length of deal significant. Sussex and Leicestershire are in the midst of a high-scoring contest at Grace Road, including a century for Sussex’s Michael Burgess on his return to his former stomping ground and a maiden career half-century for Ishant Sharma. Leicester will begin on 1122 in reply to 4388 declared.Finally, at Wantage Road, Northants have work to do to avoid defeat against Warwickshire. They will resume their second innings on 410, trailing by 225. After a disappointing summer last year, their are positive signs for the Bears, with a first-innings century for Tim Ambrose.

She had plenty left there, and has a better time in her, that’s for sure. She raises her arms but then starts coughing she’s good.  2:15:25, Paula Radcliffe’s record is already safe and then some, as Cheruiyot paces down the Mall. Dibaba is still jogging, but dropping. Cheruiyot is still pumping, looking set for around 2.18 which would be a personal best by five minutes she leads by a minute twenty or so. Keitany is now fourth. Laso of Spain avenges his Paralympic defeat, gassing away from Chentouf down the Mall to win. In the men’s it’s Kipchoge and Kitata well clear now. The former is piling it on, stoking and stoking, enjoying the frankly unfathomable pain he’s experiencing and inflicting. Cheruiyot is gritting her teeth and plodding through. She’s really close here, but is having the inverse of fun. Kipchoge has surged so Farah has dropped and is dropping, but Kitata is haning on. Cheruiyot has a look behind, but there’s nowt to be seen! She’s on her bill, and is easing to victory. She won the 5000m in Rio and got silver in the 10 she’s not as great a mover as Keitany, but she’s assessed things very nicely here. Karoki is is just behind the leaders, but Wanjiru, last year’s winner, has also gone. The pace has slowed, it seems, which might explain Farah’s progress, but Kirui and Bekele have lost touch!Kipchoge still leads the men, but Farah is now alongside! Kitata is with them too, and they’re maybe 10m ahead of the next few. Cheruiyot bouts past Keitany! She takes her out easily, and there’s no effort at a fightback, Keitany diddled herself going for the record, and is beaten! Keitany is at 1.54:36 at 35km ... and Cheruiyot and 12 seconds behind, with 25 minutes’ worth of running left! Is she now the favourite?! If Keitany doesn’t have anything left, she might not even get second. We’re back to hang with Keitany, while behind her, Vivian Cheruiyot, a great of the track, is starting to catch her up! Kipchoge is making damn sure to stay on the blue line so he doesn’t have to run a single unnecessary step - he seems to have told the pacemaker to chill. The leading group is now strung out, with Farah at the rear. Kipchoge at 1.01:00 at halfway. The record is 2.02:57, so even allowing for some downhill at the start, this is looking very smart indeed. The leading men whizz across Tower Bridge, Tower of London to their left. There are eight of them I think, Farah at the back, and they’re through 20km in roughly 2.02, well inside world record pace. She tries a gentle plod, but the greatest 10,000m runner ever is struggling. But now she goes off again! She stops! She walks! Oh-oh! Dibaba has stopped! She’s holding her leg, she’s overtaken by the second group, and now she’s back going again. But she’s not catching the second group I don’t think, so that might be her. Farah is now up with Kipchoge and the boyz. He’s looking around the others are not. Keitany is grinding, 1.37:03 at 30km. She’s 52s ahead of Dibaba, but is slowing. Perhaps she’s taking a breather - ok a “breather” - before coming again. But either way, she’s on for a lifetime best, though it’s beginning to look good for Paula Radcliffe and her record. Keitany is looking focused, which us to say things might be starting to hurt. They’ve got about eight miles left. The men are still inside 2.02 pace. Alright lads, we’ve all had a few. BREAKING: Farah has collected his own drink I say Farah has collected his own drink. BREAKING: Farah missed a water station, not his own special drink. He’s got to wait a mile to resolve that more news as I get it.Kipchoge is 43:05 at 15km. Farah is alongside Bekele, but just failed to collect a bevvy, while Kipchoge is moving as beautifully as he does. Kirui is comfy too, and this is shaping up to be a serious race. Back we go to the elite women, and Keitany has slowed. She’s just about on world record pace, but who knows what she’s got left with 17km to go. Dibaba is still moving well enough, but will have to go some to compete for the lead. Best known for her work on the track, she is now a fully-fledged all-rounder! She maintained her metre lead all the way down the stretch, and there was nowt McFadden could do about it! De Rozario of Australia, the Commonwealth champ, pulls away! De Rozario and McFadden are pulling away! The women’s wheelchair race is gearing up for a five-way sprint down the Mall. McFadden was injured last term so lost her title to Schar, and those two are favourites but De Rozario is in front and not to be messed with. Farah is getting ticked off by Rob Palmer for wasting energy. Maybe it’s good to get him going. Farah is in a row with a cameraman, giving him a proper telling for something or other. He gets angry! Keitany is still putting it in hard. She is phenomenal, on course at halfway at 67.16. Dibaba is 23 seconds behind, also on course for the record, which tells you that it is in danger, not just of being beaten but of being taking to Sketchley. Weir looks really happy. He’s at peace with himself and, having quit the track, with his racing. He is an exceptional human being. What a finish that was! Romanczuk moves aside, and here comes Weir! Hug, the Silver Bullet, can’t compete! This looked like it was going to be tight, it is tight, but there’s no doubt at all who’s going to lead them home! The wheelchair race is still close Hug, Weir are led by Romanczuk as they come round onto the Mall!Farah’s lifetime best is five minutes down on some in the field, but it’s noted in commentary, as it was with Dibaba, that you don’t want to run a marathon on your bill.

Such wanton gunplay takes no regard of possible casualties, of which the first, predictably, has again been the wellbeing of the English language.Exhibit A. Consider the following from Mark Darbon, the recently appointed chief executive of Northampton rugby club, which, until last week’s defeat of Leicester, had been playing like drains. When asked about the club’s, ahem, form, he said: “Have we found a silver bullet for success that guarantees success for next season and beyond? I hope so.”Further exhibits from the past week, in no particular order, include the following headlines: “A new medical school in Sunderland is not a silver bullet” “Silver bullet solutions to citrus greening are unlikely” “Active share can be useful, but it’s not a silver bullet” “Zoning is no ‘silver bullet’ to speeding up housebuilding”.Wrong, wrong and wrong again. What these journalists are looking for is the word “magic” before bullet. Magic bullet: “Drug that is capable of destroying bacteria, cancer cells, etc, without adversely affecting the host.” Silver bullets are useful only for dispatching werewolves, although given the alacrity with which said rounds are being indiscriminately loosed off, is it any wonder that these creatures are so rarely spotted these days, cut down in a murderous crossfire of trigger-happy language use?Meanwhile, over in the anthropomorphic land that is Countryfile, a group of seals was described as “chilling out on the beach”. No they weren’t, they were doing what seals usually do, which, frankly, isn’t very\u0026nbspmuch, at the best of times.To a far happier advent. I am indebted to Irwin Stelzer for dropping a new word in my lap: “A worried Trump is turning to rescission to placate deficit hawks.” I now know that rescission means the revocation, cancellation or repeal of a law, order or agreement, but it is a word I’ve never, sadly, come across before.

The only sounds are a skylark’s song, the amorous grunting of hidden toads and the occasional distant drum-drum of a high-speed train.Beyond stretches a vast plain of hedgeless fields, green and then black, where the plough reveals dark peat soil. There is no sign of the sea but Britain’s newest footpath is a coast path of the future – and the past.The Fen Edge Trail is an illuminating new route through an overlooked landscape that is weirder than any other, and becoming wilder once again. The path is being devised by a band of enthusiasts from Cambridge Geological Society to follow the five-metre contour on maps around the great flatlands of the Fens. Three thousand years ago, this wiggly line was the coast it may become coast again rather sooner, as climate warming brings further rises in sea levels.The trail is a grassroots project involving local heritage and wildlife groups. Downloadable guides to the first sections are published this spring, with Peterborough to St Ives in Cambridgeshire available by the summer. It will take a little longer to map (or walk) the whole 280-mile semi-circle of fen edge from the Suffolk border to Lincolnshire.I set out from Horsey Bridge, south-east Peterborough (where Whittlesey Road meets Milk and Water Drove) to explore the fen edge to Ramsey (about 10 miles south as the crow flies, but 22 miles on the wriggly contour path), with ersions into Holme Fen and Woodwalton Fen. These historic nature reserves – Woodwalton was saved by the banker and naturalist Charles Rothschild, one of the founders of the “nature reserve” concept a century ago – are being connected by the Great Fen project project, an ambitious mission to restore a swath of lost wetlands that were drained for agriculture in the 19th century.My long day’s walk takes in the lowest land in Britain (2.7 metres below sea level), a lost lake and our largest lowland birch woodland. The discombobulating Fenland landscape of crooked telegraph poles, lumpy lanes and wonky houses – a consistent unevenness caused by the rapidly shrinking peat soils – seems to guarantee out-of-the-ordinary experiences: at one point, two ponies-and-traps trot past driven by primary school-age boys later, I’m asked if I can help lift a washing-machine by a bloke who turns out to be an acclaimed actor.Leaving the suburbs of Peterborough behind, the footpath follows the old course of the River Nene to the village of Farcet (pronounced Fasset). A 15-minute ersion takes me to a late-Victorian chapel in Farcet’s old cemetery. This is the Fenland Trust’s Fen View Heritage Centre, which opens this spring. It’s rich in local history and houses the last remaining leg irons from Britain’s first purpose-built prisoner-of-war camp, which held 6,000 French soldiers from the Napoleonic wars of 1797–1815. Outside, the cemetery may be only 19 metres above sea level but a little elevation goes a long way in a landscape of horizontals, and the views south are spectacular.This expanse of flat land brings to mind an inland sea, which it was until much more recently than the bronze age. Much of these fields were once Whittlesey Mere, until 1851 the largest lake in lowland Britain. This lake had two ports, was a source of fish, reeds for thatch and wildfowl for fashionable London restaurants. It was also a playground for pleasure boats and, when the brutal Fenland frosts froze its waters, an arena for speed-skating and ice yachting – sailing boats on skates.The lake disappeared shortly after the Great Exhibition of 1851, when a local landowner acquired a powerful new pump from the mechanical marvels on show, brought it home and drained the lake. This landscape revolution saw the spectacular large copper butterfly become extinct and ushered in a century-and-a-half of increasingly intensive farming, exploiting the fertility of the lakebed and the surrounding Fenland peat.An epicentre for onion farming – root crops grow well on the light soil – might seem like the nadir of a wild adventure but these fens are becoming wilder once again. South of Yaxley is the national nature reserve of Holme Fen. Here stand the Holme Fen posts: one is an iron column reputedly taken from the Great Exhibition and pushed into the ground by the engineers draining Whittlesey Mere. They guessed that the peaty soil would dry out and shrink and they were correct: in the first decade after draining the lake, the ground dropped away from the posts by 1.44 metres. Today, the top of the posts – 1851 ground level – stand 4 metres above where I stand.The Fens are losing up to 2cm of soil each year, particularly in spring when ploughed fields dry out and winds cause the infamous “Fen blow” – a bizarre black miasma of airborne peat. In many places its fertile peat layer is only a metre or two deep. “It’s a finite resource,” says Henry Stanier of the Great Fen project. “Farming it in the current way will result in its disappearance.”Stanier shows me around Holme and Woodwalton fens. For a century, these two nature reserves were tiny islands of wetland surrounded by drained fens. As the peat shrank, so these wetlands dried out, and Woodwalton Fen lost its populations of rare butterflies, dragonflies and marshland birds. I’m surprised to learn that the high floodbanks around Woodwalton don’t keep the water out but keep it in – stopping the fen from completely drying out.The first step in this epic restoration project involves turning arable fields to grassland, which locks in the remaining peat. On the former bed of Whittlesey Mere, new small meres are being created, scraped into the earth or “rewetted” from underneath – slowly allowing more water in via sluices and drains. Reedbeds are forming naturally, and rare marshland birds, from the bearded tit to the bittern, are recolonising the region. “It’s just getting to a really exciting stage,” says Stanier. “We’ve got the water levels up and things are starting to appear.” Last summer, seven cuckoos called at Engine Farm – named after the pump which first removed the water – while 16 short-eared owls patrolled the area. But the great lake will never return. Ironically, Whittlesey Mere cannot be recreated because, in many places, its bed is now higher than the surrounding farmland: the lake’s silt has shrunk less than the peat on surrounding farmland.The new meres shine brilliant blue beneath a cloudless spring sky, and Stanier points out several Chinese water deer, dainty, fanged animals with bat-like ears which dwell in wetlands and made their home in this part of the world in the 1970s, after escaping captivity. Before lunch in the Admiral Wells, Britain’s lowest pub, we visit Engine Farm, where lie huge square hunks of the local Barnack limestone. These great blocks were destined to build Ely Cathedral or Ramsey Abbey but fell to the bottom of Whittlesey Mere when the boat that was transporting them ran into difficulties.After lunch, I take the lanes past pretty Conington church and walk into what Christine Donnelly of Cambridge Geological Society calls “the uplands”. Donnelly is one of the enthusiasts developing the Fen Edge Trail and a great advocate for the region’s subtle geology: the fen edge is surprisingly undulating, thanks to deposits of oxford clay. Usually a feature of valley bottoms, here the clay forms the hills. It’s the reason for Peterborough’s historic brickworks, and a rich source of Jurassic fossils.The route skirts pretty woodland edges filled with bridal white blackthorn and bumblebees from Riddy Wood to Lady’s Wood, known for its spectacular carpet of bluebells in spring. I follow deer tracks in the clay as the chiffchaffs sing, admiring the purple-and-silver of Woodwalton Fen’s birch woodland in the distance.Unfortunately, it’s not easy to dip into Woodwalton Fen on foot (the only route there is a fast road), so the Fen Edge Trail meanders from the village of Upwood east to the historic town of Ramsey, built on what was once a shingle island. I get a lift to Woodwalton Fen, where I end the day watching toads grappling with each other in a dyke, as more red kites sail overhead. Somewhere in the reedbeds, there’s a male bittern his blowing-on-a-milk-bottle call is a spring sound just as rich and strange as this constantly surprising landscape.• More details of the routes at fenedgetrail.org.

They are the anchors of funfair rides, feature in extravagant floral tributes to the country’s “dear” and “supreme” leaders from the Kim dynasty, and appear on stamps, apartment buildings and school walls.These celebrations of the country’s weapons programme serve as a constant reminder to residents and visitors of how critical North Korea’s nuclear project has been to its national identity and security.Pursued at immense political and financial cost for more than six decades, even through a famine that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, it has proved useful leverage for wringing aid out of world powers, and an increasingly vital security guarantee for a brutal, autocratic regime.So the unilateral promise by the leader Kim Jong-un to halt tests of nuclear warheads and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and shut down the country’s nuclear test site, was an unexpected commitment that has added to hopes for talks with US and South Korean counterparts.It capped months of dramatic diplomacy that have seen Kim and Donald Trump pivot from trading belligerent threats to planning their summit and claiming a shared goal of getting rid of nuclear weapons.But experts on North Korea warned that Kim’s statement should be seen more as diplomatic manoeuvring, with relatively limited real costs to Pyongyang, than as a prelude to any genuine moves to gut the prized nuclear programme.Kim is under huge pressure. For the first time in decades North Korea may actually fear an American military attack, and its fragile economy is at huge risk from the strictest sanctions it has ever faced.Even on a carefully choreographed tour of the capital, long-standing shortages and privations are clear. A handful of cars and buses drift down vast empty streets, solar panels hanging from windows and balconies are testimony to regular power cuts.Kim needs trade to start flowing again, to fill his government coffers and the purses of supporters now grown used to moderate luxuries such as designer handbags, foreign whiskey and taxis to whisk them across town.He may be willing to make some genuine concessions for this an improvement on past talks where Pyongyang has blustered and ultimately offered little more than a return to the status quo. But they will not include America’s stated aim – the total and irreversible destruction of the nuclear programme. The fate of other dictators who confronted America, but gave up weapons programmes, including Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, has not gone unnoticed.“People like to talk about North Korea as ‘crazy’. The absolute ‘craziest’ thing they could do is give up their nuclear deterrent in a situation where they have an aggressive nuclear-armed enemy,” Alex Wellerstein, a historian of science and nuclear weapons and a professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology, said. “Does anyone think they are that crazy? I don’t,” he added.Pyongyang’s aims were still unclear he said, but could include stalling to defuse tensions, seeking recognition from America that it has long felt it deserves, or negotiating to reduce sanctions.For now, though, Kim appears focused on making it through the summits. For weeks there have been questions on both sides of the Pacific about whether the meeting with Trump in particular would actually go ahead. It is apparently so sensitive that it has not been reported in North Korean state media. But the CIA chief Mike Pompeo’s visit to Pyongyang, for personal meetings with Kim two weeks ago, appears to have brought a sometimes improbable meeting one step closer to reality.The two men appear to have outlined a deal of sorts that would give both sides grounds to claim success even if little real progress is made on removing Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal, the Wall Street Journal reported. Effectively it would see Kim swap the three Americans in his jails for the prestige of meeting the US president, something North Korean leaders have craved for decades.The Americans are academics at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, which was founded by a Korean-American Christian, and a businessman charged with spying and stealing state secrets in 2016 – the 62-year-old was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour.That agreement, and Pyongyang’s apparent show of goodwill over weapons testing, appear to make the high-profile summit more likely. But details still have to be hammered out. North Korea has agreed to constraints on its nuclear programme before and then backed away from commitments.In 2011, Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, spent the last weeks of his life negotiating a secret agreement with the US to trade food aid for a suspension of missile testing and uranium enrichment. It was sealed on 29 February, after his death, by his son and successor, and dubbed the “Leap Day” deal because of the date.Greeted with enthusiasm, within weeks it was effectively torn up. Kim’s government planned a satellite launch, insisting it was for peaceful purposes, but America disputed the claim, said Van Jackson, a former US official who at the time was working for the secretary of defence.“The United States made clear that space-launched vehicles, satellite-launched vehicles, cannot be considered anything but a missile test,” he told US National Public Radio.The stillborn deal has hovered over attempts to deal with North Korea, seen by some as evidence of the regime’s unscrupulous approach to manipulating western concerns.And while the statement from Pyongyang was dramatic, it may contain fewer concessions than the headlines suggest. Kim has completed his nuclear programme, so although his arsenal may be small and slightly unreliable, he doesn’t need further testing to use it as a deterrent.Abandoning nuclear tests and the country’s test site may just be strategic packaging of a geographical inevitability, after the Punggye-ri nuclear test site was probably damaged by September’s very large explosion. Tunnels caved in, Reuters reported, making it hard to use for any future test without risk of radioactive pollution seeping out.It also had omissions likely to worry regional powers who have always made more likely targets than the United States. “North Korea notably made no promises about intermediate or short-range missiles,” said Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate in the East Asia Nonproliferation Program. That leaves Japan and South Korea firmly within range.Even if North Korea did suggest it might give up weapons, it would be extremely hard to monitor in a country reluctant to loosen its tight grip on information and access. “North Korea has its own uranium mining operations. It has cavernous, secret underground storage and production, lots of scientists with experience of making nuclear weapons,” said Peter Ward, a North Korea researcher at Seoul National University. “Tell me how denuclearisation can be ‘complete, verifiable, and irreversible’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f4d4f8dea2f2b702a36ed4b582a9180a99b429c/0_454_3867_2320/master/3867.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=865fe58a302591139f39ef6378ff6a36","title":"identity checks election disenfranchise ethnic minorities","story":"New rules ‘will deter migrant voters’, watchdog claims, adding to Windrush scandalGovernment plans that will force people to prove their identities at polling stations in May’s local elections risk disenfranchising members of ethnic minority communities, according to a leaked letter to ministers from the equality and human rights watchdog.In a move that will fuel controversy over the treatment of migrants in the UK following the Windrush scandal, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has written to the Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, raising its serious concern that the checks will deter immigrants and others from participating in the democratic process.The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the plan for compulsory checks was more evidence of the kind of “hostile environment” that Theresa May’s government wanted to create for people who had come to settle in Britain. In a speech on Sunday, Corbyn will claim that Theresa May’s determination to cut immigration at all costs was responsible for the Windrush scandal. He will say: “British citizens who came to our country to rebuild it after the war have faced deportation because they couldn’t clear the deliberately unreachable bar set by Theresa May’s ‘hostile environment’ for migrants.”Under the new government voting rules, being trialled in several local authorities at the 3 May local elections, people will be asked at polling stations to produce documents proving their identity – such as a passport or driving licence – before casting their vote. Currently, no such proof is required.The Windrush scandal has highlighted how many who came to this country from the Caribbean, mainly in the late 1950s, have struggled to prove their British citizenship because the authorities failed to register them or destroyed their landing cards, or because they have never applied for documents such as passports.Ministers say the pilot projects are being run – with a view to adopting them nationwide if they are successful – in response to concerns about electoral fraud.But in a letter to Lidington, and leaked to the Observer, the EHRC says evidence of supposed fraud is minimal and warns that there is a real risk that legal residents who might not have a passport or driving licence – or might be reluctant to produce them at polling stations – could be disenfranchised as a result.In the letter, the EHRC’s legal officer, Claire Collier, tells Lidington: “The Commission is concerned that the requirement to produce identification at the given local elections (Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking) will have a disproportionate impact on voters with protected characteristics, particularly older people, transgender people, people with disabilities andor those from ethnic minority communities. In essence, there is a concern that some voters will be disenfranchised as a result of restrictive identification requirements.”Reacting to the news, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “Forcing voters at election time to prove their identity at polling stations by producing official documents would have a disproportionate impact on people from black and ethnic minority communities.“It is the same hostile environment all over again, shutting our fellow citizens out of public life, treating communities who made Britain their home as second-class citizens. It’s disgraceful and it must be brought to an end.”Kunle Olulode, the director of Voice4Change England, a civil society charity that has worked with the government to improve the participation of BME communities in elections said: “We feel strongly that this type of policy will not only have minimal impact on the miniscule level of voting fraud but will create potentially new and unnecessary barriers to participation in the electoral process if people become uncertain of requirements when they turn up at polling stations, further impacting negatively on registrations. Asking for voters IDs as a policy certainly has echoes of the strategy aimed at making society an uncomfortable place for illegal migrants.”A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “We already ask that people prove who they are in order to collect a parcel from the post office, rent a car, or travel abroad.“We believe it is right to take the same approach to protect voting rights. Local authorities are implementing equality impact assessments and are working with partners to ensure that voter ID does not risk preventing any eligible voter from voting. It is in nobody’s interest that any elector is disenfranchised.”Last night John Sentamu, the archbishop of York, called for an inquiry into immigration policy and the Windrush scandal in which up to 50,000 mostly Commonwealth migrants are facing problems securing their citizenship, access to healthcare and other services because of Home Office demands to see proof of their rights to be here.“The truth is now out. Hard-working, tax-paying immigrants who were invited to this country to help with postwar reconstruction have been treated appallingly,” he told the Observer. “It is never too late to repent, but it is unwise for penitents to boast about their achievements. Instead, the government needs to set up an inquiry urgently to discover where other aspects of our immigration policy are treating people as less than human.”It has also emerged that the “hostile environment” for illegal immigrants was implemented despite warnings from a Tory cabinet minister that it would lead to exploitation and endanger health.Investigations show that the plan to force landlords to check the immigration status of tenants, known as the “right to rent”, was fiercely opposed before its implementation by Eric Pickles, the former communities secretary. In an internal memo written in February 2013, he warned: “It would be disproportionately burdensome, ineffective and intrusive to oblige all private landlords to satisfy themselves as to the immigration status of prospective tenants. It’s hard to assess how many illegal immigrants this policy would deter in practice as it would be easy to circumventevade detection.“Those landlordsagents who are already rogues will not obey the law – and will make more money by exploiting a niche market in illegal tenants by increasing rentscompromising on health and safety for tenants who cannot complain ... The costs and risks considerably outweigh the benefits.”Amber Rudd, the home secretary, appeared to blame her department for the Windrush scandal last week, saying: “The Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual”.However, Brodie Clark, the former head of the UK Borders Agency who resigned after being criticised by May in 2011 for relaxing passport checks to reduce immigration queues, condemned the decision to blame officials and pointed to a “political desperation” to reduce immigration.“In my time with UKBA, I had the greatest regard for frontline staff and their ability to do their jobs effectively,” he said. “They saw their job as defending the country, but doing it in a fair and decent fashion.”“To hear any political leader now saying, ‘The trouble is, they were too obsessed in delivering policy and not enough about caring for people’, just beggars belief. Civil servants are employed to deliver government policy and deviation is certainly not rewarded. It is a shameful shot, given the dedication, commitment and skill of those staff.”The National Landlords Association, the Residential Landlords Association and the lettings agents’ body ARLA Propertymark are all pushing for the “right to rent” policy to be dropped amid warnings that it is causing landlords to discriminate against people with foreign names or non-UK passports. The policy was piloted from December 2014 and rolled out across England in February 2016.A Downing Street spokesman said: “It was a Labour government which, in 2008, introduced the labour market test so that people had to evidence their status. And it is fair that only those who have a right to be here can work legally, rent property and access public services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b263ce5460dc8295786110cfb395c956d9040c/0_164_3496_2097/master/3496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4edb07246c5164ee06849d9218b52961","title":"israel celebrates tensions iran new heights","story":"There were fireworks, concerts, torch processions and parties throughout the country. In Jerusalem the night sky was illuminated by 300 drones that coalesced to form images of favourite Israeli symbols, such as the national flag and a dove with an olive branch in its mouth. The celebrations included a live, televised retelling of Jewish history dating to biblical times. In one scene children with yellow stars pinned to their clothes fled marching Nazi soldiers. Another showed pioneers building the fledgling Jewish state.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, helped lead the national extravaganza, despite objections that his presence contradicted the event’s traditional, non-political character. This moment – the 70th anniversary last Wednesday of Israel’s independence, according to the Hebrew calendar – marked the country’s emergence as a rising world power, he declared.Israel offered the hand of friendship to all, Netanyahu said. But there should be no doubt, Israel was here to stay: “In another 70 years you’ll find here a country that is 70 times stronger, because what we’ve done until today is just the beginning!” Israel’s ability to protect itself was “the essence” of independence, he said.If Netanyahu sounded defensive, he had reason. Israel has faced many crises since its birth in 1948, including wars in 1967 and 1973, conflicts in Lebanon, and endless confrontation with the Palestinians, for whom Israel’s independence is known as the Nakba (“the catastrophe” or “cataclysm”). It was the day 700,000 people lost what they considered their homeland. Palestinians were not partying last week.Yet according to Israeli and regional experts, the storm now gathering around Israel’s borders potentially surpasses in severity anything the country has faced throughout its short and difficult history. Whichever way you look, in any direction, trouble looms. At its heart, connecting all the geopolitical Scrabble pieces, is one four-letter word: Iran.In Syria beyond the Golan Heights, in Lebanon to the north, in Gaza to the south, in Iraq, and possibly even in Jordan to the east, Israeli leaders are watching with growing alarm as Iran’s physical and ideological presence and influence steadily spread.Iran’s theocratic Shia Muslim regime has sworn to destroy the state of Israel – an oft-stated aim Israelis say cannot be dismissed as mere rhetoric. And Iran is edging closer day by day. The growing military strength of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its Quds Force and associated Shia militias in Syria, where with Russia they have played a key role in bolstering Bashar al-Assad’s regime, is the focus of Israeli concern.“They’ve succeeded in the war for Assad to survive. Now their first priority has changed and Israel is the target,” retired Major General Yaakov Amidror, Netanyahu’s national security adviser from 2011 to 2013, told the Wall Street Journal. “For us it is essential to stop Iran and for that we are ready to take the risk of a war.”Allowing Tehran to solidify its military presence in Syria would be akin to “agreeing to the Iranians placing a noose around our necks,” Avigdor Lieberman, Israel’s hawkish defence minister, has warned.Expressing what appears to be the consensus view, Mark Sofer, Israel’s ambassador to Australia, was blunt: “Iran cannot stay in Syria, period. We’re not going to have them on the border … Our position is clear, they have to get out and go home.”Writing in Foreign Policy magazine, Dov Zakheim, the former US undersecretary of defence, said the Israelis feared both Iranian consolidation and Russian interference in their operations. “Coupled with Hezbollah’s growing strength, and the weekly Hamas-inspired protests in Gaza, Israel faces the spectre of a three-front war for the first time since 1967.” Zakheim also warned of a possible future Iranian-inspired insurrection in Jordan, similar to what he said Tehran had been attempting in Bahrain.Iran’s intentions remain opaque. Politicians, officials and state media regularly threaten Israel’s annihilation. And it is indisputable that Tehran has extended its regional reach in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen, where Tehran backs rebel forces opposed to Saudi Arabia. But it insists its stance is defensive.In a speech in February, celebrating the 1979 revolution that toppled the shah, Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s cautious president, called for unity in the face of what he called “Israeli plots”. Hundreds of thousands of supporters in Tehran’s Azadi Square chanted the traditional slogans, “Death to the United States” and “Death to Israel”.But, like Israel, Iran is politically ided. How much of this is ritual and how much settled policy is unclear. What does seem plain is that Rouhani and the IRGC commander, Major General Qassem Soleimani, have competing agendas.Again, not unlike Israel, Iran feels surrounded. Maps of the Middle East show a country ringed by US military bases from Turkey to Bahrain to Afghanistan. Then again, Iran’s principal opponent is arguably not Israel at all but the US-aligned Saudi Arabia, the self-appointed leader of the Sunni Muslim Arab world.In backing Assad, some analysts believe, Iran’s aim is to ensure Syria does not slip into the pro-western “enemy” column, rather than to recreate the Persian empire or push Israel into the sea – or so the argument goes.Latest events on the ground undermine this. In recent weeks Israel and Iran have engaged in direct military exchanges for the first time. It started in February, when the Israelis shot down what they said was an armed Iranian drone entering their territory from Syria. Since then, there have been at least two Israeli air raids on the T-4 airbase in central Syria, home to IRGC troops, ground-to-air missile batteries and drones. The second raid, now officially acknowledged by Israel, killed several Iranians. Tehran has vowed to exact revenge.In anticipation of a retaliatory Iranian strike, Israel cancelled its participation in air force exercises with the US last week and took the unusual step of publishing intelligence satellite photos of five Iranian installations in Syria.In short, the message from Tel Aviv to Tehran was clear: if you come for us, we are ready, and we can hit you hard. Yet by raising the possibility of a big escalation, Israel ran the risk of provoking an even more aggressive response.That was probably deliberate. Last week’s “locked and loaded” Israeli stance was also intended for consumption by the world at large. The obvious implication was that any clash with Iran could quickly suck in existing Syria-based US and Russian forces on opposing sides.Yet such scenarios are not straightforward. When Israel’s back was against the wall in the 1973 Yom Kippur war, it turned to the US for help. Netanyahu would doubtless like to do so again, if necessary. Yet despite vows of eternal friendship and, for example, his ostensibly supportive decision to relocate the US embassy in Jerusalem, Donald Trump has proved an unreliable, unpredictable ally.Since Trump took office last year the US has eschewed serious efforts to revive the Israel-Palestine peace process. One consequence is renewed trouble on the border with Gaza, which flared again last month.Trump’s threat to tear up the west’s nuclear deal with Iran next month, while supported by Netanyahu, has added to the sense of a region spinning into chaos. So, too, did last weekend’s risky and, according to Israeli officials, ineffective cruise missile strikes on Syria by the US, Britain and France.Meanwhile, Trump’s White House continues to insist that, far from pushing back Iran in Syria, the intention is to withdraw American forces as soon as possible, even if the fight against Islamic State – the reason for its presence in Syria – remains unfinished.The linked possibility that Russia, Assad’s most powerful ally, could also be dragged into a wider, military conflict is both paradoxical and alarming. Paradoxical because, by all accounts, Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, believes he has rescued Assad. He would reportedly prefer to cut his losses (and costs) in Syria and, like Trump, bring his forces home.Putin does not want to be drawn into a bigger fight, and certainly not for Iran’s sake. Russia has coordinated with Israel to avoid military clashes until now. But those arrangements are reportedly falling apart under the pressure of events.Russia’s involvement, deliberate or otherwise, in any great confrontation on Syrian soil would inevitably become entangled in Moscow’s other disputes with the US over chemical weapons, the Salisbury poisoning, Ukraine, cyber-attacks and election meddling. The overall mix could prove explosive.Right now, most agree, Israel and Iran are grappling on a cliff edge. A step too far could prove disastrous for one or both. Yet the struggle is about far more than the enmity of these two inveterate foes. A wide range of intractable, neglected and combustible international issues are coming together, all at once, all in one place. The result, 70 years on, could be a new Nakba of truly dreadful proportions.“Iran has the ability to obliterate Israel and, when prompted, to turn Tel Aviv and Haifa into dust.” “It’s seriously not worth it to test the state of Israel.” “We will fight whoever tries to harm us. We will exact a heavy price. The people will stand strong.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3459762.1524066741!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"getting up close and digital with nature s miniature life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBumblebee at broad bean flowers. Illustration: Michael VineyWith a teenager’s devotion to a wild idea, I once turned the family greenhouse into a photographic darkroom. It was the only uncontested space, and its cardboard blackout was proof against all but the brightest chinks of starlight. My first enlarger, conjured from a mysterious, fatherly deal in the pub, was an Edwardian antique of mahogany and brass. It stretched horizontally along the potting bench, the bellows extending on tracks. Its fist-size lens threw a diamond-sharp image, once I had managed to sandwich my modest square of film where the big glass plate of a negative used to go.Making a print was slow, messy and laborious, involving smelly chemicals. As I became more ambitious, the cost of a perfect 10 x 8 print, its darks rich and velvety, could be quite high. But the feeling of accomplishment, of solitary, magical creativity, was incomparable. Moving a digital image from camera to computer screen, all with a click or two, misses out on a whole slice of youthful fulfilment.My first camera, an aged twin-lens Voigtlander, could not focus nearer than a metre. With wooden tripod tied to my crossbar, I cycled off into the countryside for landscapes and quaint corners of stockbroker villages while haunted by Ansel Adams’s wild and wonderful boulders and peaks of Yosemite, borrowed from the town library.Half a century on, in the digital age, I also delight in a different scale of nature – its miniatures – as the rich flow of images from readers arrives at “Eye on Nature”. The capacity of smartphone cameras to get in close, often to a hand’s breadth of the subject, has embraced the beauty and interest of the single flower or woodland mushroom, the single beetle or bumblebee, the inidual butterfly or moth, and (I sometimes shrink to see) the poised and solitary spider. Along with the images comes the quest to know more, which Ethna tries to satisfy.Among Europe’s finest close-up photographers is Dr Robert Thompson, who is based in Banbridge, Co Down. An entomologist, he knows what everything is and where it’s likely to be. I met up with him once in the dunes along the shore and marvelled at the range of Nikon hardware clustered weightily across his chest: if not this camera, then that one, and whichever lens, tripod, knee pads or ancillary gadget needed for the shot.Thompson’s classic work has already been seen in weighty volumes of dragonflies, butterflies and moths published by the Ulster Museum. He has now produced a masterly guide, Close-up and Macro Photography: Its Art and Fieldcraft Techniques. It’s not cheap – €41 even in the hefty, large-format paperback – but it is visually thrilling and technically exhaustive.Thompson’s life as a professional natural history photographer means marketing flawless photos with impact and a personal style: “branding”, as he puts it. Along with the right exposure, white balance, colour temperature and expertise with clinical software comes an artistic gift for an image that draws a gasp.The fieldcraft offered by Thompson, moving from one habitat to another, can be beguilingly practical, as in keeping one’s head off the skyline while stalking dragonflies perched at a pond, or searching for the one mushroom the slugs haven’t got to.Wind and weather count as much as knowing where and when to look, and blue-sky, breezy days are definitely not the best. There are flexible yokes to hold a flower still (among them the wonderful “Wimberley Plamp”), tripods that sprawl obligingly flat on the ground, and screens that diffuse the overly harsh light of bright sun.Early morning finds the light kindest and insects still torpidly waiting to be warmed into life. When they’re flying, a light shower of rain can bring them down to the leaves and add sparkling drops to a flower or a dragonfly’s wing. In winter, soft mist can bejewel a spider’s web or frost coat a seed head or berry in diamonds.Close-up and “macro” photography are not the same: the latter means images often greatly enlarged from life. Not everyone enjoys inspecting the glaze on a wasp’s eyeball. Thompson usually settles for doubling the size, perhaps with telephoto lens and extension tube. If there is a special style to his work, it shows up well in his exquisite studies of day-flying moths pretending to be tree bark and of ineffably elegant caterpillars and dragonflies, or flowers showing off their stamens.His scope widens to lichens, fungi, rock pools and streams (bring your own aquarium and put everything back where you found it). And given his ruthless perfectionism – every hair glistening, every petal immaculate – it is reassuring to be told that smartphone and mobile phone cameras can often yield “acceptable” images.

Voters go to the polls on May 25th to decide whether or not to remove the provision from the Constitution and introduce legislation allowing for abortion in certain circumstances and without restriction in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.Responding to some of the No campaign claims, Mr Varadkar said some assertions during 1995 orce referendum proved to be false.“In 1995 and I remember it well, there was a referendum on orce in this country that was passed by the narrowest of margins. At the time there were placards that read ‘orce aborts marriage’,” he said. The Taoiseach was joined by colleagues in Dublin on Saturday to launch the Fine Gael Vote Yes campaign.“We were told that if we introduced orce in Ireland we would soon have a orce rate like Britain, of thirty or forty per cent. But marriage in Ireland was not destroyed and in the years that followed the numbers of Irish people who got orced did not skyrocket. All we did was give some people a second chance at happiness,” he said. “When there was a referendum on marriage equality the same fears were raised. We were told marriage equality would wreck marriage and redefine it but three years later marriage in Ireland seems to be doing just fine,” he said. Referring to a No campaign assertion on one of its referendum posters, Mr Varadkar added: “If we really believe the Eighth Amendment will result in five times as many women having an abortion - what does that say about us? “ Do we seriously believe there are large number of women in this country who give birth every year and will suddenly decide to have an abortion just because it is legal to do so? If that is the case we think very little of our women and think very little of ourselves,” he added. “We should be a country in which we trust women and trust doctors to decide on what’s right,” said Mr Varadkar. “In Ireland we’ve spent much of the last few years atoning for historic wrongs that were done to women. Truth be told we still wrong women today. The Eighth Amendment does not prevent abortion, nine women travel to countries each day to end their pregnancies,” he said. He said if the referendum is passed “there will not be unrestricted abortion”.He said there will be a waiting period of 72 hours which does not exist in the UK “to allow for reflection” and the woman will receive counselling. “In the Ireland of 2018 we still export our problems and import our solutions and in the Ireland of 2018 we still turn a cold shoulder to our sisters, daughters, nieces and colleagues,” he said. “If the referendum does not pass, nothing can change for Irish women. 3-400 women will continue to travel abroad and the number of women taking abortion bills will rise in their home without medical supervision, It is hard to believe there hasn’t been the tragic death of a woman as result of taking abortion pills,” he said. Minister for Health Simon Harris said the choice being put to voters is not whether they are pro- or anti-abortion as abortion is “unregulated and unsafe” with a lack of medical support.“The choice is do you wish to make the situation in Ireland safe and regulated because it is currently neither,” he said. He asked those on the No side who said there are “better answers” than the Government’s proposals on abortion “to publish those better answers.”Fine Gael referendum co-ordinator, Josepha Madigan said it is 35 years since the introduction of the Eighth Amendment and said “its deep flaws have repeatedly been seen since then”.Ms Madigan said she is a practicing Catholic but that the Eighth Amendment is “medieval in its import and cruel in its practical implication”. She said it has done nothing to stop women availing of abortion services and forces women to go overseas “like cattle.” Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum hereWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the Guardian. “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy.

Dr Mainen, who worked on AI before moving into study of the human brain, argues that the root cause of human depression is an inability to update their beliefs about the world in the presence of new information. He thinks that this ability, in human brains, is modulated by the chemical serotonin. If you don’t have enough serotonin in your brain, you can’t change your understanding of things easily enough.The broad sweep of this is relatively familiar to people interested in how the brain works....To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your  account.

Last year, just 243 cases were reported.Health officials suspect the rise can be attributed to holidaymnakers returning from the continent. In Europe, there has been a large outbreak in measles this year.Dr Yvonne Doyle, London regional director for Public Health England, said: “We are seeing a concerning increase in measles cases across  London which could lead to a wider outbreak in unvaccinated children and adults.Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms“Those who have not received two doses of the vaccine in the past — or who are unsure — should speak to their GP. There’s no harm in receiving an additional dose where there is any uncertainty.“It’s crucial pregnant women have been vaccinated with MMR, as rubella in particular can cause serious complications during pregnancy.”Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms, fever and red, sensitive eyes. It can spread very easily and can be caught by breathing in droplets from an infected person when they cough or sneeze.In rare cases, complications can include deafness, blindness and swelling of the brain, leading to brain damage, and in even more rare cases, a progresssive disorder.Please review our commenting policySunday last chance to enjoy heatwave before temperatures plunge and April showers return Earth Day 2018: The shocking facts about the scale of plastic pollution choking our seas Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsQueen starts the London Marathon as 40,000 runners set offPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsDonald Trump considering pardon for boxing legend Jack Johnson after Sylvester Stallone\u0026#39s callWhat it\u0026#39s like to run the London Marathon - carrying a fridge  World\u0026#39s oldest person dies in Japan at age of 117How the UK\u0026#39s special relationship with the US was replaced by Macron\u0026#39s \u0026#39relation spéciale\u0026#39Lord Ashcroft: Why we should salute the Red Baron, the German flying ace who killed 73 British servicemenEarth Day 2018: Why we all need to join the fight to save Britain\u0026#39s beaches from plastic pollutionNicolas Sarkozy among personalities to condemn \u0026#39ethnic-purging\u0026#39 in wave of \u0026#39new anti-Semitism\u0026#39 in FranceDuchess of Cornwall on the joy of being a grandmother: \u0026#39Spoil them and give them back\u0026#39Facebook given week to protect children as Jeremy Hunt accuses social media firms of \u0026#39turning blind eye\u0026#39Government ided as Brexiteers fear Theresa May is backing plan to tie firms up in Brussels regulationQatar PM went to wedding hosted by \u0026#39one of the world’s most prolific terror financiers\u0026#39Windrush scandal due to pro-European \u0026#39papers, please\u0026#39 attitude, says Jacob Rees-MoggGCHQ warns public ‘absolute protection not possible’ as it briefs power and transport firms on cyber attacks The Queen celebrates her 92nd birthday with a concert at the Royal Albert HallWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"100th anniversary raid zeebrugge pictures","story":"For much of the First World War, the Belgian port of Zeebrugge was used by the Imperial German Navy as a base from which its U-boats were able to attack British maritime targets and light shipping.

In one of the most audacious episodes of the war, the Royal Navy was ordered to take the fight to the enemy in 1918 by attacking Zeebrugge and the canal that led inland to the German submarine base at Bruges. Anthony Upton for The Sunday last chance to enjoy heatwave before temperatures plunge and April showers return Earth Day 2018: The shocking facts about the scale of plastic pollution choking our seas Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsQueen starts the London Marathon as 40,000 runners set offPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsDonald Trump considering pardon for boxing legend Jack Johnson after Sylvester Stallone\u0026#39s callWhat it\u0026#39s like to run the London Marathon - carrying a fridge  World\u0026#39s oldest person dies in Japan at age of 117How the UK\u0026#39s special relationship with the US was replaced by Macron\u0026#39s \u0026#39relation spéciale\u0026#39Lord Ashcroft: Why we should salute the Red Baron, the German flying ace who killed 73 British servicemenEarth Day 2018: Why we all need to join the fight to save Britain\u0026#39s beaches from plastic pollutionNicolas Sarkozy among personalities to condemn \u0026#39ethnic-purging\u0026#39 in wave of \u0026#39new anti-Semitism\u0026#39 in FranceDuchess of Cornwall on the joy of being a grandmother: \u0026#39Spoil them and give them back\u0026#39Facebook given week to protect children as Jeremy Hunt accuses social media firms of \u0026#39turning blind eye\u0026#39Government ided as Brexiteers fear Theresa May is backing plan to tie firms up in Brussels regulationQatar PM went to wedding hosted by \u0026#39one of the world’s most prolific terror financiers\u0026#39Windrush scandal due to pro-European \u0026#39papers, please\u0026#39 attitude, says Jacob Rees-MoggGCHQ warns public ‘absolute protection not possible’ as it briefs power and transport firms on cyber attacks The Queen celebrates her 92nd birthday with a concert at the Royal Albert HallWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2018/04/10/TELEMMGLPICT000158953449_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"eu believes can push britain around northern ireland dont know","story":"Michel Barnier (2nd L) is shown a border road in Co Monaghan between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, in May 2017.This week, the European Union made clear that it was not interested in a mutually beneficial relationship with Britain.

This would be followed by canonisation, when a person officially becomes a saint.The process would be initiated by Robert C. Ndlovu, the Archbishop of Harare, the diocese in which Bradburne died, petitioning the Holy See. Bishop Ndlovu is understood to be supportive of the campaign.A Vatican-appointed \u0026quotpostulator\u0026quot would then investigate Bradburne\u0027s life story in order to gather evidence about his deeds and build the case for his sainthood.The campaign follows the beatification of Cardinal Henry Newman by Pope Benedict XVI in September 2010, during his visit to the United Kingdom.Newman’s canonisation is dependent on the documentation of additional miracles attributed to the cardinal, who died in 1890.In 1970 Pope Paul VI canonised forty English and Welsh Catholic martyrs who were executed between 1535 and 1679.Leading the campaign to beatify Bradburne is his niece Celia Brigstocke, 63, the secretary of the John Bradburne Memorial Society, founded in 1995 to fund the leprosy centre where he worked.She said: \u0026quotPeople relate to John - they like the story, it\u0027s both sad, and also a very rewarding story.\u0026quotI think it\u0027s an inspiration to people.\u0026quotFrank Cottrell Boyce, the novelist and screenwriter who wrote the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony and who is a lifelong Catholic, has donated £400 to support the effort.He told the Sunday  that he was inspired by Bradburne\u0027s story after meeting a former soldier who had served with him during the Second World War, at church in his home parish in Liverpool.\u0026quotHe hasn\u0027t tried to cure his weakness, he\u0027s taken it out there and given it to people. It\u0027s really beautiful,\u0026quot he said. \u0026quotThere\u0027s no big machine behind him - he\u0027s just a secular person, he\u0027s not a member of a religious order, he\u0027s not a priest as such, he\u0027s just a guy trying to live a good life. For logistical reasons those people are underrepresented in the canon as saints.\u0026quotProfessor David Crystal, a linguistics expert who has compiled and published many of Bradburne\u0027s 6,000 poems, has donated £250 to the cause.He said efforts to beatify Bradburne had been held up by the fact that his canonisation would make Zimbabwe\u0027s first saint a white man.\u0026quotIt is a sensitive issue out there. So it took a while for the groundswell of support for Bradburne to convince everybody that even though he was white, who cares - he was looking out for the lepers,\u0026quot he said.A spokesman for the Archbishop of Harare said he was out of office and therefore unable to comment.Vatican City and Holy SeePlease review our commenting policySunday last chance to enjoy heatwave before temperatures plunge and April showers return Earth Day 2018: The shocking facts about the scale of plastic pollution choking our seas Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsQueen starts the London Marathon as 40,000 runners set offPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsDonald Trump considering pardon for boxing legend Jack Johnson after Sylvester Stallone\u0026#39s callWhat it\u0026#39s like to run the London Marathon - carrying a fridge  World\u0026#39s oldest person dies in Japan at age of 117How the UK\u0026#39s special relationship with the US was replaced by Macron\u0026#39s \u0026#39relation spéciale\u0026#39Lord Ashcroft: Why we should salute the Red Baron, the German flying ace who killed 73 British servicemenEarth Day 2018: Why we all need to join the fight to save Britain\u0026#39s beaches from plastic pollutionNicolas Sarkozy among personalities to condemn \u0026#39ethnic-purging\u0026#39 in wave of \u0026#39new anti-Semitism\u0026#39 in FranceDuchess of Cornwall on the joy of being a grandmother: \u0026#39Spoil them and give them back\u0026#39Facebook given week to protect children as Jeremy Hunt accuses social media firms of \u0026#39turning blind eye\u0026#39Government ided as Brexiteers fear Theresa May is backing plan to tie firms up in Brussels regulationQatar PM went to wedding hosted by \u0026#39one of the world’s most prolific terror financiers\u0026#39Windrush scandal due to pro-European \u0026#39papers, please\u0026#39 attitude, says Jacob Rees-MoggGCHQ warns public ‘absolute protection not possible’ as it briefs power and transport firms on cyber attacks The Queen celebrates her 92nd birthday with a concert at the Royal Albert HallWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/21/TELEMMGLPICT000160987283_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq2cL0sTuDPsgaMieaY8Gb6YqX9m0grXVtT35E0WiG8vE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"vatican urged declare british missionary john bradburnea catholic","story":"The Vatican is being urged to declare a British missionary a Catholic saint following reports that he miraculously cured a man of his brain tumor and that blood was inexplicably seen dripping from his coffin.Supporters of John Bradburne are trying to raise £20,000 to fund efforts to beatify the missionary and poet, who died in Zimbabwe in 1979.They say the formal process is about to begin and funds must be raised so a Vatican-appointed investigator can verify details of Bradburne\u0027s life and works, including miracles attributed to him.Bradburne, the son of an Anglican rector who was born in Skirwith, Cumbria, became a Roman Catholic in 1947 after fighting in the Second World WarAfter wandering through Europe and the Middle East he became the warden of a leper colony in Mutemwa, Zimbabwe.But at the age of 58, in the last months of the country’s war of liberation against white minority rule he was killed by guerillas when he refused to leave the colony to save himself.Attendees at his requiem mass reported seeing drops of blood below his coffin, but when it was opened no blood was found inside the casket.Several other miracles have been attributed to Bradburne since his death, including the case of a man in Scotland who supporters claim was cured of a brain tumour after praying to him a decade ago.Over the years annual gatherings in Mutemwa to mark the anniversary of Bradburne’s death have attracted tens of thousands of pilgrims.But to become a saint he would first have to be beatified by the church and this can only take place once the existence of a miracle has been established.

They appear to have an easy rapport with the public, with their shareholders, with the business media, with politicians and with regulators. When things sometimes go wrong, as they inevitably do, they can easily be forgiven. For others, by contrast, an error is widely regarded as another negative, sometimes fatally so.For the first group, they can turn even the very worst into good, not cynically and exploitatively, but naturally. For the latter, it may prove to be the final blow, for the senior management or the brand, or both – the executives destined never to recover their personal reputations.London falls out of top 10 most expensive business travel destinationsWhat’s the most traumatic event to befall an organisation? One that ranks highly or the highest, is a death or deaths or serious injury as a result of something they did not do or due to a design fault they did not correct. For the bosses, a tragedy occurring on their watch is a nightmare. How they respond can determine whether they still have a future or if their careers are over.I’ve now been through several of these product safety occurrences, with different companies, products, markets and countries. Each time, I sit and listen as a tale of disaster unfolds. Often the boss will raise doubts and inject arguments clearly prepared for them by a lawyer. Sometimes, in relation to their subsequent portrayal by the press and on social media, possibly to make them feel better, they will allege the existence of a conspiracy, out to pounce on any mistake.Frequently, their legal adviser will have instructed them to say little, to not do anything that may suggest an acceptance of liability.But there is other advice that is just as crucial. I studied law at university. I know how lawyers think and behave, how they’re taught to avoid saying anything categoric, how they must qualify everything.On my first national newspaper, The Sunday Times, one of the editorial chiefs called me into his office. “You did law, didn’t you?” he said. I nodded. “What’s this,” he asked, pointing to a table.“It’s a table,” I said. “Well, bloody well say so. Don’t say ‘it’s got a flat top and four legs and therefore it could be a table’. It’s a table.”Increasingly, I’m recommending to business leaders, masters of the universe, powerful people who have been hugely successful in their chosen spheres, but are now mired in adversity, a simple truth: be human.

The charge has been made, however incorrectly, that your firm, your product, your name, was somehow involved. Step up, and show them and the world you share their pain. Sorting out the finer points of a lawsuit is for another day. For now, this is about displaying that behind that faceless exterior, a heart beats.It’s the most natural reaction to succumb to the lawyer’s entreaties, and to retreat behind the grand edifice. You can cite all manner of reasons for doing so – that it’s got nothing to do with you, that your involvement is not certain, that it sets an awful precedent for future crises, that you’ve nothing to be ashamed of.All of which may be true. But none of them deal with the reality, an increasing one in today’s world of snap, digital, viral judgment, that businesses must act as if they were human.And not just where there’s been a death or injury. In their treatment of anything that may see them being questioned, their every move dissected and judged, companies must reveal a sure, warm, personal touch. That means not falling back on spin that points to a greater success (“we sell X million units every year and this was the only one to go wrong”), to stellar numbers and profits (similarly of no consequence to those who have suffered, something did go wrong and right now, that is all that matters).None of this is simple, and each case is different. There are always variants, a particular set of circumstances, another twist or detail. Neither should it form part of a textbook creed, a subject to be absorbed at business school.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

She had been staging a sit-in protest with fellow detainees when her unit officer tapped her on the shoulder and said they needed to have a chat. She asked if it could wait until later, but was told it would only take 10 minutes.This was far from the truth. Over the next 12 hours, she and her mother Florence were strapped in waist restraint belts, placed in two separate vans and – chaperoned by a dozen officers – driven to Heathrow to be forcibly removed from Britain– the country Opelo has lived in since the age of 13.“I went down to reception and she sat me in a little room,” the 27-year-old told The Independent. “Then another manager came in and she put on a pair of latex gloves. As soon as she came in with those on I knew what was happening.Woman brought to UK from Botswana as a child in deportation reprieveYarl\u0027s Wood: Inside the crisis-hit immigration detention centreThe attempt to deport Opelo Kgari shows how unjust our system isGovernment thwarted in new bid to deport woman brought to UK as child“I couldn’t believe my unit manager had brought me there under false pretences. Just a few days ago we had sat together and talked about how we could improve the unit, and she was saying she’d do everything she can to make things better. “And then a few days later she’s been really sly and brought me into the situation the way she did. I felt so betrayed and angry.”Opelo was searched and told she could make one phone call before she had to hand over her mobile phone. With fight still in her at this point, she refused, arguing that as she was still in the centre she still had the right to have her possessions. But when she saw her mum brought through the door, she realised she had to make that phone call as soon as possible.“I realised at that point that it’s absolutely pointless trying to argue with these people, and that the sooner I call my solicitor the better. I was only allowed to phone one number, so he was the only person I could call,” she says. “I tried to argue the fact that my case is far bigger than just my solicitor. There are so many other people involved who can help me. But they said my solicitor was the only person who could help me. And that was the last time I could call anyone.”Opelo informed their solicitor as to what was happening. Shortly after the phone call, the “removal team” arrived: a group of 12 officers employed by Tascor, a Capita-owned company contracted by the Home Office to escort detainees to charter flights. Opelo found herself being searched again, this time more stringently.“We had our shoes taken off and we were searched right down to our socks,” she said, her voice breaks. She pauses as she tries to hold back the tears. “I find I can deal with a lot of it as best I can, but when I get searched – especially in the way that they did – it makes me feel so so small, and almost like a criminal, like I’ve done something really wrong. “I broke down when she was searching me. She stripped me of the last bit of dignity that I thought I had.”As this was happening, Opelo saw that their possessions were being loaded into the vans: “Officers had gone into our rooms and started chucking all our clothes and belongings into laundry bags. I recognised my gym bag and realised it was all of our stuff. It’s really hard to deal with and figure out how best to cope with it except just go with it until it’s over.”Government thwarted in new bid to deport woman brought to UK as childAs she was wearing just a pair of leggings and a top, Opelo was told she could change into jeans, but two officers were required to go into the toilet with her. They turned their backs to her, but she wasn’t allowed to close the door.Opelo and her mother were then “bound” in restraint belts, which Tascor has the right to use following an “inidual risk assessment”. Official Home Office guidelines state: “It may be decided that the use of a waist restraint belt provides the most effective method of managing a safe escort”.Despite not trying to physically resist the removal, the women were placed in the “restricted” restraint belt, which meant their wrists were strapped to the waist belt, limiting their arm movement.“They’re made of seatbelt material, but much thicker,” Opelo recalls. “They put it around you and on your wrists, so you can’t really move, you’re literally bound. I couldn’t move my arms more than 30cm from my body. And it has handles on either side on your ribs so that the officers can physically move you if say you didn’t want to walk. So they can pull you along.”At this stage, Opelo breaks down in tears.“I was already stripped of all dignity, so you just kind of go with it. But you just feel… like you’re not even a person anymore. They don’t even treat you like a person, it’s like you don’t matter to anyone. And the whole time my mum was saying that’s my baby, don’t treat her like that.”She and Florence were led into two separate vans, accompanied by six officers in each. As far as Opelo knew, the next time she would see her mum could be on a flight bound for a country she hardly remembers, away from everything she knows.Women in Yarl\u0027s Wood go on hunger strike over \u0027inhumane\u0027 conditionsOpelo – who throughout her time at Yarl’s Wood has tried to maintain a friendly rapport with the officers there, blaming the Home Office for her situation rather than them – is sympathetic towards the staff removing her, explaining that they “tried” to have conversations with her in the van.“They really did try, but I had mentally shut down by this point” she says. “Bless the woman sat next to me. She was so, so lovely. But I just couldn’t find it in myself to try. I think a lot of it stemmed from the way we were treated while we were still in Yarl’s Wood and handed over to them.”The vans arrived to the outskirts of London ahead of schedule, six hours before the flight was due to leave, so the removal team decided to park outside one of Tascor’s offices situated close to Heathrow until the time was more appropriate to go to the airport.“They parked the vans across from each other so they could all come out and talk to each other, but they had to remain in the van,” Opelo remembers. “We were there for a few hours just waiting. I had to stay in the van, separate from my mum.”Throughout the process, Opelo and Florence’s solicitors had been desperately trying to get an injunction from the courts to halt the removal. Three hours before the flight, Florence received a call saying they had succeeded. They would not be removed that day.“It was really good news, but they said that until the Home Office confirms they had to continue with the operation and take them onto security. Even though the judge had made a decision, they still had to wait on the Home Office,” says Opelo.“But it felt like a massive cloud had just shifted, the mood shifted, the officers relaxed a little bit. They said it was such good news they took the belt off me. They were really pleased that we didn’t have to go through with it.”Yarl\u0027s Wood: Inside the crisis-hit immigration detention centreAn hour later, the officers got confirmation of the injunction from the Home Office, and set off back to Yarl’s Wood, the women still in different vans. Due to bad traffic, they didn’t get back until around 10pm, and  then had to wait in reception for two hours.“We had literally left earlier in the day so I thought they should still have everything in place. But we sat and sat and sat. They had a TV so I put Made in Chelsea on – the most mindless show. I watched that and two other shows. Three other people coming in that night. After two and a half hours we got to go to our rooms,” says Opelo.“They had to search everything again. The whole process took another 40 minutes again. So we didn’t get back into our rooms until about 1am. I imagine a lot of money was wasted.”Since The Independent previously spoke to Opelo in February, at which point she had been in Yarl’s Wood for five weeks, there is a notable change in her demeanour. She maintains her ease of communication and is even able to laugh at times, but following the deportation attempt – the second she has been subjected to within a matter of weeks – the optimism and energy she had before has petered away.  “It’s because I don’t have much to smile about. It’s really difficult now to find something to smile about. You have to find joy somewhere, but the situation just gets harder and harder. I sometimes feel like I can’t carry on.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesTeam England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

The widespread public backing for her to remain in Britain is a source of hope, but regardless of her fate, what she has been through is likely to stay with her for years to come.“I’m trying to keep it together. I’ve decided not to see the psychiatrist in the centre because there’s only one and other people in here who need it much more than me, she says. “But I\u0027m pretty certain that when I come out I\u0027ll need to see a well-trained professional to go over the last few months of what I’ve been through. It’s extremely naïve to think it won’t affect me.“Being here is just mental torture, and the Home Office does this so they can tire you out and wear you out. It’s not okay to put people through this. No one should ever have to go through anything in this proximity.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Earlier this month, the court issued an injunction against the removal of Florence and Opelo Kgari although their immigration status remains unchanged. We have noted the injunction and are carefully considering its implications.”They said that they monitor the use of restraint by custody officers closely to ensure that the use of restraint is reasonable, necessary and proportionate, and operate a comprehensive complaints system if detainees feel that they have not been treated in accordance with Home Office standards.Asylum and ImmigrationEmail cannot be used.

Parliament can, if it chooses, let the people have their say on the deal, and with public support for a People’s Vote growing by the day, that’s exactly what parliament should do.”Caroline Lucas, the co-leader of the Green Party and a backer of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain campaign, said that “many MPs from across the political ide” would wish to amend the motion.“It’s now down to parliament to flex its muscles on this issue, and give people a say on this monumentally important decision,” she said.Mr Baker’s admission came in evidence to a Lords committee investigating the nature of the so-called “meaningful vote” on the final deal, which will take place later this year, or early in 2019.The prime minister, and other ministers, have repeatedly insisted that while MPs can reject the agreement reached with the EU, that would simply mean the UK crashing out with no deal at all.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13But Mr Baker, when asked if the motion “would be amendable”, told peers: “I believe the position is that parliament can always seek to amend motions.”The minister was then asked specifically what would happen if an amendment requiring a fresh referendum was carried, replying: “That would be an extremely controversial situation, of course.”Mr Baker acknowledged such an amendment could not be ignored, adding: “We would be in the position where we would have to look extremely carefully at what the amendment precisely was.”And he held open the possibility of attempts to change the nature of the deal – which, if successful, would send the prime minister back to the negotiating table, it has been argued.“Clearly, the range of amendments that is possible is within the bounds of the imagination of all members of parliament,” the minister said.Speaking to the Lords constitution committee on Wednesday, Mr Baker suggested parliament had a duty to respect the referendum result and not to “frustrate that process”.UK wants the EU to protect its products from imitation after BrexitWindrush wasn’t an anomaly – and it has implications for BrexitLiam Fox ‘underestimating’ difficulty of getting farming trade deals“We will leave, there will not be attempts to stay in by the back door, there will not be an attempt to reverse the result,” he insisted – but he admitted it was “a political point, rather than a constitutional point”.Ms May has firmly rejected a further referendum, but some pro-EU Tories believe she could yet accept one if it appears the only way to keep her warring party together on Europe.Similarly, although Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour does not back another referendum, he has left the door open to a change of mind.There is also evidence that support is growing for a referendum on the Brexit deal, amid continuing confusion about both the planned transition period and the final agreement with the EU.A recent poll for Best for Britain found that 44 per cent of people want a vote – a clear eight points ahead of the 36 per cent who reject a further referendum.Opinion appears to be shifting as the negotiations remain bogged down on how to avoid a hard border in Ireland and with the details of a future trade deal unlikely to even be discussed until after departure day.Strikingly, last month David Davis predicted that parliament would vote down the deal unless the trade terms were broadly agreed – but the EU has insisted there is no time before its autumn deadline.The constitution committee was told the vote would take place “as soon as possible” after an expected autumn agreement in Brussels, and that it should be supported “in the national interest”.If parliament backs that motion, it will be followed by a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill (Waib) to put the agreement into legal effect.Some MPs believe the “meaningful vote”, secured in a revolt last December, should take place on the bill, rather than the motion, only then passing the regulations necessary to deliver Brexit.Email cannot be used.

The enquiries are still relevant and should continue.”The conference reacted in shock as it became clear Mr Jones was announcing his resignation.He said: “In any normal political career, you expect to be put through the ringer, and even have your integrity challenged.“I don’t think anyone can know what these last few months have been like. No-one that is, apart from Lisa and the kids.“They have carried me through the darkest of times. I have asked too much of them, and it is time for me to think about what’s fair for them.“And so, this will be the last Welsh Labour conference I address as party leader.“I intend – as I’ve always maintained – to be here to give every answer to every question. But I intend to stand down in the autumn, allowing for a new first minister to take their place by the end of this year.“At that point it will make sense to have a fresh start. For my family, for my party and for my country.”He added: “I am incredibly proud of what we have achieved together so far. The election victories. The landmark legislation. A better deal for nurses, for students and our businesses. Putting Wales on the map.”He will stand down in December.Jack Sargeant at the Welsh Assembly by-election count (PA)At the end of his speech, he received a standing ovation, the BBC reported.Reacting to the announcement, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “I would like to thank Carwyn Jones for his service as leader of Welsh Labour and first minister of Wales.“Carwyn has led Welsh Labour to achieve unprecedented electoral success, forming two Labour Welsh Assembly governments.“Over the last nine years he has stood up to Tory austerity and stood up for the people of Wales as a strong voice for devolution and democracy.”Welsh Secretary Christina Rees said: “Carwyn’s contribution to both Welsh Labour and Welsh public life has been immense. His government has improved the life chances of people across our country, and as his speech today showed, continues to deliver for those people who need us most.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesTeam England Athletes during the Commonwealth Games Team England Parade in Victoria Square, Birmingham.Varun Chopra of Essex during the Specsavers County Championship Division One match between Essex and Lancashire at the Chelmsford County Cricket Ground.

But the feisty feline navigated the long journey back to his original home in Raleigh, North Carolina, so that he could be with them again.Rather than welcoming him back, his original family took him to a local animal shelter and asked if he could be euthanised.The \u0027happiest cats in the world\u0027 might just be in MoroccoHowever, instead of putting him down, the shelter made a call to animal protection charity, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), who took him into their shelter to be rehomed.When Toby first arrived at their shelter he was “laid back and “people-friendly”, but not too keen on other cats, the charity\u0027s communications manager Tara Lyn told The Independent.He has now found a home with mum, Michele, and her children, the charity said separately earlier this week.  He also has two other cats around the house to keep him company and his family says they are “getting along well”.Ms Lyn described Toby’s story as “heart-breaking”, adding that they did not know all the details about what the family asked for him to be put down but he got a second chance.Toby was rejected by the family he walked 12 miles to be with (Jenny Winston Photography)Toby the cat settles into his temporary home at the SPCA shelter in Raleigh (SPCA)Toby is infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which means that his immune system is weakened, but this should not prevent him from living a long, otherwise healthy life as long as he has people around him who look out for signs of secondary symptoms, and take him for regular appointments with a vet.Toby with his new mum Michele (SPCA)“If people are moved by Toby’s story, we ask that they take action rather than just commenting on the story online,” Ms Lyn said. “Toby wouldn’t have the happy ending that he has now if we didn’t have volunteers, staff and the funding to do the work we do. We hope his story inspires people to make a donation, consider adopting from a shelter or becoming a volunteer.

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.Inside Story - How to address Dalits plight?There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSouth Koreans cheer during the welcoming event for the inter-Korean summit between South Korea and North Korea in Seoul.

Some consumers wondered whether the French meat industry was feeling threatened by the rise in popularity of vegan food others doubted that consumers would ever be confused.One said: This is ridiculous.
