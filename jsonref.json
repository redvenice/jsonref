This was nothing more than a failure to remove a diagnostic function after development.\u0027The issues were identified by independent security testing, initiated by Vodafone as part of our routine security measures, and fixed at the time by Huawei.\u0027The Chinese firm is at the centre of a debate about the company\u0027s trustworthiness and whether it should be used at the centre of communications network infrastructure.It was reportedly given the green light by Prime Minister Theresa May to be used in non-essential parts of the UK\u0027s upcoming 5G network.         In the US, the use of certain Huawei equipment is already banned on security grounds and the UK is now being pressured to take a similar approach       Earlier this year founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei (pictured with China´s President Xi Jinping), said the company had never been asked to share \u0027improper information\u0027 Huawei has been the subject of concern for some years because of allegations of close ties to the country\u0027s government.Under Chinese law, firms are compelled to \u0027support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work\u0027.A deputy assistant secretary at the US State Department, Robert Strayer, said on Monday that Huawei \u0027was not a trusted vendor\u0027 and any use of its technology in 5G networks was a risk.And his position was backed by a Conservative member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, Bob Seely, who said: \u0027Huawei cannot, by definition, be a trusted vendor. It is required by law to co-operate with Chinese secret services. It is close to, if not part of, the Chinese state.\u0027China has achieved great things, and we need to respect it and develop good deep relations with it, but it also has a reputation for wholesale intellectual property theft and state hacking.         Responding to the Vodafone report, Huawei said it was made aware of historical vulnerabilities in 2011 and 2012 and they were addressed at the time         The company has denied having ties with the government and claims that it abides by the law\u0027Its military theory sees warfare as a battle between systems, including communications systems. It takes a very different approach to human rights and human freedoms.\u0027It goes without saying that to allow Huawei into our network is a risk – the question is how much.\u0027Some critics have expressed concerns that Beijing could require the firm to install technological \u0027backdoors\u0027 to enable it to spy on or disable Britain\u0027s communications network.Huawei has always denied having ties to the state and says it abides by the laws of the countries in which it operates.Founder Ren Zhengfei said earlier this year that Huawei had never been asked to share \u0027improper information\u0027 about its partners by the government.He said: \u0027I personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests. \u0027No law in China requires any company to install mandatory back doors.\u0027The US has already banned the use of some Huawei equipment on security grounds and is pressuring its allies – including the UK – to take a similar approach, warning the firm poses an \u0027unacceptable risk\u0027.In a statement on the Vodafone report, Huawei said: \u0027We were made aware of historical vulnerabilities in 2011 and 2012 and they were addressed at the time.\u0027Software vulnerabilities are an industry-wide challenge.

New research from the Anna Freud Centre shows excluded children are more likely to experience behavioural and attention difficulties, emotional problems, difficulties with peers and perceived stress.Stephen Taylor, the school’s founding head teacher, said: ‘Having parents there is key to making a change. It means that, when the child gets back into mainstream, this is a parent who is supportive of the school because they’ve realised some of the difficulties – rather than being a parent who maybe assumes that a school is picking on their child or has got it wrong.’         Kate is involved as part of her ongoing work with mental health charities. Pictured as she attends the 2017 Gala Dinner for The Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families        Working parents can share the burden, come in for half days or send grandparents in their place. Parents have to attend a one-day learning programme every week to coach them in skills to deal with challenging behaviour. Part of the journey is bringing parents out of the ‘denial’ that their child has a problem, Mr Taylor said. ‘It’s challenging for the parents because they have to acknowledge there’s things that they could do differently,’ he said.However, he said the classes are ‘non-judgmental’, adding: ‘Even those parents with the most challenging young people in the most challenging situations, they want something better.’Mr Taylor said the centre focusses on conveying a ‘message of hope’ to families and helping them to become ‘engaged’ with their child’s schooling.Much of pupils’ time is spent learning the National Curriculum. However, they also attend therapy sessions with experts accompanied by their parents.Last year, the Duchess announced a new project to help mend ‘broken Britain’ through supporting families in difficulty.She has made early-years intervention one of the cornerstones of her public work after seeing how so many problems faced by adults she had met – mental health issues, addiction and social exclusion – stem from their childhood.The Duchess has set up a task force of experts to investigate the issue, with a view to announcing a series of findings and recommendations later this year."},{"url":null,"title":"Education bosses call universities reduce entry grade requirements poor students","story":"Share this article Already, many universities let in disadvantaged students with one or two grades less, but the OfS said many institutions are not lowering requirements enough.New research shows youngsters from rich neighbourhoods are six times more likely to get into a top university than those from poor areas. The OfS said part of the reason is that those in deprived areas have had more disadvantages, and this should be recognised when their potential is being assessed.Today\u0027s OfS report comes as it holds its conference. Chairman Sir Michael Barber will say: \u0027\u0027A young person from a council estate who gets decent A levels has often had to work a lot harder than the young person from a better off neighbourhood who gets a few grades more.\u0027That\u0027s why it is right that contextual admissions are now an increasing part of the picture.\u0027We are wasting talent, denying opportunity and hurting our economy by not making the most of our greatest asset: our people.\u0027Education secretary Damian Hinds said: \u0027A university education should be available to everyone who has the talent to benefit from it and we have made great progress in ensuring universities are open to all, with record rates of disadvantaged 18-year-olds in higher education.\u0027But there is more to do and we know that contextual offers can play an important part in levelling the playing field so those from disadvantaged backgrounds can flourish in higher education.\u0027I want institutions to consider a broad range of information in their offers, including the context in which a student\u0027s results were achieved.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Ice cream vans facing extinction UK councils ban polluting vehicles","story":"Share this articleIce cream vans banned from London streets in crackdown on pollution | London Evening Standard"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/04/29/22/12877156-0-image-m-15_1556572021333.jpg","title":"Facebook Secret Crush embarrassing version Tinder Twitter users say F8 Conference","story":"Share this article                            Many expressed how they merge of dating and online friendships was unwanted         The idea of Facebook Dating\u0027s Secret Crush feature was downright creepy for some people Only those 18 and over can use Facebook Dating.It was only available in Colombia, Thailand, Canada, Argentina, and Mexico but on Tuesday expanded to 14 new countries: Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Laos, Brazil, Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Uruguay, Guyana, and Suriname.There\u0027s no telling how users sharing their romantic feelings with the tech giant could affect their crush\u0027s news feed, adverts and other parts of the site, potentially indicating they\u0027re on someone\u0027s crush list without an outright confirmation.However Facebook said data obtained from the dating feature will not be shared externally.

concerned by the political vacuum left by the still incomplete resolution to the decades-long Troubles.John de Chastelain, one of the international peace brokers whose work led to the 1998 Belfast Agreement, says that it was never a “hard and fast political solution” to all the problems facing Northern Ireland, but rather a “blueprint” showing what should happen with a lot more work required to make it happen.“My great regret is that more than 20 years after the agreement was brought into effect there are still those who are seeking to use violence to change what is achieved, particularly when a whole new generation of people who weren’t alive during the Troubles are now voting.“What can they vote for if the Assembly is not in office, and it has been two years now that the Assembly has not been providing the government and the leadership in the North that the agreement was all about?”Sitting in a Dublin hotel ahead of a visit later this week to Dundalk Institute of Technology where a library is being named in his honour, the soft-spoken retired soldier still monitors Irish affairs closely despite relinquishing his role as chairman of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning in 2011.The recent killing of journalist Lyra McKee in Derry prompted feelings of sadness and regret for the 81-year-old former diplomat.“It was a tragedy that a very able young woman lost her life like that,” said de Chastelain of the killing of the 29-year-old by dissident republicans during rioting after police searches in the Creggan estate.He acknowledges that not all elements of militant republicanism – notably the Real IRA – bought into the 1998 peace agreement and paramilitary groups operated in “a very distributive system”, so it was impossible to guarantee that “all” the North’s guns were decommissioned.“The continuation of violence hasn’t altogether surprised me, but I would have thought that this long after the agreement – 21 years – that those issues would have subsided.”No public supportDe Chastelain is as puzzled as many others at the remarks made by the “New IRA” – the dissident republican group that has admitted killing McKee – that her death did not further its “cause”.“The spokesman for the group that were responsible for the death of this young woman made the point that they recognised they had no public support and that violence will never change the circumstance of the political ide, so I have to ask myself: what is the point of continuing?”The Canadian clings to the one positive development that might emerge from McKee’s killing: that the two main political parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, will restart talks that might lead to the restoration of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing executive which was dissolved in January 2017.De Chastelain sees the UK’s departure from the European Union and not knowing exactly how Brexit will affect Ireland and Britain afterwards as “troubling” for Northern Ireland. Any hardening of the Border because of Brexit “would be a tremendous shame”, he says.“One of the key aspects of the Belfast Agreement was in fact that the Border was open, and for those who chafed at the prospect of there being two jurisdictions – one on either side of the Border – that was much less of a problem since the Border was opened. I would hope that it would stay that way.”He declines to say whether he thinks Brexit should happen or not, but admits to having a personal interest in the debate given his long-time role in the peace process. He shares the general frustration of those struggling to figure out how the UK parliament will proceed, and what it means for the Border.“Everybody is on edge because they don’t know how this is going to work out. Once the decision is taken, whenever that will be, then I think, hopefully, wiser heads will prevail, and it won’t affect the two-way movement between the Republic and the North.”StudentsDe Chastelain is upbeat about the potential for the Border and “a burgeoning place” like the Dundalk Institute of Technology because it draws students from both sides of the Border.His involvement with Dundalk comes from his connection with the Ireland Park Foundation, a Toronto-based arts, culture and heritage charitable foundation, and its chairman, the Irish-Canadian businessman Robert Kearns. The two men shared interest in the 19th century politician and journalist Thomas D’Arcy McGee, one of the fathers of the Canadian Confederation who was born in nearby Carlingford, Co Louth.De Chastelain puts his work in Northern Ireland “right at the top” of a storied career that included leading Canada’s armed forces and serving as his country’s ambassador to the United States.Monitoring decommissioning was one of his toughest roles. “The public wished to see the instruments of their pain being dismantled in a such a way that they could say, ‘well. now we know it is all done’,” says de Chastelain, but there was “no way” the paramilitaries were going to allow it be seen as an act of surrender.He smiles recalling how his initial assignment in Northern Ireland in 1995 was intended to last two months before he was sucked into the decommissioning body. “It wasn’t until 15 years later that I went home.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3876700.1556656254!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in believes it needs a win on the irish language issue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and DUP leader Arlene Foster:  One of the reasons Sinn Féin  wants ‘a win’ on the Irish language issue  is because it’s so hard for the DUP to swallow.  Photograph:  Brian Lawless PA Wire Every time Sinn Féin says it will approach the forthcoming Northern talks with “positivity” or “hope”, its leaders soon add a qualification – there has to be a plan if they don’t work.It’s easy to see that the party isn’t very optimistic that the talks will reach agreement on the relaunching of the institutions. Of course, the only route that the party sees for a successful conclusion of the talks is one that delivers its requirements – an Irish language Act, the legalisation of same-sex marriage and the extension of abortion rights to the North – the trinity of demands that the party now refers to as the “equality agenda”.If the DUP won’t agree – and it won’t, as Sinn Féin knows, at least not immediately – then Sinn Féin wants the two governments to step in. Or, more accurately, it wants the British government to step in and legislate for its “equality agenda” at Westminster, over the heads of the DUP.In fairness to it, the party acknowledges the two obvious things about that request: firstly, it faces the obstacle of the DUP’s confidence and supply agreement with the Conservatives and, secondly, looking to the British to govern Northern Ireland because its parties can’t isn’t very self-determination-y, is it?When pressed, senior party sources acknowledge that the Irish language Act is of a separate order to the same-sex marriage and abortion issues, which have really been adopted by the party only relatively recently.Sinn Féin’s current position on abortion, after all, is less than a year old. And for all the prominence given to the two social issues now, you could easily forget that they had nothing to do with the collapse of the institutions in 2017.Litmus testThe Irish language issue, though, is more important and is regarded by the party and much of its base as a litmus test for any new administration. The party wants, and feels it needs, “a win” on the issue, not just because it would be a signal to many of its supporters about parity of respect for Irishness in the North, but because it’s so hard for the DUP to swallow. In the North’s bitterly polarised politics, a win for you is a loss for me, and vice versa.Senior party figures have also signalled that they will not accept any agreement to reconstitute the assembly and the powersharing administration that runs the risk of collapsing again after a few months. This rather pointedly ignores the fact that it was Sinn Féin which brought down the powersharing institutions two years ago over the botched renewable heat incentive (RHI) scheme (and that the DUP has a standing offer to relaunch them without pre-conditions) but it does underline the low expectations that the party has about these talks.There is a lingering suspicion around some quarters that the Taoiseach’s office and Number 10 Downing Street announced the talks without a clear plan for what would happen next. In fact, there has been extensive work done by officials behind the scenes preparing for these talks. That is no guarantee they will reach any satisfactory conclusion, though. Judging by the mood music, the chances for success hardly look overwhelming right now.Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3876732.1556658985!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar urges concessions from dup and sinn f%C3%A9in","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan and Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald:  The party believes the British government should legislate at Westminster for abortion, same-sex marriage and an Irish language act for the North if the DUP refuses to agree. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has appealed to the Northern parties to compromise in order to revive the Stormont institutions, while Sinn Féin has warned that the Irish and British governments must have a “plan B” to legislate for the Irish language, same-sex marriage and abortion rights at Westminster in case the talks fail.Mr Varadkar urged Sinn Féin and the DUP to be “generous” and make concessions in the Northern talks to achieve a breakthrough that would enable the powersharing institutions be reconstituted, rather than focusing on what happens if they are not successful.“We’d like people to focus on making them a success and that really requires all the parties, but particularly the two largest parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, making progress and being generous and even making a few concessions that would allow us to get the powersharing institutions up and running,” Mr Varadkar said.The Taoiseach was speaking after Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the two governments needed to have a “plan B” for what happens if the talks fail.‘Positivity’“We will go into these talks with hope and positivity,” Ms McDonald said. “We will also go in with our eyes wide open, because we have been to his place before. Whatever happens, we’re very clear that the current political stalemate cannot continue. It’s simply unacceptable at this stage.“So in the event that we cannot resolve the equality issues, that the DUP cannot join with us to hard-wire equality into the system of governance . . . in those circumstances then the two governments will have to intervene.”The party believes the British government should legislate at Westminster for abortion, same-sex marriage and an Irish language act for the North if the DUP refuses to agree.Talks aimed at restoring devolution are set to begin next Tuesday following Thursday’s local election vote in the North. Stormont collapsed in January 2017 when the late Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister.British prime minister Theresa May has told her cabinet the London and Dublin governments are engaged in “intensive preparations” with the Northern Ireland parties ahead of the start of a fresh round of talks next week.After the British cabinet meeting, Mrs May’s spokesman said: “The PM said that while momentum exists around the need to commence the talks process, we should not underestimate the challenges facing the Northern Ireland parties.“Intensive preparations are now taking place between the UK and Irish governments and with the Northern Ireland parties on the structure and substance of the talks.”However, Sinn Féin sources said they had not been given any details about the timing, schedule or agenda for the talks yet.Meanwhile, the former head of the body responsible for decommissioning paramilitary weapons in Northern Ireland is concerned by the political vacuum left by the still-incomplete resolution to the decades-long Troubles.John de Chastelain, one of the international peace brokers whose work led to the 1998 Belfast Agreement, says that it was never a “hard and fast political solution” to all the problems facing Northern Ireland, but rather a “blueprint” showing what should happen, with a lot more work required to make it happen.“My great regret is that more than 20 years after the agreement was brought into effect, there are still those who are seeking to use violence to change what is achieved, particularly when a whole new generation of people who weren’t alive during the Troubles are now voting.”Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3876624.1556651284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour reaffirms policy that identifies second referendum as an option","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Jeremy Corbyn: the SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has accused the Labour leader of conspiring with “a Tory-led Brexit shambles”. Photograph:  Stefan RousseauReutersJeremy Corbyn has fought off an attempt to change Labour’s policy on Brexit by committing the party to a second referendum in all circumstances. The ruling national executive committee (NEC) agreed after a five-hour meeting on Tuesday to retain the current policy that identifies a second referendum as “an option” if Labour cannot force changes to Theresa May’s deal or trigger a general election.“Labour’s European elections manifesto was agreed at the NEC today and it will be published soon,” a party spokesman said. “The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour’s existing policy to support Labour’s alternative plan, and if we can’t get the necessary changes to the government’s deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote.”Pro-Europeans led by deputy leader Tom Watson wanted the manifesto to commit Labour to putting any Brexit deal approved by MPs to a confirmatory referendum. After the meeting,some pro-European MPs claimed that the decision meant that a vote for Labour could still open the way for a second referendum.However, Gloria De Piero, a Midlands MP who insists that the outcome of the 2016 referendum must be respected, also welcomed the decision.“Labour’s manifesto for the European parliament will not contain a pledge to hold a second Brexit referendum.The party’s ruling national executive committee agreed that another nationwide poll should only be “an option” if it cannot force a general election.” The Scottish National Party (SNP), Change UK and the Liberal Democrats said the NEC’s decision showed that Labour was not committed to a second referendum. The SNP’s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, accused the Labour leader of conspiring with “a Tory-led Brexit shambles”.“Jeremy Corbyn today had an opportunity to help bring an EU referendum closer, but instead he has chosen to continue his complicity in the Tories’ plan to remove us from the EU.” Indicative votesMrs May wants talks with Labour over a common approach to Brexit to conclude by the middle of next week. If the two sides fail to agree a common approach, the government will schedule a series of indicative votes on options for Brexit, probably including a customs union and a second referendum.Two former Conservative ministers, Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan, said on Tuesday that they would chair a new initiative to develop “alternative arrangements” for the Border to avoid the Northern Ireland backstop.\u0026nbspThe Alternative Arrangements Commission will seek to develop detailed proposals to avoid physical infrastructure at the Border with\u0026nbsp“comprehensive customs co-operation arrangements, facilitative arrangements and technologies” as set out in a document agreed between Britain and the EU in Strasbourg in March.The commission said it had engaged a technical panel of border and customs experts, practitioners and lawyers with detailed knowledge of trade, business and community relationships in Ireland, as well as EU, UK and international trade regulations.“Nine working groups have been created covering topics including the Border and the movement of people in the context of the Good Friday agreement, tax, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, small traders and trusted trader schemes,” the commission said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their

recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very

and therefore better for everyone.Transport Minister Jesse Norman said last week that local roads were not in great shape as they have historically been a poor relation in terms of transport funding.It emerged in March that more than 40,000 miles of Britain’s roads are at risk of crumbling within the next five years.Councils were given an extra £420m last year to tackle the growing number of potholes, alongside a £28.8bn Government fund to upgrade England’s motorways.A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: Councils are fixing a pothole every 17 seconds, but funding challenges remain for local authorities to deal with long term maintenance of their local roads and pavements.This is why we have called on the Government to also invest the equivalent of 2p of existing fuel duty to bring our roads up to scratch.“Long term funding will help to avoid more costly short term repairs.New technology to stop potholes from forming in the first place is among a range of preventative measures under consideration by the Government.A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: “The Government recognises the importance of ensuring the local environment is convenient, safe and attractive to walk in, including keeping pavements in good order.“We have provided local authorities with more than £6.6 billion for roads maintenance and pothole repair in the six years to 2021, as well as around £2 billion to encourage cycling and walking.”Department for TransportPlease review our commenting policyVenezuela latest: Juan Guaido calls for final phase of #OperationLiberty after violent clashes in bid to oust MaduroTraining parents to be stricter could reverse obesity epidemic among children, Oxford University study findsTheresa May is most evasive Tory leader in past 50 years, scientific study finds Crimes are going unsolved because forensic science services are in crisis, a damning Lords report warnsSmart devices to carry warning labels telling buyers how easy they are to hack, government saysOxbridge should consider poor pupils with one B and two Cs at A-Level for a place, universities regulator saysCriminal record checks on employees at risk of delays as IT scheme hits troubleFirefighters tackle blaze at hotel and spa in west LondonTheresa May preparing to cave in to Labour demands on Brexit, Eurosceptics fearComment: The Tories must wake up to the existential calamity about to engulf themAvengers fans bursting to see Endgame will get toilet break during three hour superhero finaleJeremy Corbyn in fresh anti-Semitism row after endorsing book about Jews controlling banks and the pressTainted blood warning as GPs told thousands of victims may still be unaware they were infectedBake Off: The Professionals, episode 1 review: beetroot gel and umeboshi caramel – this Bake Off is far more serious White House planning to designate Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisationGovernment accused of profiting from victims\u0026#39 reporting crime by collecting VAT on 101 callsComment: Cambridge\u0026#39s virtue-signalling slavery probe should be greeted with heavy intellectual scepticismCambridge University inquiry into slave trade connections is \u0026#39virtue signalling on steroids\u0026#39, Trevor Phillips saysPeople should not be forced to sell their home to fund social care, suggests Matt HancockBritons will have to do more to cut down on climate change, Michael Gove tells activists to help meet targetsWimbledon to reduce plastic use with players\u0026#39 restrung rackets no longer returned in bagsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new japanese emperor empress could save chrysanthemum throne","story":"A new era has dawned for Japan, one that many hope will bring modernity to the Chrysanthemum throne.Emperor Akihito has abdicated, the first Japanese emperor to do so in over 200 years.

such as whether they qualify for free school meals - should be considered by all universities when assessing a candidate.League table providers are facing pressure to tweak their criteria so universities which make a greater number of contextual admissions are not penalised.Several top institutions last year expressed concern that any change to their admissions practice would cause “reputational damage” as they plunged down the rankings.But the OfS said there remains “no clearly understood approach” to contextual admissions across the sector, with guidance on grades which varies widely.Sir Michael Barber, chairman of the OfS, said: “A young person from a council estate who gets decent A levels has often had to work a lot harder than the young person from a better off neighbourhood who gets a few grades more.“That’s why it is right that contextual admissions are now an increasing part of the picture.“When I visit great American universities, I’m struck by how they look beyond standardised test scores to see potential civic leaders, potential public servants, potential entrepreneurs who can succeed if given the chance to shine.“When it comes to trying to reach beyond their traditional intakes, these universities have got something to teach us.”The regulator also identified the need for “more erse routes” into higher education, such as bridging course, foundation years and degree apprenticeships.Foundation years can be offered to students who miss their A-Level requirements or lack qualifications as a precursor to their degree course, while apprenticeships integrate study and work.The OfS hopes to eliminate the gulf between the most and least disadvantaged students at the country’s top universities within the next 20 years.Venezuela latest: Juan Guaido calls for final phase of #OperationLiberty after violent clashes in bid to oust MaduroTraining parents to be stricter could reverse obesity epidemic among children, Oxford University study findsTheresa May is most evasive Tory leader in past 50 years, scientific study finds Crimes are going unsolved because forensic science services are in crisis, a damning Lords report warnsElderly prevented from walking on pavements due to potholes, survey findsSmart devices to carry warning labels telling buyers how easy they are to hack, government saysCriminal record checks on employees at risk of delays as IT scheme hits troubleFirefighters tackle blaze at hotel and spa in west LondonTheresa May preparing to cave in to Labour demands on Brexit, Eurosceptics fearComment: The Tories must wake up to the existential calamity about to engulf themAvengers fans bursting to see Endgame will get toilet break during three hour superhero finaleJeremy Corbyn in fresh anti-Semitism row after endorsing book about Jews controlling banks and the pressTainted blood warning as GPs told thousands of victims may still be unaware they were infectedBake Off: The Professionals, episode 1 review: beetroot gel and umeboshi caramel – this Bake Off is far more serious White House planning to designate Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisationGovernment accused of profiting from victims\u0026#39 reporting crime by collecting VAT on 101 callsComment: Cambridge\u0026#39s virtue-signalling slavery probe should be greeted with heavy intellectual scepticismCambridge University inquiry into slave trade connections is \u0026#39virtue signalling on steroids\u0026#39, Trevor Phillips saysPeople should not be forced to sell their home to fund social care, suggests Matt HancockBritons will have to do more to cut down on climate change, Michael Gove tells activists to help meet targetsWimbledon to reduce plastic use with players\u0026#39 restrung rackets no longer returned in bagsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 30 april 2019","story":"Tower Bridge is lifted for luxury cruise ship \u0027Le Champlain\u0027, operated by Ponant, to cross underneath on its outward journey to the sea.

He called on supporters to take to the streets again on Wednesday.Tomorrow we continue with the execution of #OperationLiberty, he wrote.  We begin the final phase and we will be in a sustained way in the streets until we achieve the cessation of the usurpation. Let\u0027s go with everything, with more strength and determination!A few thousand protesters were pelted with tear gas in Caracas on Tuesday and at one point an armoured vehicle rammed into the crowds, appearing to leave some people injured. Dozens of people were reportedly injured in clashes as the violence spread across the country throughout the day.Earlier in the day Mr Guaido, who has declared himself interim president, released a video of himself alongside around a dozen soldiers who he claimed had defected. He praised the “braze soldiers” and urged more to do likewise, saying the “final push” toward removing embattled socialist president Nicolas Maduro was underway. Soldiers ride on top of a car with supporters of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido during anti-goverment protests, in CaracasLeopoldo Lopez, a fellow opposition politician, also appeared in the video despite being under house arrest since 2017. He claimed forces loyal to Mr Guaido had released him.Mr Maduro’s government labelled the move an attempted “coup”, a description echoed by supportive politicians abroad, and vowed to crack down on the “military traitors”.Mr Maduro later said military leaders had assured him they remained loyal. There were few public signs that Mr Guaido’s call had triggered a broader revolt among commanders. US Secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed that Mr Maduro had been set to fly out of Venezuela on Tuesday morning but was talked out of it by the Russians.Mr Trump publicly accused Cuba of conducting military options in Venezuela to support Mr Maduro and threatened a “complete embargo” and “highest-level sanctions” unless they stopped. Bruno Rodríguez, Cuba\u0027s Minister of Foreign Affairs denied there the presence of any Cuban military in the country, writing on Twitter: There are no Cuban troops in #Venezuela nor are there any Cubans taking part in military or security operations there.Senior US administration figures gave their vocal backing to Mr Guaido, with vice president Mike Pence, Mr Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton all issuing supportive statements.Mr Trump tweeted: “I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the people of Venezuela and their freedom! Mr Bolton said that America was “very well informed” with what was taking place and again declined to rule out military action, insisting “all options” were on the table.But Antonio Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, urged “maximum restraint” on all sides, while the body’s spokesman said the dispute must be resolved “peacefully”. Sir Alan Duncan, the UK government minister for the Americas, said he was watching events “very closely”, adding that Mr Guaido had shown “courage, creativity and resolution”. Mr Guaido and his supporters gathered near the Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, the military airport in Caracas where his video appeared to have been shot. President of the Venezuelan Parliament Juan GuaidoAround 70 soldiers wearing blue armbands in support for Mr Guaido reportedly squared off against security forces loyal to the regime.One pro-Guaido solider was injured in the clashes.  As more supporters joined, the scenes turned increasingly ugly. Footage showed water cannons being used on the crowds and, at one moment, a military vehicle smashing into protesters. On Tuesday night at least 25 Venezuelan troops sought asylum in Brazil\u0027s embassy in Caracas, a senior Brazilian official said.A spokesman for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said soldiers and lieutenants were among the applicants.The petitions for asylum came as Bolsonaro threw his support behind Venezuelans enslaved by a dictator, a reference to President Nicolas Maduro whom Guaido is challenging for power.Brazil is on the side of the people of Venezuela, President Juan Guaido and the freedom of Venezuelans, Bolsonaro said in a series of tweets.We support the freedom of this sister nation to finally live a true democracy.Opposition demonstrators face military vehicles near the Generalisimo Francisco de Miranda Airbase \u0026#34La Carlota\u0026#34 in CaracasTuesday\u0027s call for a military uprising was the boldest attempt yet by Mr Guaido, who cited constitutional powers back in January to declare himself interim president, to force Mr Maduro from power.His claim has been supported by America and more than 50 other countries, some of whom have implemented sanctions. But others, including Russia, are backing Mr Maduro. In the video, Mr Guaido, 35, spoke directly to camera as more than a dozen soldiers dressed in military uniform, some holding guns, stood to attention behind him.“Today, brave soldiers, brave patriots, brave men loyal to the Constitution have followed our call,” said Mr Guaido, who is also president of the country’s National Assembly. He called on people to take to the streets all over Venezuela and claimed that “the definitive end of the usurpation starts today”.He added: “Today as the caretaker president of Venezuela, as the legitimate commander-in-chief of the armed forces, I call on all soldiers, the military family, to accompany us in this mission.”  Mr Lopez, seen as Mr Guaido’s political mentor, stood behind.He later said: “I want to tell the Venezuelan people: This is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers.” There were reports the action was taken earlier than planned because Mr Guaido feared imminent arrest.  Soon after the video, which appeared to have been filmed in the early morning, was posted online the move was condemned by Mr Maduro’s ministers. Vladimir Padrino, the Venezuelan defence minister, said: We reject this coup movement, which aims to fill the country with violence.”He insisted the country’s forces remained loyal to Mr Maduro.  Jorge Rodriguez, the country’s information minister, wrote on Twitter that the “military traitors who were seeking to promote a “coup” were being confronted. A Kremlin spokesman and the Bolivan president Evo Morales, key allies of Mr Maduro, called the uprising a “coup” attempt. Cuba’s foreign minister also denounced the move. But Donald Trump’s administration issued statements of support. Mr Pence tweeted to Mr Guaido and his supporters: “We are with you! America will stand with you until freedom and democracy are restored.”  Sprain, instrumental in shaping the European Union’s stance on Venezuela, was more cautious, with a government spokesman calling for a “peaceful democratic process” rather than “bloodshed”. It was unclear whether Mr Guaido’s message had resonated with the military leaders whose support is critical in keeping Mr Maduro in power despite a crumbling economy and electricity blackouts. A soldier in the group with Mr Guaido denied government claims they had been tricked into acting, telling Reuters: “We\u0027re all afraid, but we had to do it.” Another protest called for by Mr Guaido and his supporters is due to take place today. Please review our commenting policyTraining parents to be stricter could reverse obesity epidemic among children, Oxford University study findsTheresa May is most evasive Tory leader in past 50 years, scientific study finds Crimes are going unsolved because forensic science services are in crisis, a damning Lords report warnsElderly prevented from walking on pavements due to potholes, survey findsSmart devices to carry warning labels telling buyers how easy they are to hack, government saysOxbridge should consider poor pupils with one B and two Cs at A-Level for a place, universities regulator saysCriminal record checks on employees at risk of delays as IT scheme hits troubleFirefighters tackle blaze at hotel and spa in west LondonTheresa May preparing to cave in to Labour demands on Brexit, Eurosceptics fearComment: The Tories must wake up to the existential calamity about to engulf themAvengers fans bursting to see Endgame will get toilet break during three hour superhero finaleJeremy Corbyn in fresh anti-Semitism row after endorsing book about Jews controlling banks and the pressTainted blood warning as GPs told thousands of victims may still be unaware they were infectedBake Off: The Professionals, episode 1 review: beetroot gel and umeboshi caramel – this Bake Off is far more serious White House planning to designate Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisationGovernment accused of profiting from victims\u0026#39 reporting crime by collecting VAT on 101 callsComment: Cambridge\u0026#39s virtue-signalling slavery probe should be greeted with heavy intellectual scepticismCambridge University inquiry into slave trade connections is \u0026#39virtue signalling on steroids\u0026#39, Trevor Phillips saysPeople should not be forced to sell their home to fund social care, suggests Matt HancockBritons will have to do more to cut down on climate change, Michael Gove tells activists to help meet targetsWimbledon to reduce plastic use with players\u0026#39 restrung rackets no longer returned in bagsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/31/16/toysrus.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6165001  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Toys \u0027R\u0027 Us  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/31/16/toysrus.jpg","title":"brexit latest uk business financial distress economy begbies traynor","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

In a highly\u0026nbspcompetitive sector, it\u0027s\u0026nbspthe sort of thing that could drive them out of business. And the improvement certainly isn’t anything to shout about when put in the context of how important the service has become and the impact that the poor performance of broadband providers can have on iniduals and their businesses.\u0026nbspThe regulator has correctly recognised that action is necessary to correct their collective failure.\u0026nbspThe regular publication of the figures is a part of that, but it has also recently taken more concrete steps. \u0026nbspPerhaps its most important reform is the demand that firms automatically compensate customers when they suffer outages or are hit with delays. This also applies if engineers schedule appointments and don’t turn up. Customers are being given more and better information about the speeds they can expect when they sign up, and the power to walk away form contracts if they have a problem.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAll this means that firms that fail to shape up could find themselves facing a significant financial penalty. Bad news for TalkTalk in particular. It again found itself at the bottom of the service league table.Ofcom\u0026nbspalso wants to show its charges a carrot as well as a stick. It hopes that firms scoring more highly will be rewarded with more business.But do people look at Ofcom’s scores and factor them in when choosing a broadband provider? Is there enough differentiation between the firms at the top and those at the bottom to have a meaningful impact on the business they bring in?The figures would suggest otherwise and the industry’s fairly dismal reputation may\u0026nbspserve to put people off switching full stop. Who wants to risk going without broadband for several days, even with the\u0026nbsppromise of compensation if it happens?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This information can help buyers make the right decision.”A Plusnet spokesperson said: “We’d like to apologise to our customers as we know this isn’t the service they’ve come to expect from us.“We worked with Ofcom to keep them informed and to ensure our customers received the best service through this difficult time.“This report refers to complaints during that time in October to December since then we’ve been working hard to get things back on track and the most recent complaints data shows that we are heading in the right direction.”TalkTalk said: “We’re pleased that Ofcom’s data again shows an improving trend for the number of complaints received about TalkTalk. And while some of the results in the quality of service report are disappointing, we are already seeing more customers than ever staying with us.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They include private chats that the company says it can\u0027t read, in addition to new ways of talking to friends.Facebook\u0027s redesign will help make it an easier way to find groups and other new features of the site, the company said.But it also brings an entirely new look, one of the most dramatic redesigns of how the homepage looks on computers since it was launched. Mark Zuckerberg noted that the app isn\u0027t even blue anymore, which is also true of the website.The Facebook icon has also been changed to make it more lively and modern, Mr Zuckerberg said.As well as the visual redesign, the new website and app\u0027s look also come with a variety of changes underneath, which should allow them to load more quickly and more efficiently.Facebook said the redesign and the focus on groups were part of its mission to become the public square of the internet. But it also acknowledged that it was part of a plan to rescue the company\u0027s reputation from the various problems it has faced in recent weeks.People have always come to Facebook to connect with friends and family, but over time it\u0027s become more than that – it’s also a place to connect with people who share your interests and passions, Facebook said in a release.\u0026nbspToday we’re making changes that put Groups at the center of Facebook and sharing new ways Facebook can help bring people together offline.The change will arrive straight away in the Facebook app, and the new desktop version will come in the next few months, Facebook said.Facebook now has tens of millions of active groups, and more than 400 million people belong to them, it said.Alongside the redesign, Facebook will add a host of new tools aimed at making it easier to be a part of groups.It has an improved discovery tool, that will feature better recommendations, to let people find groups they might be interested in more easily.It will also now be easier to share to those groups, Facebook said. Users will be able to share anything they find directly into groups from the news feed, just like happens now with sharing to friends and family.There will also be a host of new features specifically tailored to members of different kinds of groups. In Health Support groups, for instance, users will be able to ask questions or post information without having their name attached to it job groups will feature new templates to advertise for postings gaming groups will allow people to chat within the group itself and buy and sell groups will let people more easily ask questions and buy things.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it could eventually roll out to all users, leaving them unable to see how many likes their posts get.People will still be able to see when someone likes their posts, and clicking through will show everyone who has done so. But the only way to find out how many of them there are would be manually counting up, since Instagram will no longer show the big number next to the post.“Later this week, we’re running a test in Canada that removes the total number of likes on photos and video views in Feed, Permalink pages and Profile,” an Instagram spokesperson told\u0026nbspTechCrunch, which first reported the news. “We are testing this because we want your followers to focus on the photos and videos you share, not how many likes they get.Many influencers and other people who are paid to post on Facebook use the like metric as an important way of understanding how popular and engaging a post is. Those numbers can then affect how much brands will pay them to post, making likes an important number for those users.Facebook quietly announces exposure of millions of Instagram passwordsInstagram said it was aware that hiding the likes could therefore be financially difficult for many Instagram users. It told Techcrunch it was thinking through ways for them to communicate value to their brand partners and that the idea was still in its exploratory stages.As anxiety about the damage social media is doing to people\u0027s mental health and wellbeing has spread, the idea of removing some of the more obvious and competitive markers of a person\u0027s popularity has spread. The idea has gathered support from people including Kanye West, who last year sent a flurry of posts about the damage that like counters were doing to social media users.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

its first self-service outlet with no checkouts, what does it mean for Britain’s retail sector which employs more than any other part of the economy?Click to followThe IndependentStarting this week, shoppers at Sainsbury’s in High Holborn simply scan their own items using an app and then walk outAt a small, central London branch of Sainsbury’s, one mainstay of the traditional supermarket is notable by its absence: checkouts.Starting this week, shoppers in the High Holborn\u0026nbspbranch will simply scan their own items using an app and then walk out.\u0026nbspThe supermarket giant plans to use the trial to develop the app which it says will make grocery shopping quicker and more convenient.\u0026nbspBut it highlights a deepening trend towards fewer tills and ultimately fewer staff.So what might a new till-less future mean for British supermarkets and, more specifically, for the 2.7 million people who work in the retail industry?There’s little doubt stripping out tills from supermarkets will mean fewer jobs in retail, a sector that employs more than any other in the UK, comfortably ahead of the next largest employer, construction, with 1.8 million.Sainsbury’s has said the\u0026nbspnew setup merely frees up staff to spend time on the shop floor helping out customers and stocking shelves.\u0026nbspBut it would defy business logic to think retailers will keep on all of the 200,000 cashiers estimated to work in the UK when the need for them disappears.Created with Sketch.Ageing Japan: Robots\u0027 role in future of elderly care Show all 15Created with

biggest costs and one which they need to cut if they are to face up to the looming challenge of online retailers, including the mighty Amazon.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that around two-thirds of cashier jobs are at high risk of being replaced by technology. That would mean around 135,000 jobs disappearing.The new store format is more evolution than revolution.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s\u0026nbsphas already trialled its self-service app in other convenience stores and rivals including Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the\u0026nbspCo-op have piloted\u0026nbsptheir own equivalents.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, thousands of supermarket jobs have already gone at all of the big players as they battle discount chains like Lidl and Aldi which employ fewer checkout staff.It won’t have escaped anyone’s notice that supermarkets increasingly rely on self-service checkouts. The self-scan app is the next step on\u0026nbspthat trend.Why shell out on expensive till technology when most shoppers now have a portable barcode scanner in their pocket in the form of their smartphone?So the trend towards automation is well established, but it still has a long way to go.Large parts of the supply chain that brings food (and other products) to our doors could also be automated within the next decade or so.With artificial intelligence, self-driving vehicles and robots, the technology to replace lorry drivers,\u0026nbspwarehouse workers and administrative staff is already here.\u0026nbspPerhaps half of jobs related to retail could be automated as that technology improves and costs comes down, according to some estimates.Created with Sketch.

Improving the efficiency of one of the most important parts of the economy should be welcomed and new jobs will be created as old ones disappear. But the impact of these changes depends hugely on how the process\u0026nbspis managed.\u0026nbspAutomation is frequently referred to as the “fourth industrial revolution”.The government must play a much more proactive role than in previous upheavals, actively forecasting the changes and proactively helping those affected into training and alternative employment rather than hiding behind the excuse that “market forces” will work their magic.It seems likely that they will, but that shop floor workers will still have a significant, if reduced, part to play.\u0026nbspUltimately it will come down to shoppers’ preferences. After all, supermarkets introduced (non-smartphone-based) self-scan apps in the\u0026nbsp1990s\u0026nbspbut the idea never really took off.Will we be willing to pay a little extra to go to a shop that has a few more staff that we can ask for assistance or will we go for the cheapest option?\u0026nbspThere’s almost certainly room for both. As many retailers well know, price is an important determinant of consumer behaviour but it is far from being the only one.\u0026nbspTherefore, there will be room for a no-frills, no-tills shopping experience\u0026nbspalongside more traditional offerings, perhaps with a relatively small number of highly knowledgeable retail assistants that online rivals can’t offer.Traditional retailers are increasingly switching on to the fact that our experiences\u0026nbspof shopping in a real-life store – the sights, sounds, textures and personal interactions – are their key advantage.So a future where we glide in solitary fashion through\u0026nbspthe aisles filling up our baskets without ever interacting with\u0026nbspanyone seems – thankfully – a little way off yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While the subject has long been the preserve of big-budget action films, he said: “What we’re doing is very serious.”“We have to make sure that people understand that this is not about Hollywood, it’s not about movies,” he said.

The huge blast it created as it entered injured more than 1,500 people, and damaged over 7,000 buildings.Statistically, meteor events of that size happen once every 60 years, but Bridenstine pointed out there have been three such incidents over the last 100 years.Chelyabinsk in 2013 (AP PhotoChelyabinsk.ru)On the very same day as the Chelyabinsk Event, another, even larger asteroid, measuring 100 feet across and known as “Duende” passed the Earth.“We are fortunate that it missed,” Mr Bridenstine said. It is forecast to fly past Earth again in 2123.“We have to use our systems, use our capabilities to ultimately get a lot more data, and we have to do it faster,” he added.“We know for a fact that the dinosaurs did not have a space programme. But we do, and we need to use it.”Nasa has been directed by the US government to detect and track 90 per cent of near-Earth objects 460 feet or larger. But there are an estimated 25,000 objects in this category, and the agency has only catalogued about one third of them to date. First ever ‘Marsquake’ detected by Nasa InSight lander‘Strange blue lights’ spotted over Arctic Circle explained by NasaHuge meteor explosion above Earth’s surface detected by NasaMeteor explosion over Bristol caught on camera by astronomerMr Bridenstine said tackling large asteroids which posed a threat to Earth required more resources and more countries needed to work to build more powerful rockets like Nasa’s Space Launch System, which will be the most powerful rocket it has ever built. He said this was necessary “so that ultimately, when discoveries are made, and risk needs to be mitigated, we have more options than we would otherwise have.” The Space Launch system is to be used for the next manned mission to the Moon in 2024. Nasa is also working on a joint project with Elon Musk’s Space X company to test their ability to deflect threatening meteors.The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) will send a rocket to collide with a near-Earth asteroid in an attempt to change its path.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This came after an initial run during which members of the Nazi Party disrupted screenings by releasing mice into the cinema and, at one stage, attacking Jewish audience members. Censors in Austria, Australia, Italy and France also banned the film in the early 1930s.Many might find Clint Eastwood\u0027s American Sniper (2015) to be something of an insult, but Iran banned the war drama – based on the life of the US military\u0027s deadliest marksman – for being just that. Censors deemed it offensive to its nation.The anti-war sentiment present in Francis Ford Coppola\u0027s Apocalypse Now saw the film banned under President Park Chung-hee\u0027s regime in 1979.Ben Affleck\u0027s Best Picture-winning 2012 drama Argo was banned in Iran due to its negative portrayal of the country.Finnish censors believed that Sergei Eisenstein\u0027s 1925 Soviet silent film Battleship Potemkin would incite a Communist revolution, so gave the film an outright ban.746 Beauty and the Beast (2017)Disney\u0027s live-action remake of its 1991 classic was banned in Kuwait due to homosexual references involving the character LeFou (Josh Gad). It evaded a ban in Russia after being slapped with a 16+ age certificate and in Malaysia after having the references cut altogether.China banned William Wyler\u0027s religious epic Ben-Hur in 1959 under the regime of Mao Zedong for containing propaganda of superstitious beliefs, namely Christianity. While most films go on to have their ban lifted, the country has never given the Oscar-winner permission to be shown.It turns out there are some people who don\u0027t find Sacha Baron Cohen that funny, notably officials in all Arab countries (except Lebanon) who banned his 2006 comedy Borat for being too offensive.Officials in the Catholic country of Ireland found David Lean\u0027s romantic drama Brief Encounter to be too accepting of adultery to be shown in cinemas.The homosexual relationship at the centre of Ang Lee\u0027s 2005 drama Brokeback Mountain saw the film banned in all Arab countries bar Lebanon, where it was released in a censored format.The number of banned films in North Korea runs pretty high, but an unexpected feature on the list is the Tom Hardy-starring Child 44 (2015). Countries including Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Belarus all followed suit.Censors in China denied the release of Disney\u0027s Christopher Robin in 2008 because the character of Winnie the Pooh has become a symbol of resistance against the country’s ruling Communist Party and its leader Xi Jinping.Stanley Kubrick met a lot of opposition with A Clockwork Orange in 1971. While the film was never banned outright in the UK (it was withdrawn at the director\u0027s request after his family received death threats because of it), it wasn\u0027t shown in cinemas in Ireland, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea due to its depictions of violence and gang rape. It wasn\u0027t screened in the UK until after Kubrick\u0027s death in 1999.The high-profile adaptation of Dan Brown\u0027s novel The Da Vinci Code was banned in (take a deep breath) China, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Samoa and Solomon Islands due to content deemed blasphemous.The Danish Girl, Tom Hooper\u0027s film inspired by the life of transgender painter Lili Elbe, was banned in Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait and Malaysia on grounds of moral depravity in 2015.After it was decided that Deadpool couldn\u0027t be edited without affecting its plot, Chinese officials initially banned the film citing explicit content. Uzbekistan followed suit as the film violated the country\u0027s societal norms, while it received heavy editing in order to be shown in India.1846 The Death of Stalin (2017)Armando Iannucci\u0027s 2017 comedy The Death of Stalin failed to make the cut in Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan because of its perceived anti-Soviet theme.Martin Scorsese\u0027s crime thriller The Departed hit a nerve with China in 2006 thanks to a line of dialogue that suggested its government intends to use nuclear weapons on Taiwan, a sensitive issue for the country. The ban has never been lifted.District 9, Neill Blomkamp\u0027s science-fiction film from 2009, was slapped with a ban in Nigeria due to accusations of being xenophobic and racist towards its citizens.2146 Fifty Shades of Grey (2015)The adaptation of EL James\u0027s erotic drama Fifty Shades of Grey may not have been as raunchy as some were hoping, but it was considered too explicit for audiences in Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, United Arab Emirates and Zimbabwe.   William Wyler\u0027s romantic musical Funny Girl was banned in Egypt because its male lead Omar Sharif – an Egyptian Muslim – is shown in a romantic storyline with the Jewish Barbra Streisand, who was vocal in her political support for Israel at the height of military tensions with Egypt in 1968.Paul Feig\u0027s all-female reboot of Ghostbusters was denied a release in China due to censorship laws prohibiting the promotion of cults and superstitions. Not even changing the title to Super Power Dare-to-Die Team (yes, really) could help its cause. Sean Connery\u0027s third film as British spy James Bond, Goldfinger (1964), had been released in Israel for six weeks when it was revealed that one of its main actors, Gert Fröbe, had a Nazi past. It had the ban lifted when a Jewish survivor came forward with the revelation that his life and his mother\u0027s were probably saved after being hidden from the Nazis by Fröbe.The country of Vietnam deemed the numerous murders shown in blockbuster The Hunger Games too violent for teenage audiences and decided to slap the film with an outright ban.2646 Jules and Jim (1962)François Truffaut\u0027s beloved French drama Jules and Jim found itself at the centre of a ban in Italy for its attitudes toward sex.

Ian Murray, a former shadow Scottish secretary, said backing for a Final Say referendum had been “upheld at last”.“Given there won’t be a general election and the Tories will not agree customs union and single market, the @UKLabour EU manifesto commits to a public vote,” he tweeted.May to abandon Brexit talks with Labour if no deal by next weekBen Bradshaw, a leading pro-referendum Labour MP, echoed the message, tweeting: “There won’t be an election cos Tory MPs won’t vote for one. #peoplesvote only thing left. Bingo!”Labour’s pro-EU wing was also pleased that the party would now have to rapidly rewrite the controversial European election leaflet which made no mention of a fresh referendum.Mr Corbyn’s office had been confident of resisting a shift to supporting a further referendum in all circumstances, enjoying the support of at least 22 of the 39 members of the NEC.He could rely on the backing of the giant Unite union, despite other big unions – including the GMB, Unison and Usdaw – swinging behind another public vote.Change UK urges pro-EU Labour members to \u0027lend\u0027 them supportWhy has May set a deadline for a Brexit deal compromise with Labour?Corbyn’s taste for Brexit fudge leaves us facing a national traumaTop Brexit Party candidate condemned for past defence of IRA bombingBut more than 20 Labour MEP candidates had defied their leadership by pledging to back a referendum and then campaign to remain in the EU.And a letter from MPs and MEPs calling for a public vote on any Brexit deal has reached 118 signatories, meaning the majority of non-shadow cabinet MPs back it.Earlier, Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, walked out of a shadow cabinet meeting after Mr Corbyn refused to allow its members to see the draft referendum policy, ahead of the NEC gathering.Following the meeting, a Labour source said: “The NEC agreed the manifesto which will be fully in line with Labour’s existing policy to support Labour’s alternative plan, and if we can’t get the necessary changes to the government’s deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don’t sponsor a particular point of view or finding.”The tweet’s popularity was partly driven by online commenters wondering whether the post was a joke.“Is this some prank?”\u0026nbspSmita\u0026nbspBarooah, a Twitter user, asked.Yeti mystery finally solved by scientists“Maybe something out of the box to draw attention to their expedition?”“This is deeply, deeply embarrassing,” Praveen\u0026nbspSwami, group consulting editor at Indian media company Network18, wrote.“Whoever in the Indian army’s PR has circulated this is disgracing the institution, and India, in the world’s eyes.”A politician from the ruling Bharatiya Janata\u0026nbspParty (BJP) was also mocked for asking the army\u0026nbspto stop\u0026nbspcalling the yeti a “beast”.Tarun Vijay asked the army to use more respectful language.“Congratulations, we are always proud of you,” he\u0026nbspwrote, in response to the organisation’s Twitter post.“But please, you are Indian, don’t call yeti as beast. Show respect for them...he is a ‘snowman’.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The party is polling around 10 per cent to 12 per cent for the European elections next month, slightly down on its other scores.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Salvini was tagged in the post.\u0026nbspThe viral image was widely shared after Italian activist Marco Furfaro posted it on Facebook alongside the caption: “Caltanissetta protesters. Love beats hate 3-0. Trolling Salvini to the extreme. You rock Gaia and Matilde.”The hashtag #GaiaeMatilde – the names of the two young women in the photo – has gained traction on Twitter.Gaia can be seen appearing to attempt to take another photo kissing her friend after taking the first one but a security agent appears to swiftly place their hand in the way in order to separate the two young women.“The hand of another friend that ides,” says the caption of an image which can be seen on her Instagram Stories.Mr Salvini has been mocked in the wake of the image – with an influx of memes\u0026nbsppoking fun at the expression on his face. Others have hailed the women’s “brave” and “glorious” protest.“When the minister urged those present to take the stage and take a selfie with him, we had this idea because he participated in World Congress of Families as a minister,” Gaia, who has only been identified by her first name, told Euronews.\u0026nbsp“We made a provocative instinctive gesture, not at all premeditated. On stage, Salvini did not expect us to take a picture like this. When we kissed, an agent I think, separated us sharply and Salvini then told us ‘I wish you luck’ so we took off thanking him ironically.”Campaigners argue women’s rights are being rolled back\u0026nbspunder Mr Salvini and\u0026nbsptraditional stereotypes about the role of women are also worsening.The political leader was fiercely criticised after neither he nor any Minister from the League chose to attend national celebrations which sees Italy mark\u0026nbspthe liberation from fascism on 25 April each year.Campaigners protest against \u0027medieval\u0027 anti-abortion summit in ItalyLast week, Italian media documented neo-fascist demonstrations, desecrations of memorials of participants of the Italian resistance against fascism, and drawings of swastikas across the country.

Idealistic young voters are all ears.There is a solution to our looming energy crisis — cheap, clean shale gas. But feeble Energy Secretary Greg Clark threw it away, forcing fracking tsar Natascha Engel to quit yesterday in disgust.After nine dithering years in power, with no idea how to keep the lights on, this Government is damned now whichever way it jumps.Protesters claiming “The End Is Nigh” are swarming like angry wasps.Their claims may be simplistic and sometimes , but they have been nailed on Netflix by national treasure Sir David Attenborough and hammered home by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg.Jezza is using these crowd-pullers to turn dull carbon emissions into a glittering crusade — a national emergency no less.His Momentum Marxists are tutoring the Extinction Rebellion protesters who gridlocked London and turned -year-old Greta into a global warming superstar. The Tories have nothing to say.Gutless Clark abandoned fracking contractors who risked hundreds of million only to see Project Shale strangled at birth.Engel’s walk-out should surprise nobody. I received a frantic call from the ex-Labour MP weeks ago warning about “nonsense” rules which stop fracking at the slightest tremor.She told me: “This is a real threat to the industry and means buying more Russian gas.” Her argument doesn’t wash with Jezza’s anti-capitalist anarchists, Greta or Blue Planet’s Sir David, who between them now run UK energy policy.Arguments for shale have been drowned out by images of raging bushfires, tidal waves and an Apocalypse Now soundtrack.Saint David’s bell tolls, and it tolls for the Tories.Climate change is the issue of the day. They have thrown in the towel on this as on so much .Greta Thunberg is Sweden’s new dancing queen, upstaging gas-guzzling hypocrite Emma Thompson and treating Britain’s top ministers with withering sarcasm.They were doing NOTHING to reduce carbon emissions, she spat. In truth, Britain is leading Europe, at huge cost, in reducing carbon emissions while replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy. Wind and solar energy are replacing coal.It is also a fact, courtesy of the respected Intergovern- mental Panel On Climate Change, that global warming is not about to roast us all alive or drown us beneath stormy oceans.Polar bears are multiplying, not disappearing. Walruses are thriving, not throwing themselves off rocks.None of this washes with single-issue, black-and-white zealots who regard all inconvenient truth as the work of the Devil. I am no climate change denier. We are polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.If I ruled the world, Russia, China, India and America would not turn oceans and rivers into chemical sewers.I would ban plastic dumping, save sea le from being choked or poisoned and halt deforestation and desert- ication. But I don’t rule the world, and nor does Saint David or Greta Thunberg — or the hundreds of, let’s say, well-intentioned young folk who think paralysing London is the next best thing.Britain deserves credit for cutting carbon emissions further and faster than most EU countries.Temperatures are rising, but not by Extinction Rebellion or Miss Thunberg’s worst-case projections.Evangelical followers want an end to air travel except when they go skiing.Everything must come by sea even though shipping is a highly polluting form of transport.We must grow our own food, putting farmers in poor countries out of a job and workers here on the dole.WARREN BUFFETT, the legendary Sage of Omaha, has amassed billions putting his money where his mouth is.He thinks Britain, with its rule of law and decent, hard-working citizens is the world’s best place to invest, regardless of Brexit.He’s not alone. Once Brexit is settled, a wall of money will be unleashed by firms at home and abroad who have been sitting on the fence for three years.There is only one fly in the ointment – the prospect of anti-Semitic, US-hating, terrorist-backing Jeremy Corbyn as our next PM.Jezza’s much brighter brother Piers deserves a final say on this sudden burst of mass hysteria and Greta worship.“Listening to an ignorant, brainwashed child is deranged,” he tweets. “I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It could also hand Britain an economic boom, and reduce our dependence on energy imports from far-flung dictatorships.Cowardly Business Secretary Greg Clark is squandering this windfall by giving in to the green lobby. As Engel says — listen to the science, not just to those who shout the loudest.At least the Tories aren’t quite as bad as Jeremy Corbyn, who would ban fracking altogether and destroy hundreds of jobs in the process.It is time the Government ignored leftie posturing and turned on the shale gas taps.THE five thugs suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence have repeatedly dodged justice. So it’s an outrage they’ve been allowed to run up nearly £million in legal aid — funded, of course, by the taxpayer.Gary Dobson and David Norris lied for  years before finally being convicted of murder, while the other three have always refused to explain their role in the racist attack on Stephen.Of course every suspect has the right to a defence, but it can’t be fair that such sums have been lavished on lawyers for these fundamentally dishonest men.Contrast this state-funded generosity with the treatment of Stephen’s grieving parents, who were denied legal aid when trying to get justice for their son.Coming hot on the heels of Shamima Begum’s legal aid windfall, this is fresh proof the system isn’t working. Legal aid is meant to ensure the right to a fair trial, not help killers avoid being held to account.LEEDS United boss Marcelo Bielsa has restored faith in modern football.His players were wrong to score against Aston Villa while their opponents had a man down injured, but he immediately put it right by gting Villa an equaliser.You could see on Bielsa’s face how much it hurt. The gesture was the final nail in the coffin for Leeds’ automatic promotion challenge — and an incredible example for footie-mad kids who need to know the importance of fair play.In an era where sport stars hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons, it’s heart-warming to see a team go about things the right way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its author is not your standard liberal conscience, ­cloistered in Whitehall or a university sociology department.  Baroness Helen Newlove knows only too well what it is like to be a victim of crime.Twelve years ago she was an ordinary mum living in a suburb of Warrington, Cheshire, when her husband left their home to confront a group of drunken youths who were vandalising his car. He never ed.He was kicked and beaten so savagely that he later died in hospital.What was especially galling for his we and three daughters was that the three youths responsible —  who were each jailed for le — had been the ­subject of numerous complaints.One of those jailed for Garry’s murder had already been on an assault charge but had been released on bail just a few hours earlier to resume his le ­terrorising local residents.Neither police, prosecutors nor the courts seemed to appreciate just how far out of control the youths had become.They failed to put together numerous complaints of antisocial behaviour to see the overall picture. As a result, the problem was allowed to escalate to its murderous conclusion.Sadly, to judge by Baroness Newlove’s report, too little has changed in the years since her first husband’s ­murder. Still, she says, police are treating complaints about anti- social behaviour as isolated incidents, each dismissed as “low-level crime”.A vandalised car is treated as a problem to be sorted out with an insurance claim.  Youths riding motorbikes round a children’s playground might be challenged by police on one ­occasion but it is never followed up.  Dope-smoking seems effectively to have been legalised, the police ­having all but given up even speaking to those involved. At the same time, incidents of antisocial behaviour are  rising sharply.Last year,  per cent of people responding to the British Crime Survey — an annual poll of more than , randomly-selected Britons — reported witnessing antisocial behaviour, up from . per cent the year before.This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.In  the Government introduced what it called a “community trigger” — which was supposed to give residents the right to demand greater actionthree or more separate reports on antisocial behaviour were received within a six-month period.Residents can demand a “case review”, at which the authorities must explain what action they intend to take.Yet in half of local authority areas, says Newlove, the community trigger process was not used during  .Newlove also has a gripe with the police  service — the non-emergency number introduced in .  It was ­supposed to encourage us to report non-le-threatening incidents for which we might be reluctant to call .But, as I found from my own experience, it seems to be used as a means of fobbing us off.When I came across someone stealing from a pile of wood by the roadside I rang the number —  but it took ages to have the call answered and even when it was, nothing  happened, even though I had taken down the registration plate of the thieves’  vehicle.To cap the insult, while  calls are free it costs p to call .Of course, police can’t be expected to deal with and solve every single crime. I know that officer numbers have fallen and that in some areas they are struggling with an epidemic of kne murders, which obviously needs to take priority.Butyou give people the impression that you are no longer even bothering to try to police “low-level” crime, you are just inviting the problem to escalate.It isn’t just the police, however, who are responsible for the lack of action on antisocial behaviour. Local authorities have filled their town centres with enforcement officers, who merrily hand out £ fines for the smallest misdemeanours, such as dropping fag ends.Yet the private firms trusted with ­dealing with litter louts — and who are disgracefully often employed on contracts which incentivise them to hand out as many fines as  possible — are not  interested in policing housing estates.They are only interested in what they find profitable — dishing out fines to soft targets in shopping centres.Serious antisocial behaviour of the sort which preceded Garry Newlove’s murder falls between two stools — it is considered too much bother for enforcement officers but not serious enough for police investigation.But as Baroness Newlove knows only too well, turning a blind eye to repeated antisocial behaviour makes the lives of residents a misery and can end up ­having fatal consequences.The Government has been quick to respond to proposals from the usual bleeding-heart liberals who seem to run the criminal justice system — recently agreeing, for example, to look into ­abolishing prison sentences of less than six months.Ministers must take note of what the outgoing Victims’ Commissioner is saying on the lax approach to antisocial ­behaviour and put the interests of the victims, not criminals, first. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The party’s ruling body took more than five hours to thrash out a compromise in a bid to unite warring Labour MPs for now.  The National Executive Committee agreed Labour’s manesto for the EU elections would not include a firm pledge for a fresh public vote.  Mr Corbyn hopes that the decision will help him fight off a full-blown attack from Nigel Farage’s Brexit party at the polls. But Labour’s Remain-supporting MPs and membership wanted the party to take a much clearer pro-referendum line.   “The NEC agreed the manesto which will be fully in line with Labour’s existing policy to support Labour’s alternative plan and,we can’t get the necessary changes to the Government’s deal, or a general election, to back the option of a public vote,” a source said.    Leading party figures, including deputy leader Tom Watson, had been pushing for a new Brexit vote in all circumstamces. Some pro-referendum MPs hailed the decision as the first time a second referendum will appear in a Labour manesto.  They believe that the Government and Labour will fail to reach agreement on Brexit and a general election is off the cards - so Mr Corbyn will be forced to pivot to a second referendum.   Ilford North MP Wes Streeting said: “Glad the NEC has made the right call and confirmed that a public vote will be in our manesto for the European elections.  “We’re a party for Remain and it’s right that everyone - Leavers and Remainers - should be given the final say on our Brexit future.”    But others were furious at the failure of the party to agree a stronger policy. Sunderland MP Bridget Phillipson said Labour had “done the bare minimum needed and I can only hope it will be enough to secure the support of all those millions of our voters demanding the final say on Brexit”. Outgoing London Labour MEP Mary Honeyball added: “Looks like Labour NEC has agreed business as usual. Not good enough.” The party is now understood to be rewriting its controversial European election leaflet so that it includes the option of a fresh vote. Labour MPs with Leave seats denied that the manesto decision made a referendum inevitable.  Gloria de Piero, MP for Ashford said: “Labour’s manesto for the European Parliament will not contain a pledge to hold a second Brexit referendum.  “The party’s ruling national executive committee agreed that another nationwide poll should only be “an option”it cannot force a general election.” Sources close to the party leadership had claimed that they were pushing for the manesto to reflect Labour’s existing policy which keeps the option of a second referendum on the table. But ahead of the NEC’s decision Mr Watson said “the context has changed” since the  party conference and Labour should now throw its full support behind a new vote “to heal the ide in the country”. Earlier, he walked out of a shadow cabinet meeting after the leadership refused to hand out copies of the manesto. Sources close to Mr Corbyn were relieved an attempt by the TSSA union to push for a second referendum on “any” Brexit deal failed.  Many party members want Labour to make its agreement in cross-party talks with the Government conditional on a public vote.  The Labour leader and all nine Momentum reps voted against the amendment, which was supported by around a dozen of the  NEC members. TSSA chief Manuel Cortes said: “Sadly, it doesn’t appear that there is anything straight talking about Labour’s latest Brexit fudge”. A Labour spokeswoman said: “Labour is the only party which represents both people who supported leave and remain. We are working to bring the country together after the chaos and crisis created by the Tories.” Meanwhile, the Government is planning to pull the plug on cross-party Brexit talks next Wednesdaythere is no breakthrough next week, sources claimed.  Senior figures from the Tories and Labour will resume negotiations on Tuesday, after the Back Holiday weekend, after early signs of compromise earlier this week.  However, both sides remained downbeat about the chances of striking a deal in time to allow ministers to scrap planned European elections on May . Five weeks will have passed since Brexit was due to take place and both main parties will have seen the results of Thursday’s local elections in England, which are set to be overshadowed by the ongoing EU withdrawal crisis.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the Government risks losing Tory supportit agrees a customs union plan in the Brexit talks - the most controversial area for compromise.  “If we were proposing, which I very much hope we don’t, to sign up to the customs union, then I think there is a risk that you would lose more Conservative MPs than you would gain Labour MPs,” he said.  It comes as Mrs May faces a high-powered group of MPs on Wednesday who are expected to quiz her on her plans to break the Brexit deadlock.  If the talks break down, ministers are planning to give  MPs another series of votes on Brexit options, though this time using a preferential system so that they are forced to agree on at least option. Government insiders hope this would pit Mrs May’s own proposal into a run-off with the next favourite option - probably a softer Brexit - and focus the minds of Tory Brexiteer rebels to finally back her deal.

Sir Stephen Sedley warns the “opaque” way the benefit is paid forces hard-up families to “guess and grope” at whether payments are correct. That feeds into poor claimants’ “stress and worry” and affects their children, the Court of Appeal judge from  to  says. He accuses the six-in-one benefit of a “systemic failure to meet basic standards”, adding: “None of this is compatible with the rule of law.” Sir Stephen’s damning statement is part of a charity report that warns the “opaque and inadequate” UC system is leaving families “in the dark”. The Child Poverty Action Group studied the decision to issue a single monthly UC payment, with only a “basic” breakdown of how it was worked out.    This “inadequate” information means many of the UK’s .million UC claimants don’t knowthere has been a mistake, CPAG said. Of , cases flagged to the charity’s Early Warning System, a fth involved an administrative error by the Department for Work and Pensions . In one case, a man with terminal cancer struggled by for several months with £ a month less than he was owed until an advisor spotted the error. In another case a grandmother only discovered she was being wrongly charged the Bedroom Tax after six months. In another, a working mum with two part-time jobs only found about errors costing her £ a month after she saw a welfare rights advisor. In a foreword to the report, Sir Stephen wrote: “There is something Orwellian about a system which is intended to alleviate hardship yet is administered in ways which generate and aggravate human misery.”  Sir Stephen said it is a “fundamental principle” that government decisions must be clearly explained and open to appeal. But “the DWP is repeatedly falling down on every element of these public law obligations in its administration of Universal Credit,” he wrote. He warned the “opaque” system makes it “hard to comprehend” how much of each month’s payment is for housing costs or childcare. In turn that makes the final amount dficult to challenge, leading to “disaster” where the DWP gets it wrong, he wrote. “People in need are left to guess at and grope for things which should be clear and tangible,” he wrote. According to the report, UC helpline staff were often unable to explain how a claimant’s award was worked out because it was processed automatically. CPAG called for more information to be put in claimants’ monthly statements, including a full breakdown of how each payment was calculated.  And it demanded the UC online account, through which people manage their claim, is redesigned to put all key decisions in one place. CPAG Chief Executive Alison Garnham said: “Transparency should be a the heart of a fair social security system. But our research shows Universal Credit claimants do not always understand the amounts they’re getting. “That is all the more worrying as the number of universal credit claims is set to double this year to million. “The scope for misunderstandings, omissions and errors is vast.” A DWP spokesperson said: “More than . million claimants receive a monthly statement advising them of their entitlement, how it has been calculated and what to dothey think the payment is incorrect. “Help is also available from work coaches, the freephone Universal Credit helpline, gov.uk and through our ‘Help to Claim’ partnership with Citizens Advice.”  Meanwhile MPs sound the alarm today over a trial that will move , existing benefit claimants over to Universal Credit. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee says the DWP must prove it is “up to the job” before beginning the pilot of so-called ‘managed migration’, which kicks off in Harrogate in July. After the trial, million existing benefit claimants will migrate to UC from a delayed start date of summer  up to December . But Committee chairman Frank Field warned even the pilot scheme must not start until further tests have been carried out to ensure it works. He said the DWP “is yet to prove it’s up to the job” of preventing “messes” that slash people’s income or cut their le chances.

The formal notication comes a week after activists passed the threshold to trigger the meeting.Leave-backers - who are furious with Mrs Mayaposs decision to delay Brexit to October  and enter apossoft dealapos talks with Labour - had been pushing for the meeting so they can stage a vote of no confidence in the Tory leader.They used rules which say the National Conservative Convention must call an EGMat least  chairman of local constituency associations demand one in a petition.That threshold was passed over Easter, with activists handing in a petition with more than  chairmanaposs signatures to the Convention secretary. While not legally binding, a no confidence vote at the Convention would heap political pressure on Mrs May to quit her post within weeks.Petition organiser Dinah Glover, who chairs London East Area Conservatives, told the Mirror last week: The longer Mrs May stays in No, the more Brexit is under threat.Such a move by grassroots Tories is said to be unprecedented in the partyaposs -year history. While non-binding, losing the vote would put huge pressure on Mrs May to step down. Talks between senior Tory minsters and Labour figures are continuing, ostensibly to break the Commons impasse over Brexit.However, Mrs Mayaposs handling of Brexit, along with discussions with Labour, has enraged Tory activists and translated into problems for the party on the doorstep.  Mrs May was reportedly made aware of the news personally on Monday night by the head of the National Conservative Convention Andrew Sharpe, who is also a deputy party chairman. The petition states that the signatories no longer feel that Mrs May is the right person to continue as Prime Minister to lead us forward in the negotiations. We therefore with great reluctance ask that she considers her position and resigns, it adds. Mrs May has already survived an internal attempt to oust her when backbenchers on the partyaposs  Committee launched a revolt in December. Under party rules, disgruntled MPs have to wait  months from a failed bid to try again in a fresh vote. Bids to shorten that period to six months have so far fallen flat. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned today against any attempt to get rid of Mrs May before a Brexit deal is passed by MPs. He told the Daily : The process of a Tory leadership election would inevitably involve candidates setting out their red lines which might itself mean that finding a compromise to get Brexit over the line becomes harder. Mrs May has pledged to step downand when her Brexit deal clears the Commons.

Only this time itaposs from a nondescript room in Labouraposs Westminster HQ where  party officials have been thrashing out a Brexit policy. Labour chiefs today agreed what the party will say about a second referendum in the May  EU elections. Labour WILL back a second referendum - but onlyit canapost get a general election or changes to Theresa Mayaposs deal. It was subject to a huge row in the run-up to the decision, with Tom Watson, who wanted Labour to go further, walking out of a meeting. Now that itaposs over, everyone is trying to claim victory. So what has actually been agreed and what does it mean  Hereaposs a quick guide.  Labour has agreed its Brexit manesto pledge for the European Parliament elections on May . The carefully-formed wording was signed off by the partyaposs -member ruling National Executive Committeeat a gruelling five-hour meeting today.The manesto will say Labour backs the option of a second referendum on Brexit - but only in certain circumstances. These areLabour canapost get a general election or canapost get the necessary changes to Theresa May ’s Brexit deal.Otherwise, Labour is still pushing ahead with its own Brexit plan. And talks with the Tory government about a compromise Brexit plan are continuing. Why is there a party row Remain figures, including deputy leader Tom Watson, wanted to go much further - by demanding a public vote onanyBrexit deal that is agreed.Under their plan, any deal would have been put to a confirmatory referendum letting the public choose between that deal and Remain. Pro-EU Labour backers sent more than , e-mails to the NEC urging them to back a confirmatory vote on any deal. The Unison, GMB and Usdaw unions - who all have NEC reps - also demanded the manesto included the policy, as did key members of the pro-Corbyn group Momentum. And more than  MPs and MEPs demanded it too. Who aposwonapos today  Allies of Jeremy Corbyn won a victory by ensuring the more nuanced wording went into the manesto. According to reports, Remain-backers on the NEC - led by the TSSA union - tried to pass an amendment that would have committed to a referendum onanyBrexit deal.But it was easily defeated, according to reports. The agreed plan means there will not be a public vote under all circumstances. Thataposs been branded a fudge by some Remainers and leaves much more wriggle room later on. However, it also acknowledges fears that becoming the aposreferendumapos or aposRemainapos party would alienate voters in Labouraposs northern heartlands. So why are Remain MPs claiming victory   Despite apparently losing the day, Remain MPs celebrated. Thataposs because they believe the necessary changes to Theresa Mayaposs deal wonapost be achieved - because talks with Labour have been grinding on for weeks. And that means in the end, Labour will be forced to back a public vote. A Remain-backing Labour MP told the Mirror: I can’t see how they will get the necessary changes. And in any case, the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs will not back a deal without a confirmatory vote attached. Simple as that. Numbers haven’t changed. Labour Remainer Ian Murray added: Given there wonapost be a general election and the Tories will agree customs union and single market, the manesto commits to a public vote. Theyaposre also relieved that the words public vote will appear in a Labour manesto - which, after all, is a big sht from the partyaposs stance a year ago. Labour Remainer Wes Streeting said the NEC had made the right call and confirmed that a public vote will be in our manesto. So... this means all things to all people   Yes. Compare the Remainersapos claims to Gloria De Piero, who represents a Leave seat. She said the manesto will not contain a pledge to hold a second referendum.Or Labouraposs many hard Remain enemies, like Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP leader said: Labour is a Brexit supporting party.Even second referendum campaigns Best For Britain and People’s Vote couldnapost agree whether Labour’s policy was a good thing. Best For Britain’s Naomi Smith said Labour has “come a long way” and is keeping second referendum as an option. But Labour MP Bridget Phillipson of People’s Vote said Labour has done the “bare minimum” with a “mealy-mouthed” manesto pledge. “Labour risks demoralising activists, depressing turnout among supporters and decreasing the share of the vote for candidates who - like the overwhelming majority of our party - are fighting for a People’s Vote on any Brexit deal,” she said. How does this relate to the conference policy   This all unfolded the way it did because of another careful bit of wording - agreed six months ago at Labouraposs party conference in Liverpool. Back then, Labour agreed:If we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote. If the Government is confident in negotiation a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.Youaposll notice todayaposs wording is a bit dferent, because it makes specic reference to getting necessary changes to the governmentaposs deal. So itaposs very much in the spirit of the conference policy, but moves it on and makes it a bit more specic. What does it mean for the EU elections  Labouraposs enemies on both sides will try and paint todayaposs decision in the worst possible light. Remain parties will say Labour is backing Brexit and Brexit parties will say the party is moving towards a second referendum. Both will have the benefit of being, at least partly, true. Today’s decision leaves the possibility that Labour MEP candidates could break ranks from the official aposparty lineapos in the EU election campiagn. By this morning  of Labouraposs  MEP candidates had signed a pledge to campaign for a referendum, then back efforts to remain in the EU.

Mr Kagouras strenuously denies being Islamaphobic. He said he has Muslim friends and merely opposes Islamic terrorism, adding that his tweets have been misunderstood because English is his second language. His posts, which have surfaced just two days before Thursdayaposs elections, will be particularly embarrassing for the Conservative Party as it battles allegations of institutional Islamaphobia as a result of racist online comments by party members. An M.E.N. analysis of Mr Kagourasaposs social media accounts shows repeated racist posts going back years, mostly directed at Muslims. On April , in reply to a story about ISIS fighter Shamima Begum, he wrote: “Iaposve been in Manchester since the s every year itaposs worse and worse. Now we have - no go areas, the P**i mile, and Cheetham Hill.”  A few weeks earlier, shortly before local election nominations had closed, he complained that Muslim preachers were playing ‘ISIS’ music on Market Street. On New Year’s Eve, months before being selected again by the party, he wrote in response to a post about Syrians living in Germany: “We allow it to happen. Now it is too late. We must prepare for religious war.” A few weeks before that, in reply to a story about German schools teaching children about headscarves, he wrote: How about teach the f*** [sic] Muslims how to get the f*** out of Europe before getting kicked out.In October, he tweeted that ‘by throwing out the white Europeans and the British whites not procreating you’re losing the battle against Islam’, adding that Brexit has ‘turned the British whites against the European whites’, rather than ‘against the one and only enemy… the Islam’.A month earlier, he said Europe should be given ‘back to the white people’, who he added were the ‘true and olny [sic] Europeans’.In August, he said Muslims were ‘murders’ [sic], while in November , he wrote: “This is Britain. F*** Muslims, and their mosques. Confiscate their British passports. Non [sic] of them is worthy of them send them back starting from the mayor of London, assumed to be a reference to Sadiq Khan . At around the same time, he complained on Twitter that he had been ‘banned’ from Facebook ‘for saying my opinion out loud’. He does still have an active Facebook page, however, which includes posts confirming his previous Conservative candidacy for Miles Platting and Newton Heath, at that time under the name Harry Kagouris.On Facebook a few weeks ago, he posted a picture of Adolf Hitler with Jeremy Corbyn ’s face superimposed on it, alongside a list of ways he claims the two are politically and personally alike.Mr Kagouras came eighth out of eight candidates in Cheetham during last year’s all-out local elections, polling .pc of the vote for the Tories. In  he came second in Miles Platting and Newton Heath with pc of the vote. A year earlier, when the Conservatives won the general election, he polled pc in the same ward. The Tories have been under growing pressure in recent weeks to tackle what Conservative Muslim peer Baroness Sayeeda Warsi called aposinstitutional racismapos in March, following the suspension of  members over offensive social media posts.  After being contacted by the M.E.N, a Conservative Party spokesman said the party had dropped Mr Kagouris, but added he would still have to be listed as a Tory on the ballot paper due to the last-minute nature of the decision. “Nominations for local government candidates have closed. Electoral law dictates that after the deadline has passed candidates cannot be removed from the ballot or their details changed, he said. However, Mr Kagouras is no longer a Conservative Party candidate and would not be allowed to join the Conservative groupelected. The Conservative Party does not tolerate any form of racism or discrimination and language such as this is totally unacceptable.” Mr Kagouras deleted his Twitter page soon after being contacted by the M.E.N.  Asked about his social media posts and the party’s decision, Mr Kagouris, who is originally from Greece, said in a message: “I am NOT Islamophobic. I have Muslim friends. “My country was occupied by the Ottoman Empire for  years and the new Turkish government murdered a million Greeks. “What I opposed is Islamist terrorism like ISIS, because my written English is NOT good some of my social media can be taken the wrong way.                                              “Iaposve been accused of homophobia, thataposs NOT true. I did tweet supporting marriage between man and woman. Is that wrong    “I am NOT racist I have friends from all over the world, in every city in the world. “The reality is that we living [sic] with people from everywhere. I accept that or I would NOT be living in Manchester. “The party dismissed me as a candidate and I now understand why, and I accept the decision.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tories use bob job scouts","story":"NewsTories use bob-a-job SCOUTS to deliver election leaflets sparking walkoutA row erupted after Scouts were used to deliver leaflets in LincolnshireShareCommentsByLucy Thornton:,  APR Updated:,  APR News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tories used scouts to deliver election leaflets sparking a mass walkout of pack leaders. A row erupted after Scouts were used to deliver election leaflets for Conservative candidates campaigning for district council seats. Infor their endeavours the scouts were promised money to rent allotment space to grow vegetables for a soup kitchen. But the deliveries led to leaders of Marshchapel troop in Lincolnshire quitting, after they breached scout rules - which state the organisation and its members are non-political. The youngsters have received an apology over the affair. The leaflets were to promote Conservative candidates Paul Rickett and Daniel McNally. The pair are campaigning for the East Lindsey District Council elections this Thursday.    A spokesman for the Scout Movement said: We can confirm that a complaint was made to Lincolnshire Scouts about the st Marshchapel Scout Group delivering information for a candidates in the upcoming local election. Following receipt of this complaint the local volunteer manager spoke with the Group Scout Leader of the Scout Group concerned and it was clear this was a genuine error on behalf of the Group and one they have apologised for. In accordance with Scouting’s rules the matter was reported to the Charity Commission by the local volunteer manager. “Subsequently the Group Scout Leader of the st Marshchapel Scout Group submitted his resignation after taking full responsibility for the incident. “Other volunteers have also since resigned. No volunteers have been asked to leave the Scout Movement because of this incident. The spokesman from Scout HQ said: Scouting is a non-political organisation. We canapost support any party. Delivering leaflets for a political party breaks our rules.   Scout leader, Matt Whall has posted a message on the village Facebook page apologising for the error.He said: I have stepped away from involvement with Marshchapel Scouts.Sadly, this is as a result of recent events in our community. “As you may be aware the Scouts recently distributed leaflets around the area. This was done in exchange for one year rent on an allotment space for the Scouts to grow veggies and learn about all things green, and not for financial gain for the group. “We hoped to run a soup kitchen for the community using veg grown in the village. The leaflets happened to be for a candidate in the local elections.    He added: ...The Scouts were  % safe at all times during this activity. I did not ask the Scouts to distribute leaflets for political gain or promotion but did something purely with the motive to provide an enriching opportunity for the Young People in the Group. It was an error on my part. As a consequence of this, coupled with a total lack of support for our Leaders from The Scout Association itself and their approach in dealing with the complaint, all the other Leaders have independently decided that they no longer wish to continue in their roles.” The councillors were approached for comment.

Sophie Hines, , Googled celebrities with large height dferences before she started dating Miles Lloyd, , to be reassured that they wouldnapost look ridiculous together. What is now a happy relationship could have actually started ten years previously when the then strangers posed together in a club because of their height dference, a recently emerged photo showed. One of the most common questions they get asked is how they have sex - a topic also on Sophieaposs mind when they first got together.    Despite the fact they have been mistaken for a dad and daughter, the lovebirds are happy with the ft in between them. Some online commentators are less content with the height dference however. Sophie has had angry taller girls rant at her online and say she should leave the tall boys alone and pick on someone her own size. Sophie and Miles, who share six-month-old son Remy Lloyd, admit it is a struggle when posing for selfies together and Miles often ends up with his head chopped out. Sophie, from Westclf-on-Sea, Essex, said: Our height dference hasnapost affected our relationship at all. I wouldnapost have him any other way.    I always say to him, aposdo you wish I was taller apos but he always says, aposno, I love it that youaposre smallapos. Iaposve never met any other couple with the same height dference as us. When we go out we get so many looks. It was weird at first but weaposve definitely embraced it now. Miles is so oblivious to it. When we first got together it was when Kourtney Kardashian was going out with Younes Bendjima and they had a massive height dference too.I was Googling pictures of Kourtney with her boyfriend and was worrying we would look ridiculous, so I had to Google to make sure I wasnapost the only one.I think people notice his height more because Iaposm so short. If I was  or something, I donapost think they would really notice it as much. But thereaposs such a contrast between us it makes it more noticeable.    Miles, who sometimes feels like a normal man in a tall manaposs body, enjoys the size contrast between their collection of size  and size  trainers. Miles, also from Westclf-on-Sea, Essex, said: I like our height dference. I love being out with her and showing off. We look very good together. We never spoke about the height dference when we started going out. I like that sheaposs small, I just like her. Itaposs amazing though. I canapost believe there are so many people interested in us. We just embrace it. I feel like Iaposm a normal man stuck in a tall manaposs body. I donapost even feel like Iaposm that tall - itaposs really surprising when people say it. I must get comments five or six times a day. I always ask them how tall they think I am because they always get it right first time anyway, so itaposs pointless, they didnapost need to ask.    The couple, who both work as underworkers in the same bank, had always noticed each other at the office but never spoke until Sophie joined Milesapos team. Sophie said: Iaposve known him since I was  - not to talk to, but Iaposve always seen him around. I saw him out loads of times and we worked in the same place for five years. Iaposve always known him as aposMiles the tall boyapos. We had never had a conversation but had seen each other around before we started going out. I remember just thinking how tall he was.

I think I just got the picture with him because he was so tall.    Itaposs so weird, and we look so dferent in the picture - and then  years later we have a baby together. Itaposs so strange. I donapost remember it. The dad-of-one claims he had always been shorter than his friends as a teenager, but suddenly shot up by six inches when he turned . Miles said: Thataposs the thing - all my friends were taller than me at one point. It was only when I turned  that I shot up. Iaposve not always been this big. I probably went from about  to about  or  in a year - I grew about six inches in a short space of time. My dad is  and my mum is  which is quite tall for a woman. Now weaposve got a little boy called Remy, and heaposs got massive hands and feet.    The couple claim they get a lot of questions about the logistics of their relationship and are even quizzed on their sex le. Sophie said it all works for us. Sophie, who is a mum-of-two, said: Loads of people ask us how we kiss. He has to crouch and I go on tiptoes - there is no other way. We get so many comments about how we have sex. I actually said that to him before we get together - how do you do it  But he said itaposs only his legs that are long - his body is a normal size. It all works for us, anyway. I just canapost believe that thataposs the first thing that people think of. I find it hard to frame a picture with both of us in. I normally just take selfies and things in the car because I know I can fit both of us in. Weaposve got a fullmirror in our house and Iaposve got loads where his head is just completely cut off. Itaposs him neck down, and thataposs it.    But despite being very happy together, Sophie claims she does get challenged by taller girls and has received negative comments online. Sophie said: A lot of angry tall girls have said I should leave the tall boys alone. There are a lot of angry tall girls who say, aposmy boyfriend is smaller than me, why have you taken a tall oneapos. But I canapost help it, can I  Itaposs such a silly comment.

The Government has praised a simple city-wide initiative that taught new parents how to be more strict. The city “saved” hundreds of four and five year olds from dangerous weight gain in just one year – and experts want the programme rolled out nationally. Seema Kennedy, public health minister, said: “While still in the early phases, it is encouraging to see what can be achieved locally.” Experts believe the reversal is due to sessions offering advice to new parents on beating pester power, such as setting proper meals times and reducing snacks. Almost one in  children are obese by primary school age. But academics from Israel analysed data in Leeds and found obesity in the Yorkshire city at the pre-school phase has gone into reverse.    Obesity expert Susan Jebb, of Oxford University, said: “It is quite astonishing. If you catch very young ­children parents have a heck of a lot of control over their lestyle.” Every health visitor, nursery nurse and ­children’s centre worker in the city has been trained in ­counselling devised by charity Health, Exercise, ­Nutrition for the Really Young. Two-month programmes were attended by , at-risk families since , at a cost of £ per family. Advice was also on offer through health visitors. Parents learn effective but simple strategies, such as not asking children what they want for a meal but asking them insteadthey want carrots or peas. Rates of obese children starting primary school fell from .% to .%. This compares to ­a stagnating rate in England, which was .% in  .    In one year analysed in the three-year study  preschool children avoided developing obesity during  . The training is available in  areas but not at the “unique scale” in Leeds. Kim Roberts, chief executive at HENRY, said of the figures: “This kind of reduction is unprecedented.” The team led by Bar Ilan University found poorer children in Leeds did the best with rates falling from .% to .%, compared to % across England.

Due to the aggressive nature of her disease, Esme simply does not have that long so they need to raise £, for a private transplant in weeks.    Esmeaposs dad said: “Having been told that a second transplant would be the fallback option for a failed first cord transplant, we have now learnt that the Marsden, to whom we have inexpressible gratitude for their expertise and care, are sadly blocked from supporting a second transplant until  months from the first due to NHS England policy. “Whilst we understand this policy from our extensive conversations with AML experts in the US, we know that for Esme the best course of action is try to get to a second transplant as soon as possible, rather than bide our time for seven months with maintenance chemotherapy to try and keep the disease at bay. “In the US and other private centres, second transplants are offered within one year but unfortunately that is not the case here in the UK. For her second transplant the plan would be to use an adultdonor and manipulate more aposgraft versus host effectapos to eradicate the leukaemia - so there is every hope for a permanent cure.You can donate to Esmeaposs cause here."},{"url":null,"title":"national lottery results live numbers","story":"NewsNational Lottery results LIVE: Numbers for Tuesdays £ million EuroMillions jackpotThe winning EuroMillions numbers for Tuesday April  have been drawnShareByBradley JollyUpdated:,  APR NewsThe National Lottery jackpot is a large one tonight \" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news national-lottery-results-live-numbers- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\"One lucky winner has tonight bagged the whopping £ million National Lottery jackpot.

One of the vehicles in Caracas is firing a water cannon at protesters who crowded around the vehicle and had been throwing stones at them. And at one point the vehicle accelerated, then shuddered to a quick stop, appearing to hit several people. Another armored vehicle appears to have ran directly over protesters at a dferent section of the roadway.Approximately  people are estimated to have been injured due to government aposrepression techniquesapos which includes the use of tear gas.   Earlier today Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido called for a military uprising to oust President Nicolas Maduro and armed factions exchanged gunfire outside a Caracas air base as the country hit a new crisis point after years of political and economic chaos. Since  Venezuela has suffered one of the worst economic crisis in their history - which is also among the worst in the world.It started in  when then-president Hugo Chavez declared an aposeconomic warapos because of food shortages. The country has been hit by chronic shortages of food and medicine, blackouts and a UN report estimated in March  that % of Venezuelans live in poverty. Guaido urged protesters and members of the military to join what he called the aposfinal phase of Operation Libertyapos in a video taken at La Carlota airbase in the capital Caracas. The troops then set up defensive positions around the base before Maduroaposs forces arrived and opened fire with teargas followed by live rounds, according to witnesses. Today the defence minister said that armed forces remain loyal to the constitution and that the aposact of violence was partly defeatedapos.  The Venezuelan ambassador in Madrid, Mario Isea, said a a reported coup attempt against the government had failed and claimed that all military bases are loyal to the Government. Venezuelaaposs Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza denied there was ever a military coup underway to oust President Nicolas Maduro and accused Juan Guaido of operating under orders from Washington. It is not a coup attempt from the military. This is directly planned in Washington, in the Pentagon and Departmentof State, and byBolton, Arreaza told Reuters in a phone interview.  They are leading this coup and giving orders to this manGuaido, he said, adding that Maduro was still in full control of the country with the backing of the military. Juan Guaido is recognized by Brazil, the United States and dozens of other Western nations as the countryaposs interim leader. While Brazil has recognized Guaido as the interim leader of Venezuela, it has opposed military intervention there to overthrow Maduroaposs socialist government.

Aberdeen injury list continues to grow, Scott McKenna insists the Dons won’t buckle in the race for Europe.More and more key players are on the sidelines, but the the centre-back says the Reds still have enough within the ranks to clinch a sixth successive Europa League qualication.Sunday’s - defeat to Rangers at Ibrox means Derek McInnes’ side are now in a battle for third spot – which would guarantee European football for next term.Home games against Celtic and Hearts, followed by a trip to Easter Road to face Hibs, are still ahead for Aberdeen as the Pittodrie squad becomes increasingly stretched.Niall McGinnand Tommie Hobanare out for the rest of the season, while Graeme Shinnie, Gary Mackay-Stevenand Connor McLennanare in a race against time to feature again this term.Shay Loganhas been out since early February, but is closing in on a .However, McKenna insists the injury problems can’t be used as an excuse by the Dons.The -year-old Scotland international said: “It is disappointing to have players out – but it was almost the same team that was good enough to win at Kilmarnock.“We had Shinnie out but Lewis Ferguson came back in . Although to lose Connor so early was a blow for us in the game.“We are starting to get down to the bare bones of the squad – but we have been here before and coped with it and we’ll do the same again this time.“We have a big enough squad and enough good young players to come in and fill the places of the players that are absent.“We are still chasing that European spot of third and that task continues against Celtic on Saturday.“Last season it went to the final game and we won against Celtic to finish second.“This year will be the same – we just need to take care of the next three games and hopefully that will get us third spot.”Although the Dons’ squad is down to the bare bones, they are still three points clear of fourth-placed Kilmarnock.McKenna believes the experience gained at the end of last season, when Aberdeen won at Parkhead on the last day of the season, can stand them in good stead this term as they again look to secure Europe.He added: “The experience of last season can help because in last season’s run-in we were very strong.“We need to be much the same again this year. Last season we didn’t lose after the split.“Unfortunately this year we have lost after the split so it means we need to win an extra game.“We’ve beaten Hibs and Hearts at home this season and we’ve run Celtic close getting beat - at home.“At Parkhead we’ve been narrowly beaten - and drawn -, but we’ll look to change that in the next game. ”McKenna was disappointed to lose to Rangers on Sunday. Although the Gers did control proceedings, the stopper was frustrated by the goals Aberdeen conceded.Both were penalties from James Tavernier, but McKenna felt they were both soft awards by referee Don Robertson.The first was when Nikola Katic hit the deck after a tangle of legs with Lewis Ferguson, and for the second the same player went down holding his face when jumping with Andy Considine at a corner, with the Dons defender receiving a second yellow card following the incident.McKenna said: “It was obviously a very disappointing result for us.“We went to Ibrox with the intention of getting three points and we’re leaving with nothing.“They had a lot of possession as they usually do in games at Ibrox. But we have managed to deal with that in previous games.“On Sunday, Joe Lewis pulled off a couple of unbelievable saves to keep us at - at half-time.“Then to come out at the start of the second half and concede a goal so early was tough because it looked like a soft penalty. I thought Fergie was maybe pushed a bit and then Katic just throws himself to the ground.“And with the second one I turned round and saw Andy had his hands up and Katic has his hands up.“Then Katic throws himself to the ground again and wins the penalty.“I felt it was another soft decision, but they didn’t go for us.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.41705799-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.41705799-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.41705799-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/05/2.41705799-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeens union terrace gardens revamp start in summer","story":"Work to transform Aberdeen#s Union Terrace Gardens will start this summer after a contractor was appointed.Balfour Beatty has been chosen to carry out the £. million works on the historic gardens.The plan will see the space transformed into an #inclusive st Century space# while #enhancing UTG#s heritage features#.LDA design, the firm behind London’s Olympic Park, unveiled their designs for the park in .The flagship project was originally due to be completed by July but had been knocked back until .The transformation of the park includes creating shop and cafe spaces in the arches, and installing water features and community gardens, with work expected to take between  and  months to complete.Council co-Leader Councillor Douglas Lumsden said: “With the selection of Balfour Beatty as contractor, the job of turning the vision for Union Terrace Gardens into reality is about to start in earnest.“This is a moment for celebration right across Aberdeen.“The investment we’re making is transforming our city and the benefits will be felt throughout the region. Generations to come can share in the rewards.”Hector MacAulay, Balfour Beatty’s regional managing director of Scotland and Ireland, said: “We are looking forward to working with Aberdeen City Council to transform the historic Union Terrace Gardens, which on completion will signicantly contribute to the Council’s City Centre Masterplan.“Our construction expertise coupled with our experience in regenerating public spaces makes us ideally positioned to deliver the three new pavilions and sympathetically upgrade this much-loved historic space which will benefit the local community and visitors alike for years to come.”SNP Group Leader, Councillor Stephen Flynn said: “I am sure the people of Aberdeen will be at a total loss as to how the administration can justy spending almost £ million on Union Terrace Gardens when they are continuing to make severe cuts to services across the city.“Project costs have soared by at least £ million since  and it is now certain that the gardens will be delivered two years late – what a complete shambles.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cc2fdb94c6587.05276450.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet strider tara and bond are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This handsome pup is one year old and has been neutered.Strider is a friendly boy with lots of love to give the right family.He will need a new owner who has the time to continue his training as he is strong and has not been good with other dogs while in the kennels.He is not suitable to be homed around cats or young children due to his boisterous nature.Can you offer Strider his forever home Tara is five years old and has been neutered.This lovely girl is a larger dog who will need a home with access to lots of space for her to run around in and a secure garden as she can jump quite high.She needs a home with no other pets but is used to children over  years old.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14580367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_180419rugby_02JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club prepare murrayfield","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club prepare for Murrayfield date with destiny against HeriotsThe club will bid to land a fourth Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double this season when they head for the capital on Saturday.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsAyr Rugby coach Peter Murchie and his players \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Make mine a double, writes Ron Evans.That was the cry at Millbrae when the pink and black faithful realised that their team had created the chance to win the Tennent’s Premiership and the Scottish Cup in what will be the last opportunity to achieve this feat under the current league set-up. Ayr have been there before of course in  when they won the Premiership by defeating Currie then the Cup final against Melrose with the unforgettable Cammy Taylor try in the injury time of extra time. This time, however, they take on Heriot’s in both games. Having won the epic Tennent’s Premiership play-off final against the Goldenacre outfit two weeks ago, the Nailsare again Ayr’s opponents on Saturday in the cup final at Murrayfield. It might be inappropriateto suggest that Ayr are going out to hammer the Nails on Saturday, but that is exactly what they plan to do. Now in possession of more senior cup and league medals than any other Scottish player, veteran full back Grant Anderson told some of the rookies for whom this is a first- time experience: “You think beating Heriots at Millbrae was good  “Doing it at Murrayfield will feel a hundred times better!” Skipper Pete McCallum, heading for his third cup final at Murrayfield with a won one lost one record, certainly agreed that it was great chance for the players to express themselves on the big stage. “Playing on the international pitch is always something really special so we want to enjoy the occasion and go out with a bang,” he said.  As was the case at Millbrae, there will be little to choose between the two sides, their regular league form having panned out with an away win each but in the winner-takes- all contest for the Premiership title showdown, Ayr were superior. “Yes, we are in a good place but there will be no complacency” said coach Peter Murchie. “It was a physical game and we would expect the same in the cup final. “Thankfully we didn’t pick up any injuries and we were able to give the squad a bit of a rest after the last game which has let us build gradually towards Murrayfield.” “The squad are totally motivated as you would expect from any team going into a cup final becauseyou can’t be motivated for that then I donapost know what would get you up for a game. “I have said several times to the squad that opportunities like this don’t come along very often in your career and you have to take those opportunities and make the very best of it. “Some of our squad have experienced this situation before and our senior players will be a big part of what we achieve but we have some really exciting young talent as well so we will give it our best shot and hopefully have a great finish to what has already been a memorable season.” It has indeed been memorable andAyr do add a fourth Scottish Cup success to the Tennent’s Premiership title, then the call will likely be for trebles not doubles all round.

The cash withdrawals took place between July  and May  and Cowan helped herself to more than £, of the patient’s savings. The Scottish Social Services Councilheard how the offence came to light when the victim, known only as ‘AA’ and requiring “multiple care needs” decided to alert care home staff, believing that the money would never be repaid.When shocked senior staff at Glebe House found out about the incidents they called the police and reported the matter to the Care Inspectorate and the SSSC. But in the subsequent investigation, Cowan was understood to have shown “limited insight and remorse” in respect of her actions. The victim gave evidence during the hearing, telling the SSSC’s Fitness to Practise Panel how, during a conversation with Cowan, she told her she was “worried about money.” The victim initially offered Cowan money but that invitation was declined. However, in a later conversation, around a week later, Cowan, who had no previous record of wrong-doing with the SSSC, indicated that she “needed a certain amount of money.” On this occasion Cowan was given the lady’s bank card and PIN and the service user believed £ would be withdrawn. In the weeks and months thereafter, a similar scenario took place “several times.” Several cash withdrawals took place from the ATM at the Co-operative, Dalmellington. Cowan then came up with a “sob story” about a family member’s Christmas present and again, the patient handed over her bank card. This pattern continued and the patient did not report the matter at that point because Cowan “promised to pay it back” and she “believed her.” However, the victim’s concerns grew and she reported the matter to other members of staff after fearing she wasn’t going to get her money back. Another witness claimed she was “shocked” that a carer had taken a resident’s bank card and withdrawn money for her own use. During the investigation process Cowan started to make repayments of the outstanding amount. At the hearing in Dundee the victim was described as a “lonely and vulnerable inidual” but “very switched on” and an “impressive witness” who gave her evidence in a forthright manner and was found to be both “credible” and “reliable.” In their written judgement the SSSC found Cowan’s conduct fell “far below the standards” expected, labelled her actions were “serious and deliberate” and amounted to a “signicant breach of trust.” The Panel also stated they could not be satisfied that Cowan had “acknowledged the gravity” of her conduct, or that she demonstrated “meaningful regret.” The judgement concluded: “A Removal Order is the only sanction that will provide an adequate safeguard against yourepeating your misconduct. “It is the only sanction that will ensure that service users are not placed at risk of harm and will maintain public confidence in social services and the SSSC as regulator.” Cowan was neither present nor represented at the hearing. A spokesperson for East Ayrshire Council said: “We are aware of the situation and understand that care home management acted appropriately in conjunction with Scottish Social Service Council and Care Inspectorate when they learned about allegations against the member of staff. “Through our contract management arrangements we actively engage with all the care homes in East Ayrshire to provide assurance in respect of the quality of service provided to residents.” The Post did contact Glebe House Care Home for a response but did not receive one.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrEast Ayrshire CouncilSocial servicesDundee"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14904281.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18944840.jpg","title":"ayr united startlet tipped make","story":"NewsAyr United startlet tipped to make big time -he avoids video game FortniteLuke McCowan won praise from boss Ian McCall after a brilliant debut in Ayrs - win at Firhill on Saturday.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsMcCowan is being tipped for big things\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIan McCall has tipped Ayr Unitedaposs newest star to make a name for himself - as long as he stays off computer games.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily

This mast should provide an lsquoemergency servicersquo for all the local residents and businesses should our land lines fail, as they frequently do.ldquoThere have been many occasions when accidents have happened with no means of getting help.ldquoThis will also be a great asset to tourists and traffic passing through our valley.The local branch of the National Farmers Union, which counts  members, has also thrown its weight behind the proposals.In a support letter, Selkirk branch secretary Rory Murray writes: ldquoIt is vital that in todayrsquos connected world, basic services now include the provision of a reliable mobile network, and not just for the obvious benefits to rural safety, should people be stranded without signal.ldquoA solid G signal will transform many agricultural-based businessrsquo ability to complete basic tasks that are now exclusively online, as the time constraints poor mobile phone signal and broadband signal places on rural businesses is a very real worry for our members.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council has received nine letters of objection to the plans, with objectors citing the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.Mr Brian Russell, of Selkirk, writes in his objection letter: ldquoThat the Ettrick valley must have mobile masts is disappointing to those of us who came here to escape such things.ldquoOf course escape is now becoming impossible anywhere on this island, but at the very least we had hoped to be allowed to live far enough away from a base station not to be adversely affected.ldquoHealth concerns for masts and cell phones are largely discounted now, but itrsquos as well to remember that the questionable safety of very profitable technologies may not come out for decades after their introduction, e.g. in the s and s there was widespread use of agrochemicals. I was a farmer at that time and was told they were perfectly safe. Many of the chemicals we were using then have now been banned as unsafe for one reason or another.ldquoI fear the same sort of thing will happen with mobile technologies, the overuse of which masts like this one will encourage ndash technologies which are described as essential but are more often than not simply recreational or convenient.In a submission to council planners, the developers have tried to address some of the issues raised by the objectors.Damian Hosker, the principal planner at WHP Telecoms, writes: ldquoG connectivity enables iniduals and businesses to work and ecommerce effectively from home.ldquoThis means that car travel can be reduced which has a positive effect on the environment.ldquoMobile connectivity creates a sustainable community and promotes environmental issues.ldquoThe proposal is set against the backdrop of the forest. The screening could not be more prominent. WHP will, however, paint the installation green or brown or whatever colour the local planning authority wishes to see.ldquoThe value of property is not a planning issue, however, in an age where connectivity is ever more important for e-commerce, including: real-time tax s education health services requirement to attract tourists social wellbeing and emergencies there is expected to be a positive value to property as a result of being connected.ldquoNo connectivity in the UK is not acceptable to purchasers in the st century.As a result of the number of objections received, the application will be decided by councillors sitting on the Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee.The committee is due to meet on Monday, April  to deliberate on the proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"community-group-targets-steading-to-ease-ettrick-housing-demand","story":"PLANS are in place for a community development company to buy a redundant steading in the Ettrick Valley to ease housing pressures.With many farm and estate cottages being sold over the past decade or so, affordable rentable accommodation in the rural valleys south of Selkirk has dwindled.The Ettrick and Yarrow Community Development Companyhope to reverse the trend by buying Kirkhope Steading, outside of Ettrickbridge, and convert the buildings into inexpensive homes to rent.EYCDC have also launched a housing survey to identy the demand for affordable housing in the area.The group have commissioned Rural Housing Scotland to independently run the survey to gauge opinion on affordable rent, buying prices, size and type of home required.A paper copy of the survey, along with a reply paid envelope, can be found in the Post Office in Selkirk, Honey Cottage Caravan Park shop in Ettrick, the Cross Keys pub in Ettrickbridge and from the Gordon Arms in Yarrow.The survey form can also be filled in online at https:www.surveymonkey r TNDLDIn , a full survey was carried out which highlighted a need for more affordable housing in the Ettrick and Yarrow Valleys.And it is thought the need has increased signicantly during the past  years.Project Manager of EYCDC, Vicky Davidson said: ldquoWe are concerned that the lack of affordable housing is impacting on the number of children living in the valleys, with fewer families and young people able to find somewhere to live.\"We are urging anyone who might be interested in living in the valleys but do not think they are able to find a suitable house, at an affordable rent, to complete the housing survey as soon as possible.\"And to pass on the survey link to anyone who might like toto live there now or within the next couple of yearsthere was an affordable option available.\"The EYCDCs plans for Kirkhope Steading include some workspace areas and potential office units as well as rentable housing.Funding has been provided by the Scottish Land Fund to carry out an independent valuation, get a structural engineers report and to prepare some architect options for the site.This work is now complete and it was presented to a public meeting in Ettrickbridge on April .The proposal is to start work on the site in the beginning of  and be at completion during spring the following year.For more information contact info@ettrickandyarrow.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"council-to-chip-in-extra-42k-for-hawick-regeneration-scheme","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has agreed to chip in an extra pound, for a Hawick regeneration scheme, in order to receive a million pound grant from Scottish ministers.The local authority has already been awarded pound.m from Historic Environment Scotland to fund the Hawick Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme .However, the council intended to provide just pound, to the pot, to acquire a pound.m grant, but instead has had to stump up an extra pound, in order to secure pound.m.Along with private sector contributions of pound,, the project will have a budget of pound.m to go towards restoring shop fronts and historic buildings in the town centre.At a meeting of Scottish Borders Council executive committee on Tuesday, April , councillors waved through the extra money and emphasised the positives the CARS scheme will bring to Hawick.Hawick and Hermitage councillor George Turnbull told the meeting: ldquoThis is a great news item for Hawick and will help with the town centre regeneration.ldquoIrsquod just like to publicly record my thanks to the team which has put in so much work to achieve this, I wish the project well and every success over the next five years.Kelso and District councillor Tom Weatherston, who has experienced the CARS scheme in Kelso, added: ldquoI welcome this as great news for Hawick.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

those in need.Dominic Taddei, who grew up in Hawick and spent almost five years serving his country with the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, decided to leave the Borders behind in .He sold off many of his possessions to fund a two-year volunteering mission across Africa and has ed with a renewed sense of perspective.During his travels across Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda Dominic witnessed violent election riots, contracted Malaria and suffered a iety of broken bones having fallen down a storm drain.Dominic, who is , told the Border : ldquoWe really donrsquot have any idea of how others live on the other side of the world in some of the poorest countries on earth.ldquoI spent most of my time living in slums, which ied from corrugated houses to mud houses with grass thatched roofs.During his time in Africa, Dominic acted as a trustee for Roll Out the Barrel Trust UK, a project that aims to help with water supply issues in some of the worldrsquos poorest countries.Dominic also helped found a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a cafeacute selling food to the public.Dominic fully embraced the lestyle of the local community, enduring the same daily struggles faced by the local population.ldquoI experienced what it was like to have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude to le since ing to the UK in March.He added: ldquoAfter selling most of my things to help fund this mission I now own very few items and the ones I do own I appreciate more.ldquoI appreciate things like electricity, running water, showers and fridges.ldquoI now live a fairly simple le and, to be honest, I feel happier doing

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

while denying millions of people free withdrawals.ldquoA regulator is desperately needed to get a grip of these rapid changes across the cash landscape and ensure all those still reliant on this

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

Papers related to its commission and invoices confirmed it had been installed in  ndash the same year the revolutionary turbine was designed by Eric Crewdson, who had outlined its features while serving in the trenches of the war.Crewdson conceived the idea of a side-entry impulse turbine capable of running at twice the speed of a Pelton water-wheel turbine, with a higher efficiency across a broad flow range.Within months of ing from the war, his concept had been developed and the first Turgo turbine installed at a property in Crieff.However, it is no longer operational ndash making the Stewartsrsquo refurbished and repainted turbine the oldest operational example version of its type in Scotland.The refurbishment was carried out by the original manufacturers, while Mr Stewart set about removing a build-up of silt from the burn.He added: ldquoThe turbinersquos governor alone, which controls the flow of water and is a beautul piece of engineering, must have weighed half a tonne ndash the new one only weighs around half a pound.

Whorsquod blame them  The SNP is a political party which wants to win office. It had to keep throwing red meat to the base with cries of ldquoindy is coming, while trying to maintain electoral appeal beyond independence voters.There are five key issues the Yes movement must look to ithopes to win independence well. The first is the tone of debate. Before the last referendum, many voters inherently distrustful of nationalism were brought over to Yes because it seemed open and embracing, it offered an alternative to failed Westminster. Progressives and centrists, and even some on the right, found a comfortable home as Yes voters. There was still a brittle, nasty online presence but it seemed of little intellectual importance.However, today, it appears asthis shrill minority is the dominant voice. The table seating needs readjustingtherersquos to be success. Put these petulant ldquoshouty people at the back of the room.This isnrsquot about silencing voices, they are free to say what they please, but those in leadership positions must speak up against this fringe which repels those considering a Yes vote. Stop following these people on social media, stop amplying their nasty messages ndash especiallyyoursquore in elected office.Which takes us to our second point ndash outreach. The Yes movement must once again start chasing voters and not talking to itself. Woo undecideds. Woo Unionists. Woo everyone. Self-congratulatory backslapping does nothing. Waving a Saltire in the face of Unionists wonrsquot win votes. Marching around a town wonrsquot change anyonersquos mind.Itrsquos not just that many in the base of whatrsquos left of the Yes movement arenrsquot attracting enough new voters to their side, some are wilfully deterring newcomers. The use of the derogatory term ldquoYoonto describe Unionists is guaranteed to offend and repel. Do some really believe insulting people and laughing at them will convert anyone  If MI wanted to cook up an intelligence operation to undermine Scottish independence they could do no better than many of the biggest online voices who claim to back Yes.A banner was unveiled outside the SNP conference at the weekend saying ldquoEngland get out of Scotland.

Also at the SNP conference was Dave Thompson, former SNP MSP and chair of Voices for Scotland which is meant to be an ldquoinclusive\" Yes campaign group. Mr Thompson used Gaelic and Scots to introduce himself to delegates and added: ldquoApologies to those who do not have the two proper languages of Scotland. Really  It may have been a joke, but is this what we want to hear from a party which says it welcomes EU residents Thirdly, the Yes movement needs to get real over dficult questions. Voters have been exhausted and terried by Brexit. The SNP grassroots may want to scrap the pound, but itrsquos not a policy thatrsquos going to win new Yes voters ndash it will only scare them. When it comes to independence, undecideds are now worried about trade deals with England and a possible hard border. Brexit has made independence more dficult as itrsquos raised more questions.No-one sane wants independence to pile on more ision after Brexit. Thatrsquos why the creation of Citizensrsquo Assemblies, to work out the future of Scotland, is a welcome move. Take these big frightening questions directly to the people and to experts and letrsquos hear the evidence and the truth. Momentous change needs rigorous analysis and adult honesty.Fourthly, independence is too big for the SNP alone ndash Scotland is not the SNPrsquos country, it is the peoplersquos, and Citizensrsquo Assemblies can help us work out what is in all our best interests when it comes to our constitutional future, rather than in the narrow interests of one party. It must be said over and over again that a Yes vote is not an SNP vote.I want to see Scotland independent but I want to know the full hard truths before I vote again ndash and I fervently do not want to see this country ided against itself.Perhaps, then, the fth issue is the hardest for many Yes voters to accept ndash that a mere win in any second referendum is not enough, maybe we need to set ourselves a  per cent margin before enacting change. It would be bold, it would ease fears among Unionists, it would show that the Yes movement cares about the country, not just itself, and many may find that appealing and attractive.Most importantly, do we want Scotland in the wake of a close win for independence ndash like a - margin ndash to go through the pain and hatred Britain has already gone through with Brexit  I want independence ndash but I do not want that.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-stevie-chalmers-flight-fright","story":"FURTHER cruel news with the death of Stevie Chalmers so soon after that of Billy McNeill.

Having once boasted an extensive tram system that connected all corners of the city and beyond to its bustling centre, it now relies on the only subway in the world never to have been extended, a bus network so inadequate that a quarter of its inhabitants must take at least two buses to get to work, and a rail network that, despite being the UKrsquos best outside London, remains disjointed and struggles on a daily basis to keep up with demand.Sure, several subway stations have been scrubbed up in recent years and the pound million revamp of Queen Street Station will bring a long-overdue injection of modernity to one of the cityrsquos main transport hubs, but itrsquos hardly the stuff of a thriving metropolis with pretensions of becoming a major player on the European scene. Plans unveiled by the Glasgow Connectivity Commission, a body founded two years ago by council leader Susan Aitken and chaired by transport expert Professor David Begg, could change all that, bringing benefits not just to the city but its inhabitants too.In a report published this week, the commission has unveiled bold plans for transforming Glasgow into an ldquoinclusive, thriving, liveable city within the next  years by, among other things, enclosing the section of the M that cuts a polluting tract through the city and creating a cycle-route network that connects the economic centre to the suburbs and surrounding areas that feed it. It is the proposal for a Glasgowthat could make the biggest dference overall, though, by bringing parts of the city that were cut off when the tram system was abandoned and rail network rationalised out of their imposed isolation.The plans for Glasgow itself would see abandoned rail routes such as the one that connected Maryhill to the West End via a stop at the Botanic Gardens reinstated, while a new line would create a much-needed link between Renfrew, Braehead, the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and the city centre. A tunnel under the Clyde, meanwhile, would link the services operating out of Queen Street and Central stations to create a joined-up service stretching across the whole of the Central Belt while an extension to Glasgow Central would pave the way for the kind of high-speed services that would make it possible to travel between Glasgow and London in three hours or less.The plan for Glasgow Airport, which revives the idea of a rail link to Paisley Gilmour Street for a connection to Glasgow rather than one straight to the city centre itself, remains highly unsatisfactory for a city that craves a role on the global stage. Anyone who has made the frustratingly fractured journey from Luton Airport to Luton Airport Parkway then onto the centre of London could tell you that a city that has secured signicant job-creating investments from employers like Barclays but will always compete with the likes of Manchester and Birmingham for further deals should know it too. But with the report noting that connectivity ldquois the leblood of any socio-economic system and that transport networks ldquoinfluence a cityrsquos quality of le, shape its urban fabric and determine the type of economic activity it supports, the bulk of its recommendations are exciting.Too much of Glasgow and its surrounding areas remain cut off from the parts of the city where jobs are created and sustained, with the two-thirds of the population who live near a train station or own a car most likely to benefit from those evolving opportunities while the third that do not remain left behind. Indeed, it should come as no surprise that the report found the most deprived areas of the city are poorly served by the rail network while the richest parts are not. A new train line will never solve the multi-layered social problems our most abandoned communities have been left to deal with, particularly as some of those problems pre-date the advent of the connectivity our most advantaged ones enjoy. It can provide an opportunity to help narrow the worst socio-economic gaps, though.One of the biggest barriers to such potentially transformational projects will always be the cost and the Glasgow Connectivity Commission reckons it will take pound billion over  years to make its vision a reality. In a pothole-ridden city that canrsquot even keep its streets clean today that is going to be one hell of an ask. And, with major projects such as the Queensferry Crossing, Edinburgh tram line and Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route already demonstrating how hard ambitious budgets and timetables can be to stick to, a project that would dwarf all of them in terms of scope and scale will remain a daunting one.Yet with the project promising to enhance Glasgowrsquos economic fortunes to the benefit of all its citizens, it must be a price worth paying. As Professor Begg said, ldquowe need to raise Glasgowrsquos levels of ambitionsuch a transformation is to be achieved.Dare we be so bold  We canrsquot afford not to be.Read more: Plans for a Glasgownetwork and Central-Queen Street tunnel unveiled"},{"url":null,"title":"israeli-firm-bids-to-buy-2bn-north-sea-oil-and-gas-portfolio","story":"Reuters reported that Delek had confirmed in a regulatory filing in Tel Aviv that it was in talks to buy Chevronrsquos oil and gas fields in the UK North Sea as part of its international expansion plans.Delek did not provide financial details in the filing but said a deal could be completed this year.The company has already shown it is willing to invest big sums in the North Sea.

Also it produced a result which waslarge enough to be indisputable.The same cannot be said of the  referendum. We now know that the Leave campaign was based on a construction of lies, financial misconduct and funding from some very obscure sources.My first thought on reading Mr Hoskinss letter was that any politician who, in the face of the evidence, thinks that referendums are a suitable way to decide anything probably needs their bumps read, but no. The trick is to make sure that they are properly conducted, that the playing field is leveland that funding and its sources are absolutely transparent.There would of course still be opportunities to mislead, as for example Gordon Brown and his friends with their late and deceiving interventions, but voters will be prepared for that next time.The answer is not two-legged referendums, but a single honestly-conducted one.John Jamieson, Craigie Road,Ayr.I wonder how much that will cost our finite public purse and hard-pressed businesses, not to mention the prospect of additional bureaucratic expenses when a borderis established between Scotland and the rest of the UK.Iris Clyde,Voresheed, Kirkwall, Orkney.Read more: Sturgeon warns party must convince voters Scottish independence will not damage economyRUTH Davidson says she has \"plenty to aim at\" in her conference speech this upcoming weekend .

It recommended the introduction of six tests to guide that transition, one of which is the financial requirements of Scottish residents and businesses.ldquoThose tests were back by SNP conference on Saturday. Our position is clear. Until a new currency can be safely and established in the interests of the whole economy, the currency of an independent Scotland should continue to be the pound sterling.Mr Kelly said the SNP wanted to drop the pound immediately, devaluing savings, and would make Scottish families and business ldquosignicantly worse off.Mr Mackay, who was on the Growth Commission, said he was ldquodelighted the currency resolution he co-authored was passed - after activists added ldquoas soon as practicable.He said: ldquoWe have set out, in terms of currency, the position that we continue with the pound.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline. Additional non-recyclable waste bins may also be authorised where there is a genuine need following a home visit and assessment by a Community Waste Officer. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Police urge revellers to be safe and responsible viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"The council’s Head of Roads, Waste and Landscape services, Philip McKay, said: “It’s important residents understand how to recycle properly and make best use of the facilities available to them. “Sending waste to landfill costs more than double the amount it costs to recycle and tackling the levels of contamination in kerbside bins is intended to reduce the amount of recyclates sent to landfill.“We will be enforcing the procedures in a staggered rollout, tackling problem routes first. This will allow crews to get used to the new procedures without any severe implications for the collection schedule.”Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services.Residents are encouraged to get in touch with the Recycling and Waste Aberdeenshire Facebook pagethey are unsure of how to dispose of any material not listed in the A-Z guide.For any recycling and waste related queries, or to request an additional recycling or non-recycling bin, please contact Wasteline."},{"url":null,"title":"occasional hours licence for brewdog","story":"An Aberdeenshire licensing authority has narrowly paved the way for the anticipated opening of BrewDog#s new #, Inverurie bar and restaurant next month.Despite the brewing giants not possessing a provisional licence, Aberdeenshire Central Licensing Board took the highly unusual step of granting two occasional licences to enable it to open in the former Mitchell’s Dairy premises on Market Street.Some  new staff can now be employed at the bar which will see the number of BrewDog employees in Aberdeenshire soar to more than .BrewDog retail director James Brown told the board the firm had made “a huge commitment to Inverurie and Aberdeenshire” and afterwards said he was “delighted” with the decision which will initially allow the bar to operate from May  to .The company’s full licence application is currently being fast-tracked by the council after delays incurred due to the installation of a new data system and subsequent backlog.Under the agreement after a close - vote by licensing board members, the bar has been limited to operating from am to  midnight Sunday to Thursday and from am to am Friday and Saturday but only while former BrewDog Tap Room manager Craig Cargill is on the premises. Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"thainstone prepares for annual show and sale","story":"Aberdeen and Northern Marts# Thainstone Centre is gearing up for its annual show and sale of commercial breeding cattle and pedigree bulls and females next week.The show and sale of heers with calves at foot and other commercial breeding cattle, sponsored by East Coast Viners, will commence on Tuesday, April  with the show in Ring  at am, followed by the sale at am.Judges for the pre-sale show are Will MacDonald, Tormore and Kris Sutherland, Dunbeath Farms.Included in the offering of  breeding cattle is top-quality Simmental cross, Limousin cross and Salers cross heers, with spring-born calves at foot, many with show ring potential.All heers have been selected for their milking and breeding ability.On the same day, the annual show and sale of pedigree bulls and females, sponsored by Ardene Vets, has attracted  bulls and three females.Orkney’s Liam Muir from Upper Onston, will judge the pedigree bulls from am onwards in the Exchange and the sale will commence at .pm in Ring .Forward for sale is  Charolais, nine Limousin, eight Simmental, seven Salers, five Aberdeen-Angus, two British Blue, two Beef Shorthorn and  Gascone.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Vandals strike at Inverurie school viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"vandals strike at inverurie school","story":"Police Scotland is appealing for witnesses after trees were vandalised at an Inverurie school.A number of trees were damaged at Strathburn Primary School on two separate occasions between Thursday  and Monday  April.PC James Stewart said: \"The trees had been planted by pupils at the school and have been damaged beyond repair.\"This act of vandalism is completely mindless and is not only extremely upsetting for the school community but will be costly to remedy.\"Anyone with information is asked to contact police on  using ref. no.

Also among those present was Janine Miller, we of Australian national Greg Miller who also lives in Orkney.This year the wreath was laid on the final resting place of –year–old Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve pilot, LieutenantThomas Noel Bush, who was tragically killed on December , .Lt Bush’s Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter plunged from the sky above Kirkwall straight into the Peedie Sea — while, only yards away, people were in their homes, or going about their daily business.On that fateful day, Lt Bush arrived to pick up the aircraft and, following a few pre-flight checks, took to the air.However, within minutes witnesses heard the aircraft`s engine revving at high speed and, from a height of approximately ft, it ed straight down into the Peedie Sea, killing the pilot instantly.Local emergency services and personnel from HMS Sparrowhawk were quickly on the scene, but nothing could be done for the unfortunate pilot.Lt Bush’s body was recovered from the wreckage and he was buried, with full military honours, in St Olaf`s Cemetery, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, on December , .Kirkwall branch of the Royal British Legion chairman Dougie Manson said: “Those who died came from far and wide to serve their countries overseas, coming here today is the least we can do to remember them.

But, given the damage, it’s going to take some time before the walkway is operational again.“Until we know the full extent of the work required, it’s dficult to say with certainty how long it will be out of action, but it could be a number of months.“We realise this will cause inconvenience for passengers and for NorthLink Ferries. We’ve kept the ferry company up to date and this will continue as the work progresses.“We won’t know the cost of the repair work until the full assessment is completed, but it could be substantial.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With new surfacing laid over the last week, the council say that a short time will be required for the surface to cure, with the streets to reopen to traffic on Friday at the latest.The works are part of the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative’sPlaces and Spaces project, which include changes to the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, as well as providing a new path to the War Memorial on the Kirk Green.With the initial phase of the project now completed, works will be suspended for the main summer season. Plans are for work to move to the entrance to Victoria Street in the autumn, being suspended again in December for Christmas shopping season.The Places and Spaces initiative was developed alongside community groups such as the Kirkwall and St Ola Community Council and the Kirkwall BID, who identied key areas of the town where it was felt improvements could be made. According to OIC, proposed improvements were the positively received by the Orkney community during a two-day consultation period, where  per cent of those who attended said they supported the proposals,  per cent were against and the rest were undecided.The Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative is a five-year heritage-based grant scheme which seeks to deliver sustainable improvements to the built heritage of the Kirkwall Conservation Area, in an effort to regenerate the centre of Kirkwall for the benefit of local communities and businesses, as well as to attract visitors. The scheme has been running since July  and will conclude in June.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Ethical beverage supplier Ethyco now supplies  per cent compostable single-use cups and lids across NorthLink Ferries’ food and drink outlets.Ceramic catering pots have also replaced plastic pots and reusable polycarbonate beakers have replaced wax-lined disposable drinking cups. The replacement beakers have led to approximately , disposable cups and , plastic lids being removed from the waste stream per annum.More than , polystyrene food trays used in children#s meal packages have been replaced by a plant-based and  per cent compostable alternative.Seumas Campbell, Serco’s customer service director for NorthLink Ferries, said: “Looking after the natural environment is such an important part of the service we provide. So we are passionate about minimising our impact on the world around us. The steps we have taken to remove single-use plastics are very positive and we will keep looking for more opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint.”One Stop Waste Solutions, an Aberdeen-based recycling and waste services company, has seconded that NorthLink Ferries has already met the criteria for the  ban on general commercial waste sent to landfill.Craig Donoghue, managing director of the organisation added: “We have been working closely with NorthLink Ferries since , and in that time have seen a sustained effort to recycle and reduce waste. In particular, this commitment has peaked since  coinciding with ‘the Attenborough effect’.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A spokeswoman for Cardtronics said: ldquoWe have been forced into charging a fee for cash withdrawals on some ofour machines where Linkrsquos cuts have left us with no choice.ldquoThe decision on whether to introduce a fee is taken on a case-by-case basis and reflects the economic viability of the inidual machine.ldquoWe only ever charge a fee when there is no other option apart from removing the machine altogether.Meanwhile, Peter McNamara, chief executive of cashpoint provider NoteMachine, said: ldquoThe whole Link system is now under severe threat from a toxic combination of wholesale bank branch closures, the unavoidable sht of many free-to-use machines to a charging model, and the mothballing of low volume machines which are no longer economically viable under the charging regime.He said NoteMachine has always operated a free-to-use model wherever possible and continued: ldquoHowever, unless urgent action is taken to reduce the pressure on ATM operators by reversing the interchange fee reductions, NoteMachine will be forced to begin converting ATMs to surcharging.ldquoThis is a dilemma we have been grappling with for some time and are extremely reluctant to make such a decision.A recentAccess to Cash Review chaired by former chief of the Financial Ombudsman Service Natalie Ceeney described the cash system as ldquoon the verge of collapse.Which  said that while digital payments are on the rise in the UK, . million people are almost entirely reliant on cash in their daily lives.It warned that the UK risks drting into a ldquono-cash society which could shut people out of paying for local goods and services.The consumer champion is urging the Government to appoint a regulator to ensure no-one is denied the ability to access cash.

Now, however, it is time to bid readers of these pages adieu – or more appropriately, au revoir.I need to take my leave for the foreseeable future as I have decided to contest the European elections I would rather were not being held in the UK at all. So that columnists do not gain an advantage for themselves or a party it is a Scotsman convention thatthey take part in elections they step back from their regular slot. Sometimes they , possibly chastened, maybe emboldened – sometimes they don’t.Over the years I have had my detractors. As a Scottish unionist libertarian I inhabit a subset of a subset that makes my writing usually contrary to the prevailing view. I can live with that, but I cannot accept a vote of the people being ignored.Thus I am, paradoxically, about to stand as a Brexit Party candidate for the European Parliament I have argued our country should no longer be part of. I believe strongly this election puts the people’s trust in democracy at great risk.To maintain our belief in the value of voting, especially in referenda where everyone’s vote counts, it is necessary to give a voice to the anger, the disgust and the disappointment that many now hold for the politicians who have lied persistently and without shame about honouring the result of the  vote to leave the EU.Some readers might remember the time when a majority of those Scots who voted in the referendum of  supported the creation of a Scottish assembly – but not in great enough numbers to meet the legal threshold that would make it a reality. There was palpable outrage among many that the decision did not count. Imagine then that the vote for a Scottish Parliament in the referendum of  had been ignored by the Labour government of the day that had promised to deliver it  Or imagineScotland had voted for independence in  and three years later the SNP government had, despite repeated promises, failed to deliver it – encouraged to fail by a Westminster government serving a cocktail of threats, bullying and political chicanery.The electorate would be beyond itself with anger and indignation, incredulous that a democratic decision had not been respected and honoured.I have warned many times from these pages that the Conservative Government and the Labour opposition are trying the patience of the voters for stating they would abide by the vote to leave the EU on  June  only to continually go back on their word. I cannot recall a period, certainly not in this country nor in my letime, when so many promises have been made – and repeated for emphasis – only to be broken without any concern for the damage it does to the credibility of all politicians or the debasement of democracy.I cannot recall ever a British Cabinet that has so callously abandoned collective responsibility so government becomes anarchic and impotent – and ministers might vote against their official position but carry on taking their superannuated paycheque.I cannot believe a British government would be so willing to accept one part of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, would operate under dferent commercial regulations where the only recourse to representation about such damaging rules would be through representatives of a neighbouring foreign power. Nor can I believe the same government cannot see its dalliance with a second referendum only strengthens the hands of separatists in Scotland who wish for a second vote too.The leaders of both main parties opposed Brexit and lost. They defined what Brexit would look like , that there would be no EU army, and amplied at full volume the immediate economic crisis we would facewe voted against their advice . Yet, for all the foregoing scaremongering the electorate decided in our biggest democratic vote ever to “take back control” of our laws, our money and our borders. Since then we have seen the creation of an EU army and the surreptitious offer of our military forces to it. We have seen the best growth of the largest economies in the EU, witnessed our employment grow by a staggering , and the UK become the top destination for foreign investment in the world.It was as a result of the electorate’s expressed will the new Prime Minister, Theresa May, promised us “Brexit means Brexit” – only for her to ensure in her tin-eared dogmatic detachment that now Brexit must mean remain. Her withdrawal treaty will mean continuing with the very rules and regulations we were told could be reformed or abolished, that direct trade deals with other nations cannot be realised and that customs tarfs that ensure our food and clothing costs more cannot be reduced.We will leave the Common Fisheries Policy one minute only to rejoin it immediately the next. Worse still, being an international treaty it cannot be amended and offers us no break clause for escape. With so many of May’s promises broken her words and phrases have lost all meaning when “no deal” was once “better than a bad deal” – it is now her bad deal.The law of the land was we would “leave the EU on  March”. Conservative and Labour MPs voted together by a huge majority for it to happen, deal or no deal. If they had been sincere in their promises we would now have left and no elections would be necessary. I have previously been invited toto the political fray, but on all occasions I found it easy to decline. This time is dferent, this time giving electors a means to defend democracy itself by campaigning for a party that believes in having the referendum respected is something I cannot ignore, despite the economic risk to my livelihood.So it is au revoir as I join others of all walks of le, from left and right, all races, religions and genders – but who believe democracy matters.I thank you all for you comments in the past, be they supportive or critical. The result I cannot predict, but democracy will have been given the opportunity to triumph over cynicism.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"we need to stop lying about dundee being the best place to live kevan christie","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...OK, we need to stop lying about Dundee being the best place in Scotland, the UK, Europe, the World and the Universe to live ... there I#ve said it. Take me outside, tie me to a pole, light me a fag and don#t bother with the blindfold.The idea of ‘Best Place To Live’is stupid and patrionising, which is just a lazy PR concept.It’s the Emperor’s New Clothes for the ‘creatives mafia’ in any city, which in the case of Dundee comprises of around  people spread out between the West End, Broughty Ferry and the burgeoning town of Newport-on-Tay which for the uninitiated happens to be in Fe.It lets the cooncil off the hook and allows them to focus all their energies into talking the place up while ignoring the hard stuff that needs done like providing care for the elderly which won’t win them awards or plaudits.It fosters a culture of positivity at all costs where the first casualty is always the truth – sweep the bad stuff under the carpet – we do le sciences here don’t you know The city of jute, jam and journalism was named Scotland’s BPTL earlier this month by the Sunday Times, hot-on-the-heels of coming sixth on Lonely Planet’s Best in Europe  list of places to visit. The media barrage since the opening of the new VA franchise store on the waterfront has been held up by luvvies everywhere as a classic example of how a bit of the old culture can drag a place out of the doldrums with a slice of bread and jam for everyone.: VA Dundee named the world’s best public buildingI don’t buy it, like I don’t buy the opposite side of the spectrum which labels a place “drug capital of Europe” – as happened to Edinburgh in the s – with the focus shting from the VA to Dundee having the highest rate of drug deaths in Europe.Makes for punchy headlines – evendrug deaths aren’t recorded on a like-for-like basis across the continent. If culture is the be-all and end-all then surely London would have no kne crime given the huge choice of galleries and museums on offer in the teeming metropolis.No doubt Dundee’s fake valium problems – and I shy away from using the word epidemic – have been acute with the local authorities needing to do more, particularly in terms of providing addiction support services.But the tired media narrative framed around the place highlights the duality of over-the-top coverage of the opening of a museum being followed up with the horror story of drug deaths.There is no room for the middle ground where the real truth lies.Rather like the theory of inverse care in health, where those who need it most receive the least, an influx of professional types into one area will substantially improve it simply because they shout the loudest. The middle-class are brilliant at advocating change and will complain about anything and everything, especiallyit impacts on the lives of their precious little darlings.: Le expectancy in Dundee falls as Glasgow worst in ScotlandThey are also media-savvy and will hit Twitter and Facebook like billy-oh , for example, the bins are not getting picked up quickly enough. You only have to walk a mile or so from any ‘trendy’ place in Scotland’s cities and you’ll find abject poverty. The poor don’t benefit from the regeneration with not so much as an out-of-date avocado thrown their way.I have friends and family from Dundee, lived across the road in Tayport for seven years and like the area and the people. I know Dundonians who take the absolute mickey out of all the hype surrounding the place and others who think anyone not talking it up to the nth degree deserves a swt ‘punch in the pus’.I consider my home in a Fe mining village to be my current BPTL. It includes an ice-cream shop, a target shooting shop, one that sells crystals, a solitary pub called The Crystal, a Chinese takeaway and a unisex haridresser called Kutz for U. I have hot and cold running water, toothpaste and Netflix.

Mr Mackay said today one of these is the “financial requirements of Scottish residents and businesses.” Others include bringing down the country’s deficit, as well as building up cash reserves and credibility of the country’s new central bank.“Our proposals are to keep the pound in the immediate term,” he added.“An SNP Government will take the steps necessary to enable the Scottish Parliament to authorise the preparation of a Scottish currency as soon as practicable after independence.”Nationalist MSP Bruce Crawford, convener of Holyrood’s Finance committee, also sought to play down the impact of the new policy. “The currency that the people of Scotland will use the day before anindependence vote will be the same currency they will use the day after, the day after that and the day after that - that being the pound.”But the Tory Finance spokesman Murdo Fraser accused the SNP of seeking to backtrack on its new economic plan.“That’s been three days since the vote at his conference and already the cabinet Secretary is in full retreat form the position set out at the conference,” he said. Labour Finance spokesman James Kellysaid the pound would be “immediately replaced” by a new Scottish currency.“The effect this would have on people’s mortgages, savings and pensions is that they would need to be converted into a new currency from sterling at a cost of up to %.“This would have a catastrophic impact on business and the economy.”Scottish families and businesses would be “signicantly worse off”, he added.For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"former minister sarah boyack to replace kezia dugdale as msp","story":"A former Scottish cabinet secretary, who served under Donald Dewar, willto Holyrood to replace Kezia Dugdale when the former Scottish Labour leader quits front line politics this summer.Sarah Boyack will take the list seat set to be vacated by Ms Dugdale, who yesterday announced her decision to stand down as an MSP and take up a role as director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service in Glasgow University.Ms Boyack said she was ing to deal with “unfinished business.”Currently head of public affairs role with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, she was an MSP for Edinburgh Central constituency from the very first days of the Scottish Parliament, which is celebrating its th anniversary this year.: Kezia Dugdale says new role is ‘unique opportunity’She served as Minister for the Environment, Planning and Transport in the first two years of the new Scottish Executive before becoming Minister for Transport, during which time she introduced one of Scottish Labour’s flagship policies of free bus travel for people over  and disabled people.While she lost her seat in the  election to the SNP’s Marco Biagi she still ed to Holyrood as a list MSP.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

Kieran and his we Pauline had made their home in Loughbrickland in recent years, but he was a Portadown nativethrough and through.

Such was his status in the car trade that the family have decided to wind the business up. They feel that nobody could fill his shoes, and run the business with the same energy and commitment as Kieran Lamph – quite a tribute to a unique man. His enthusiasm for everything he did was best summed up by his eldest son Christopher during Mass at St John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church, which was attended by an estimated , mourners. Speaking on behalf of his mother Pauline and his siblings Conor, Ciara and Orla, Christopher said, “We are overwhelmed by the support we have had today. I know dad will be looking down, feeling impressed with the numbers he has pulled in. “Dad’s greatest quality was his generosity. He was the kindest and most thoughtful man I have ever met. You didn’t have to ask him, he just did it. He derived genuine pleasure out of helping people, no job was too big. He raised tens of thousands of pounds over the years for ious charities – his favourite was dressing up as Santa and creating a grotto in his officethat would have put Castle Court to shame. All the money he raised went to SVP .” As well as we Pauline and family, Kieran is survived by brothers Niall, Dessie and Gareth. He was predeceased by Adrian, an innocent victim who was murdered in  at the civic amenity site at the Fair Green where he worked for Craigavon Borough Council.

He was educated at St Columba’s School, Carleton Street, and St Malachy’s and always had a talent as a salesman. This was developed after schooldays at the former Berwoods store at the Market Street-Woodhouse Street corner, where he sold household furniture and kitchen furniture, after which he joined the motor trade with Irish Road Motors, ending his career with them at Highfield as sales director. The closure of Irish Road was the catalyst for him to strike out on his own. He created Kieran Lamph Motors, which reflected his vision, dealing in top-of-the-range vehicles like Range Rover and Mercedes and in the used trade, providing a wide range of motors – he operated from ious sites, like Bleary, Gilford, Loughbrickland and Portadown at ious times. Christopher explained, “Dad could sell ice to the Eskimos, a born salesman. He was larger than le and thrived when he was selling anything, but particularly cars. At one point he was exporting thousands of cars a month across several European countries. He could spot an opportunity in any situation. He had this unstoppable drive and ambition, his personality was infectious.” But while he was a successful businessman, Kieran Lamph shared his success and talents with the community. He sponsored sporting clubs both financially and with trophies. His charity work was legendary. He was a staunch supporter of St Vincent de Paul, and as well as his grotto and other projects, he would treat the organisation’s volunteers to Christmas dinner. He also organised charity walks for a friend who lost a leg in an accident, raising a substantial amount for the Royal Victoria Hospital’s Intensive Care Unit. And he jet-skied around the entire shore of Lough Neagh to raise £, for Marie Curie – just a sample of his charity work over the years.Support for church fundraiser success Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\" Most of all, he was a devoted family man, close to his we and children and to his brothers. His home at Loughbrickland was his pride and joy, especially his immaculate . acre garden which he loved to tend, relaxing as he cultivated his plants and flowers and his herb garden. He also had a -foot pond in which he kept several Koi Carp fish, another of his all-consuming hobbies. Christopher toldmourners – “Dad was a great family man, who did everything for us. He always put our needs and those of mum before his own. He was so proud of all our achievements.” He finished his eulogy, “We love you dad.” Requiem Mass was conducted by Fr Colm Wright and interment was at the adjoining cemetery."},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"A schoolboy from Co Down has embarked on a letter-writing campaign to some of the UK#s most powerful people, voicing concerns that it is not compulsory to wear a cycling helmet.

His integrity was unquestionable. He was true gentleman. He will be greatly missed in the field of education,” the school said.Portadown College community statement in full: Tribute paid to Portadown College principal Simon Harper Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"On Good Friday,  April , the College Community lost not only our highly esteemed Principal with the untimely passing of Simon Harper, but a much valued colleague and dearfriend too.From attending his very first College event, the  Carol Service before officially assuming the reigns of Portadown College on  April , Simon lived out the College motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” with “Courage and Courtesy” in every aspect of his le.Already a successful and experienced Headmaster on his arrival in Portadown, Simon was a highly charismatic educator and leader. He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"yfc get on their bike with 75km for 75 years","story":"Rathfriland Young Farmers Club are set to kick off their th anniversary celebrations with a bang this weekend.The club are delighted to announce their first event to commemorate the milestone anniversary with a sponsored cycle challenge.

They’ve been to an All-Ireland semi-final and they know when to stop the game and they have a few marquee players. I thought our boys matched them. We were under the cosh at times, but our boys showed desire and pride too. The conditions were dficult and we saw some of the shots and passes out there – the game was probably lucky to be played, but the surface was fine.”The teams were closely matched for the first  minutes with Antrim’s Paudie McLaughlin cancelling out an early Liam McDonald free for Monaghan.However, the hosts were dealt a blow when full-back Emmett Irvine, who had impressed in the early stages, picked up a black card after  minutes and the Farneymen assumed control for the remainder of the half with scores from Jason Irwin, Darragh Dempseyand McDonaldputting them - to - ahead at the break.Antrim’s second and final point arrived via a well-taken effort from Daniel McNicholl while Irwin landed his second of the evening on  minutes.Yet, the Monaghan captain, booked in the first half, picked up a second yellow for a high tackle moments later and the visitors were guilty of some cynical fouling as they looked to preserve their lead.Another Dempsey free moved them four clear inside the final  minutes and they looked to have done enough to seal victory.Antrim’s Ryan Lennon was black-carded for a third-man tackle, but a clever pass across the face of goal in stoppage time from Reuben Carleton allowed McNally to palm the ball past Joe Kirk in the Monaghan goal.Monaghan corner-forward McDonald was issued with a straight red for a strike while Antrim didn’t have time to muster a late equaliser.McAllister’s men must quickly regroup for the Qualiers as they will face Armagh in the Athletic Grounds on Saturday afternoon.ANTRIM: J Rodgers R Carleton, E Irvine, M Ferris R Hagan, E Higgins, S O’Callaghan J McNally -, D McNicholl - R McKillop, S Madden, C Higgins P McLaughlin -, R Lennon, R Boyle.Subs: C Killough for Irvine , M Lynch for Higgins .

I was delighted to be able to update the community face-to-face at the inaugural ‘Empowerment through engagement’ public meeting in the newly-built Good Shepherd Parish Centre. We took those present through the criteria obtained from the Department for Infrastructure for each of the locations. There followed a very constructive conversation with the local stakeholders present. The residents, school, youth and sporting organisation leaders all had ideas about how we could work together to build a profile to meet the department’s requirements, thus speeding up progress and change. We then arranged a face-to-face meeting between the stakeholders and the department. We voiced our concerns, including the fact that, at no time in the assessment process for new crossings, was there a public consultation.Such was the success of the meeting that arrangements were made for a second meeting on mental health, an interactive session with the superb local organisations Aware, Inspire and PIPS. Each of these bodies showcased what they do and how we can improve mental wellbeing in our area. Again, the focus was on introducing the local community to important organisations who can help us to access better services.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in.

Pauline Leeson, chief executive of umbrella group Children in Northern Ireland, who sat on the inquiry committee, said the growing number of children living in food poverty is \"unacceptable\".\"The number of people using food banks in Northern Ireland has risen by over % in the last  months with more than , three-day emergency food packages given to people – with more than , of these going to children,\" she said.\"We should be providing our children and young people with the best start in le, instead we are hindering their growth, affecting their confidence and making it impossible for them to learn and develop.\"The growing number of children in Northern Ireland living in food poverty is unacceptable and more needs to be done to support these children and their families in order for them to have access to healthy and affordable food.

If you open a calendar on any given week you will find a reason for politicians to hold off engaging with each other..pushMarching season, conference season, elections, pressure in Westminster, negotiations in Brussels and issues within inidual parties are just a few examples.Little more than a week ago the usual script had been written, and was widely accepted, for the weeks ahead.Politicians in Westminster, Brussels, Dublin and Belfast were taking an Easter break in the assumption that there could be no engagement while local and European election campaigns were being fought in Northern Ireland in May. The script said the parties were on the doorsteps and would inevitably maintain partisan politics until the elections had past.Just after pm on Thursday April  that script was torn up by the senseless and heartbreaking murder of a woman whose name we have all come to know, Lyra McKee, whom, by the outstanding tributes of her partner, family and friends, we all wish we had known in le.As a politician and Tanaiste there are many things you experience that are unique but there are only a handful of experiences that you know will stay with you until the end of your days.Being in the front pews of St Annes Cathedral as an unstoppable wave of applause, hope and demand hit the most senior politicians from the UK and Ireland in the base of our spines is one such moment I will never forget.The words of Father Martin Magill summed up the desire and frustration of all communities in Northern Ireland in a sentence,\"Why in Gods name does it take the death of the -year old woman, with her whole le in front of her, to get to this point \"Last summer violence in Derry saw live bullets being fired and police officers narrowly escaping injury or death. In January seven young people were minutes from being killed after they passed the car bomb that sat in the centre of Derry. However, on April  the cowards claimed a victim. The fact that it was a journalist and writer who was a shining example of everything Northern Ireland can achieve is the reason so many people have come together to mourn.The night before Lyra McKees funeral I sat in Strand Road police station in Derry with the officers who had tried to save her le. These men and women are hardened by the fact that petrol bombs can be thrown at them in the course of their everyday work but on Tuesday night they were numbed and vulnerable at the fact that a young woman had died beside them. Despite their Land Rovers being alight with petrol and live ammunition being fired at them, the PSNI left its secure position to get to Lyra McKee after she had been hit. They made the decision to drive to Altnagelvin Hospital, officers performed CPR on Lyra for the entire journey and they stayed and supported her partner and friends as the horrible news of her death was confirmed. The leadership shown by the PSNI in Derry has rightly been applauded by the community it serves.While I heard Father Magills rallying call for political leadership loud and clear, I also heard what he said about the events in Derry as the news of Lyras murder sunk in: \"I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday.\"Arlene Foster, Michelle ONeill, Colum Eastwood, Robin Swann and Naomi Long were not ordered to release a joint statement by anyone or told to go into the Creggan. When a dark moment threatened to drag Northern Ireland back to a dark past their natural inclination was to do the right thing.We now have a window where the Irish and British Governments are calling the parties together. We have all spoken in person and on the phone many times in the last week and without exception I believe all the party leaders are genuine in their desire toto Stormont.As we meet in the weeks ahead, a conversation I had with Mrs Joan McKee will be foremost in my mind.Standing in the side chapel of St Annes was the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as well as myself as Tanaiste, the Secretary of State and ministers of both governments. Despite all the power of those elected offices we were standing there as a group that was utterly powerless to comfort a woman who had, as Joan put it, \"lost her baby\".We owe it to Joan and Lyra McKee to make sure no other ceasefire babies are murdered in the prime of their lives and to make sure that Northern Ireland has a ing government.There is never a perfect time to do the right thing in Northern Ireland. However, there is a right time and that time is now.Simon Coveney is Tanaiste of the Republic of Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"eleven men convicted over unnotified republican parade in derry","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The District Judge saidthe fines were not paid within the next twenty-six weeks, the matter would be referred to the Fine Collection Agency.CCTV footage of the parade which took place in Central Drive in the Creggan area on the afternoon of April , , was played in court. Several police officers gave evidence of public disorder prior to the parade during which petrol bombs were thrown at police Landrovers by groups of masked youths. Between them the officers said during their evidence that they were able to identy eleven of the twelve defendants, as well as six other men who were not charged with the offence.A PSNI Inspector told the court that prior to the parade he and other officers went to Junior McDaid house in Chamberlain Street where he planned to explain to the parade organisers that as the parade was unnotied, those taking part were liable to prosecution. He said the doors and shutters on the house were closed and he put a warning letter in the letter box of the house.The police witness said he then went to the Creggan along with an evidence gathering crew and as TSG support group. There a pre-recorded message warning that the parade was illegal was played from police Landrovers which also contained signs that the parade was unnotied.The officer said at the scene of the parade masked youths threw petrol bombs, planks of wood and masonry at police lines during a period of sustained rioting and at one stage his officers were faced with a human wall of masked rioters.A Chief Inspector said in the lead up to the parade he had unsuccessfully attempted to engage with members of the community in order to reach a resolution.The Chief Inspector said he initially deployed a minimum of officers but had to increase their numbers because of the rioting.Two police constables said in evidence that they identied most of the defendants following a controlled viewing of CCTV footage recorded by the P.S.N.I. at the scene.The District Judge said the evidence against the defendants consisted of police CCTV footage as well as police statements. He said the defendants had exercised their right not to give evidence and that was their prerogative.\"The evidence of the police constables is quite clear. This was an unnotied parade within the terms of the legislation. The police had no intention of stopping nor interfering with the procession,\" he said.\"If it had been notied the police would have been observing from a distance but they had to attend in case people goose stepped around in paramilitary garb and that is an offence and because there may be preparations being made to attack police in the area.\"The police moved in, observed those taking part in the parade and identied a number of people with the exception of one of them who case has been adjourned in order to allow a legal matter to be examined. Even in the absence of anything to the contrary the case has been made out against all defendants so they will be convicted on the evidence.\"There are relevant previous convictions in this case. It is clear this event lead to serious public disorder and a display of paramilitary activity of a quite unacceptable nature. However no one has been charged with that. They are charged with taking part in an unnotied procession. Maybe they do not agree with the law but it applies to everybody across the board\", he added.The District Judge said while people had the right to parade, there were too many processions in Northern Ireland. He said parades organisers were responsible for ensuring there were no paramilitary displays at parades.\"Whether or not they agree with the law they are bound by it. That is the way society has to work\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland catholic school population surges to record high","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I phoned Nathan to tell him the news but he didnt believe me at first because this shouldnt happen to a full pedigree dog.\"The vet actually told me that a lot of people in my shoes would consider putting the dog down but its not a consideration for us. \"We love her the way she is.\"After the startling revelation, Nikki had to take Dolly to a specialist vet for an initial procedure \"to have everything removed\" last week.More corrective surgery is now necessary in order to treat the rare condition, and despite Dollys young age, she will need to be spayed, with the total cost likely to reach somewhere in the region of £,.\"The next operation, which is due in two or three weeks, is going to be a more painful one for her, where shell get some reconstruction work done,\" Nikki said.Fortunately, when Nikki bought Dolly she took out pet insurance that covers the bulk of the vet fees, leaving her with the £ excess to pay.\"I couldnt have afforded to pay thousands of pounds to help her so in any other circumstances she probably wouldve been put down,\" she admitted.\"That would have been heartbreaking for me because it took me so long to find her in the first place. Id been looking for a dog like her for months.\"Having both male and female sex organs can cause her problems in adulthood, according to the vet, which may make her become aggressive.\"Ive been told that because she is a hermaphrodite, evenshe didnt have the operation, she is not allowed to breed. \"That doesnt worry me. I just want her to be happy and healthy. Shes been in the wars for a dog so young, but shes adorable, just like any normal puppy.\"Nikki, who is getting married next July, said the specialist vet told her hed \"never seen anything like this before\", adding that \"shes just a very mixed dog\".The puppy is also in a lot of pain, according to her owner, because its dficult for her to get comfortable.\"She cant sit properly, she flags her bum to the sidewe tell her to sit because its too painful for her due to the position of some of the internal organs,\" she explained.She also revealed the origin of the puppys name, adding that she now has her own dedicated Instagram page - @dollythemixture.She said: \"I love Dolly Parton, so I originally chose the name Dolly after her. \"Then I was a wee bit confused about what to call her until one of the gymnasts in my class came up with Dolly the Mixture.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield. Between pound and pound was raised.Itrsquos not the first time Mr Harper, minister of Ballygowan Presbyterian Church, has come up with unusual ideas to raise money. When ministering in Killyleagh he took part in a sponsored bed push and also cycled on a tandem.Coping with the penny farthing proved easier than Mr Harper expected. ldquoIt was remarkably comfortable and I felt really refreshed after the journey, he said.ldquoThere was only one problem mdash it had no brakes, but the police helped us by going ahead to make sure the way was clear.The penny farthing dates from  and is ft in high. Mr Harper only got one half-hour practice to get the feel of it before setting out on the y journey.DOWNPATRICK mdash A proposal to locate a regional museum in Downpatrick has been supported by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Board members want to be involved in the museumrsquos management together with local councillors.The recommendation is that the museum should be the responsibility of the district council, but Board member Mr Jack Magee believes the concept is too narrow.Board members want top priority to be given to recruiting a pool of staff for regional museums and that they should be seconded for proper professional training to acquire a professional qualication.Meanwhile, Down Council is pressing ahead with its own plans to establish a museum in Downpatrick.The council museum was started before the announcement that Downpatrick had been nominated as the location for a regional museum and it is believed that the council museum will be used as the basis for the regional museum.Councillors have accepted that it will be some time before money will be made available for the appointment of museum staff, so a full-time curator is now needed to enable their lsquoDown Museumrsquo to progress properly.It has been confirmed that until the appointment is made, Mr Albert Colmer, chairman of the Lecale Historical Society, will continue to act as curator.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford Ferry fares will be increased next week, despite strong protests from Ards and Down councillors and members of Portaferry Development Committee.Representatives from all three groups recently met with the Department of Roads Service, which operates the ferry, and were told that the increases were the absolute minimum which could be implemented.Down councillor Mr John Ritchie said he was told that the fares should meet at least % of the servicersquos running costs, which now stood at nearly pound, a year.KILLYLEAGH mdash The blueprint for Killyleaghrsquos one-day festival of family fun in June was revealed at a public meeting in the Cooke Hall in the town.The planned programme, ranging from car slalom, marathon darts, senior citizensrsquo talent contest and yard of ale competition, makes impressive reading, attempting as it does to involve the whole community.ldquoWe must put Killyleagh on the map, was the message message hammered home at the meeting by Mr Winston Maguire, chairman of Killyleagh Town Committee.The organisers received an enormous boost when local hotelier Mr Harry Briggs offered free of charge for three nights the main hall of the Dunmore Hotel.The organisers have appealed for sponsorship, especially donations for prizes. The townspeople will not only enjoy the one-day festival, but any profits made from the event will be ploughed back to provide Christmas lights for the townrsquos streets.DRUMAROAD mdash Outbreaks of sheep worrying hit the area at the weekend when more than  lambs were savagely attacked and killed by marauding dogs.Mr P J McGrady, a farmer from Drumaroad, lost ten lambs over the weekend, He spotted a black dog with white spots on his land and he rushed into his house for his shotgun, but the dog had gone when he went outside.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A pair of talented Ballynahinch sisters, Lesley and Gail Newham, are among four students from the South Eastern Music Centre who travelled to Grantham in Lincolnshire with the British Youth Symphony Orchestra this week.This is the second year in succession that the sisters have been chosen to join the  young musicians from all over the UK who will be giving concerts for the next two weeks.Mr David Newham, father of  year-old Lesley, who plays a horn, and  year-old Gail, an oboeist, is director and advisor of music for the South Eastern Education and Library Board.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A speedboat with the engine still attached was found drting in Strangford Lough close to Don OrsquoNeill Island on Saturday by Mr Paul McCann, of  Springvale Park, Dpwnpatrick.The speedboat was taken to a temporary mooring at Castleward Bay provided by Strangford Sailing Club.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

As he sat on top of the mountain with no name, counting all the athletes as they reached the summit and the yellow sun began to set over the rolling green hills, he thought to himself that this was truly a place of beauty to be shared with like-minded people.

A massive congratulations to all of the juniors who entered and hopefully we can encourage even more for the next junior race at Binnian.The ladiesrsquo event followed a similar vein with last weekrsquos winner Esther Dickson, of Newry AC in dominate form.Second place was Karen Wilton and Sarah Graham romped home in third. Poor Sarah, however, was cornered by McNeilly in the Avoca at the presentation, who was heard regaling her of his past triumphs, including his  minute k and  minute  miler.Perhaps there was some consolation for Sarah in that she wasnrsquot subjected to Joe McCann recounting his illustrious Armagh .

Main buildings around the world were turned green to mark this day.ldquoAnd, as the Good Friday Agreement comes under pressure, St Patrick speaks to a shared heritage across this island. And he should be a force for reconciliation right now.Mr Coveney added: ldquoThere should never be ision in this island and we should share the richness of his story. St Patrick is a treasure to us all.ldquoA treasure to those of faith and to those with no faith at all. He challenged this island and found courage, redemption and transformation.The Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, discussed the grave of St Patrick with Mr Coveney and other clergy and politicians.Dean Hull added: ldquoSt Patrick probably died in his church at Saul and was driven by a cart and four oxen, which settled on the hill in Downpatrick, where he was buried. As was the custom, Patrickrsquos remains were subject to becoming reliquaries and part of his jaw bone is in the Down County Museum today..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traders fume at roadworks delay  ","story":"WORK on a major public realm scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned, sparking a furious reaction from traders.Work on the near pound, scheme was due to complete at the end of March but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced. It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening. If the work can be completed ahead of schedule this would be welcomed, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Work set to resume at old Downe  ","story":"BUILDING work on a new social housing project at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick is due to resume in the near future.Contractors moved off site a few weeks ago after laying foundations for a number of new homes whichare being built on behalf of Clanmill Housing.An initial  homes are being built part as part of a major social housing project at the site where around  new homes could eventually be constructed.While concern has recently been expressed locally about the halt to construction work at the site,Clanmill has explained that there is a valid reason.The social housing provider said it is aware that work at the sprawling town centre site mdash which borders four main roads mdash has ceased for a short period of time.ldquoThe developerrsquos subcontractor is awaiting the arrival on site of a piling rig to allow work to continue, she explained.ldquoWe appreciate the continued support and patience of local residents as construction continues and are looking forward to welcoming families to the first phase of the development later in the year as planned.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.Itrsquos understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, is pleased that the suspension to building work is only temporary.ldquoThe redevelopment of the former hospital site will go some way to reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick, he said.ldquoThe Clanmill project is an eagerly awaited development. Not only will it provide much-needed new homes, but greatly assist with the social and economic regeneration of this particular part of the town. People are eager to see the first tenants move into their new homes and the transformation of this particular site.Cllr Curran said he is also pleased that tenants could be in their new homes later in the year.ldquoWe have a number of people on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category. They will no doubt be eagerly monitoring the progress of building work at the old Downe complex, he continued.Cllr Curran added: ldquoHaving viewed plans for the redevelopment of the entire site, I can say that they are particularly impressive and will transform what had become a blot on the landscape into a vibrant, and much-needed social housing development..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17590037.skins-win-towns-cup-for-first-time-since-1937/resources/images/9783052.jpg","title":"life without art would be empty and unsatisfying","story":"JC: What is your artistic background JC: What inspires your art JC: Is there a specic place that you do your work JC: What has been your most ambitious piece to date JC: What dferent artistic media do you use and which is your favourite JC: What are you currently working on JC: Do you exhibit your work anywhere JC: Any new artistic ventures planned for  JC: What are you up to when you arenrsquot painting JC: What does your art mean to you This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

eight, episode three of Game of Thrones. Directed by Miguel Sapochnik – who also helmed fan-favourite episodes including ‘Hardhome’ and ‘Battle of the Bastards’ – last night’s instalment ‘The Long Night’ was billed as one of the longest and largest battle scenes ever committed to film or TV.And while the episode was filled with explosive and grisly scenes of warfare, some have been complaining that they were straining to see the battle, due to the episode’s apparently darker-than-usual cinematography.One Twitter user wrote: “Tried to watch Game Of Thrones tonight but the episode was too dark to see anything. It sounded very exciting though!”Another said: “I’ve been watching ep for  minutes, still don’t know what’s going on it’s too dark.”Some have suggested that people could have solved the issue by adjusting the settings on their TV’s, with one person stating: “Did people forget they can increase the brightness and contrast on their TVs ”Another claimed it may have been due to the limitations of streaming services: “One of the reasons for the ‘it’s too dark’ complaints about the new Game of Thrones is because so many will be streaming it. Many streaming services are still poor when it comes to video encoding for dark scenes.”However, plenty of viewers seemed to have no problem and were left wondering what all the fuss was about“Turn your light off, close your blinds and stop whining,” one Twitter user wrote.Another said: “I saw what I needed to see. Arya kicked butt. And the red woman came back and helped. Theon protected Bran till the end. Jorah protected Dany.”“I guess its winterfell’s fault for not having proper street lighting,” joked another.Man dies after being hit by two vehicles in Hampshire town Cranleigh School opens new

three places to Arlene Fosters right at the DUP manesto launch earlier this monthAlthough the two were never formally linked, it was the church which provided not just many of the early DUP candidates, but also the foot soldiers who enthusiastically campaigned for the upstart party which would smash Northern Ireland’s political establishment.There were always criticisms from some in both church and party who saw the tension between a secular party with ambitions of winning votes and a fundamentalist church with the aim of saving souls.But those largely lay below the surface until Paisley’s decision to enter government with Sinn Fein, something which dismayed many in the church, who had been taught to view Sinn Fein in theological terms as the representatives of evil. The church gave Paisley an ultimatum: Choose to remain as moderator or remain as first minister. He opted for the latter and, after  years, was replaced as moderator.In his blistering valedictory interview with Eamonn Mallie in , Paisley said that his church critics “do not have the ear of God on this matter [power-sharing with Sinn Fein]”, a claim which appeared almost sacrilegious to some within the church. He also said that his family no longer entered his former church – although his son Kyle remains a Free Presbyterian cleric in England.Then in December  the church criticised the party for allowing retrospective pardons of those convicted of homosexual offences to pass through the Assembly. In implicit praise of the DUP’s nemesis, the church said that the proposal “was opposed only by Mr Allister of the TUV while sadly many others remained silent”. The church said it was “deeply grieved and bitterly disappointed” at the failure of MLAs to oppose the pardons.Now the uneasy relationship between a party which sees the strategic value in secularising and a church which believes that God’s law is unchangeable have ed with the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as one of its council candidates. Ms Bennington has said she is standing “based on what I can deliver as a councillor ... not based on my sexual orientation”, and it is clear that the party leadership has endorsed what in any other party would be a fairly unremarkable stance.Ms Bennington was chosen centrally by the party, itself an indication that the party was taking a strategic decision to test the waters with its supporters. But for a party which once campaigned under the banner ‘Save Ulster from sodomy’ for homosexuality to remain a criminal offence, it is nevertheless a striking indication of how the DUP is changing.Traditionalist DUP MLA Jim Wells, who is currently suspended by the party, has been outspoken about what he described as a hint of “a major – and very worrying – change in the policy of the DUP on social issues”.On Saturday, TUV leader Jim Allister said he was struck in canvassing “by the number of lelong DUP voters dismayed by what they see as their party’s softening on the gay marriage issue because of the Bennington nomination”.Mr Wells yesterday said that “many, many DUP members up to the highest level”, including MPs, MLAs and former ministers, had been in contact with him to express concern about the issue because it was “a huge change in the ethos and tradition of the DUP”.Free Presbyterian sadness at the political normalisation of relations that contravene Scripture Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The South Down MLA said that there was concern within the party that it was “a step towards other radical change” and that people who had in some cases been members of the party for  years “simply cannot come to terms with this decision”.At the weekend, DUP veteran John Carson, posted on Facebook about the decision. The Ballymena councillor, who is standing for re-election on Thursday, said that he had been aDUP member for  years but “I say quite openly and with no fear of the consequences ‘NOT IN MY NAME’. I first entered politics because of my admiration for Dr Ian RK Paisley and ... I make no apologies to anyone for saying I am an old Paisleyite.”He went on: “I believe in the coming days not only myself but many of us will have some soul-searching to do and some tough decisions to make”. Invoking images of Old Testament idolatry, Mr Carson asked people to pray for wisdom for “those of us who have not bowed the knee to baal” as they “stand against evil in these days”.On Saturday, the presbytery officers of the Free Presbyterian Church issued a statement which was unusually oblique for a denomination known for its full-frontal assaults on those it regards as acting sinfully. The statement, a clear response to the DUP move, did not name the party but said that it “underlines its opposition to all marital and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of Scripture.”The statement was read out in some Free Presbyterian churches on Sunday, although not in others, in what may be a hint of the church – as well as the party – being split on the issue.Although a tiny denomination, Free Presbyterianism has long exerted an influence which exceeds its size, both through the DUP and its frequent pronouncements to the media about issues of public morals.One church source said that there was a desire among some within the congregation to see DUP party officers who are members of the church disciplined for their role in Ms Bennington’s selection.In response to the church’s statement, the DUP merely said: “Our position on support for traditional marriage is well known and as the party leader indicated last week, it has not changed.”An academic study, published as the book The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest To Power, four years ago found that the Free Presbyterian Church continued to wield huge influence within the party, with % of DUP members being Free Presbyterian. That meant that Free Presbyterians were  times more common in the DUP than in the population.It has been clear for some time that the DUP is no longer “the DUP at prayer”. Butthe DUP continues on its path to expand its voting base, even the continued high levels of cross-membership of church and party may increasingly become a thing of the past.If that accelerates the DUP’s liberalisation it could be signicant for everyone in Northern Ireland.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES |  photos from the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKeeSpeeder clocked at mph on

Three years on, operators Penarth Quays Marina and Vale owners have not agreed on a way to bring it back into operation. Gwynne Grfiths, chairman of the association, said: ldquoLoss of this amenity is particularly hard for those without access to a car who rely on public transport.ldquoThere is nothing mechanically wrong with the bridge. It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A spokeswoman for Cardtronics said: ldquoWe have been forced into charging a fee for cash withdrawals on some ofour machines where Linkrsquos cuts have left us with no choice.ldquoThe decision on whether to introduce a fee is taken on a case-by-case basis and reflects the economic viability of the inidual machine.ldquoWe only ever charge a fee when there is no other option apart from removing the machine altogether.Meanwhile, Peter McNamara, chief executive of cashpoint provider NoteMachine, said: ldquoThe whole Link system is now under severe threat from a toxic combination of wholesale bank branch closures, the unavoidable sht of many free-to-use machines to a charging model, and the mothballing of low volume machines which are no longer economically viable under the charging regime.He said NoteMachine has always operated a free-to-use model wherever possible and continued: ldquoHowever, unless urgent action is taken to reduce the pressure on ATM operators by reversing the interchange fee reductions, NoteMachine will be forced to begin converting ATMs to surcharging.ldquoThis is a dilemma we have been grappling with for some time and are extremely reluctant to make such a decision.A recentAccess to Cash Review chaired by former chief of the Financial Ombudsman Service Natalie Ceeney described the cash system as ldquoon the verge of collapse.Which  said that while digital payments are on the rise in the UK, . million people are almost entirely reliant on cash in their daily lives.It warned that the UK risks drting into a ldquono-cash society which could shut people out of paying for local goods and services.The consumer champion is urging the Government to appoint a regulator to ensure no-one is denied the ability to access cash. Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which , said: ldquoCommunities are being stripped of free access to cash at an alarming rate that could hit the most vulnerable in our society the hardest, while denying millions of people free withdrawals.ldquoA regulator is desperately needed to get a grip of these rapid changes across the cash landscape and ensure all those still reliant on this important payment method arenrsquot suddenly shut out from accessing the cash they need in their daily lives. John Howells, chief executive of Link, said:ldquoFree access to cash is vital for consumers and the UK enjoys extensive coverage that Link is committed to protecting.ldquoThere are more than , free-to-use ATMs across the UK, , more than we had in , and currently , pay-to-use cash machines, down from over , in .ldquoLess than % of withdrawals at Link ATMs incur a fee.ldquoFor now, there is no need for consumers to be concerned andthey wish to find their most convenient free ATM they can download the Link app for free or access cash over the counter at over , Post Offices across the UK.ldquoHowever, we agree with Which  that regulatory support is needed as there is a risk to cash access in the long run.Federation of Small Businessesnational chairman Mike Cherry said: ldquoCharging shoppers to withdraw their own money is wrong and dampens consumer appetite, causing a drag on local growth in the process.A spokesman for the Payment Systems Regulatorsaid: ldquoIn October , we gave Link a direction to make sure it does all it can to meet its commitments to protecting the broad geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs.ldquoWe are aware that some ATMs have changed from free-to-use ATMs to pay-to-use.ldquoWe are looking into this andit impacts on the commitment Link has made to us to protect the broad geographic spread of free-to-use ATMs we will take action..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Nearly , ATMs became fee-charging between January and March, says Which  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"would you do a blind interview","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business Diversity and inclusion in the workplace has never been more relevant than it is today, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays Northern IrelandIn a recent global survey by Hays for International Women’s Day, we asked over , respondents on a scale of one to five how committed their employer was to achieving gender equality. Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside.
