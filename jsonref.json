On Wednesday investors sold off shares across all sectors after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic for the first time and criticized “alarming levels of inaction” by governments in corralling the virus.The fall came as Donald Trump met with Wall Street’s most senior executives at the White House. It was the latest in a series of meetings the Trump administration has held as it works on a strategy to shore up the US economy.Trump said: “Prior to the coronavirus it was all go. The numbers were fantastic. Now we are hitting a patch. We are going to do something about getting rid of this virus as quickly as possible.“I think there will be a pent-up demand when this is gone,” he said.Trump declined to answer questions about whether or not he was considering a bailout of various troubled industries including the airlines and shale oil companies but said he would be announcing plans soon. “We are having to fix a problem that four weeks ago nobody thought would be a problem,” he said.The banking executives present stressed that the US financial system was robust. “This is not a financial crisis,” said Brian Moynihan, chief executive of Bank of America.Economists predict more falls to come. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s, predicted more sell-offs. “I can’t see people buying when the tornado is still in the backyard,” he said. Zandi now thinks a US recession is more likely than not.The Federal Reserve meets next week and is expected to cut interest rates for the second time this month in order to encourage spending and investment. But that news has not been enough to reassure investors.The Bank of England cut interest rates on Wednesday as an emergency measure but in London the FTSE 100 closed down again as did all the major European stock markets.Concerns about how the White House is handling the crisis and a political impasse in Washington are fueling investor concerns. Many investors are worried that a ided Congress will have trouble agreeing to any plan, said Kristina Hooper, Invesco’s chief global market strategist.Besides worries about the virus and the government’s ability to get something done for the economy, the market was also weighed down by a continued decline in oil prices, said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist at JP Morgan Private Bank.“I want all retail investors to expect this environment will continue: sharp down days, sharp up days,” he said. “This feeling of whiplash that people feel probably continues for some period of time.”The speed of the market’s declines and the degree of its swings the last few weeks have been breathtaking. It was only three weeks ago that the S\u0026ampP 500 set a record high.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has had six days in the last few weeks where it swung up or down by 1,000 points or more, not including Wednesday.

What do the measures he announced mean?A rapid response to Covid-19 was essential in Rishi Sunak’s first budget to staunch the threat to small businesses and workers bereft of work, facing the unknown. His “whatever it takes” for the NHS will be needed just to see that threadbare service through.For the rest, look at the numbers and you might think this splurging Keynesian budget must be Labour-designed, surely? But look at how it’s spent and you know at once it’s true-blue Tory, a Boris Johnson crowd-pleaser, a popular drink-and-drive budget, running on miles of new roads.Look north? Where people live matters less than how incomes are shared, when London has more people living below the poverty line per head than anywhere else. There’s no reform of regressive council tax in the budget: a top band two-bed semi in Blackpool worth £130,000 pays £1,624, while a £67.5m nine-bed mansion in Mayfair pays just £1,508. Without digging into these deep inequalities, there is no levelling up.Here’s the crux of the issue: Sunak echoes Johnson’s pretence that this is “the beginning of a new era”. But the Tories may struggle to wipe from the public memory those 10 years of slash-and-burn budgets they all voted for, when it will take years more for the public realm to recover.It was the new Toryism on steroids. Rishi Sunak delivered a budget that tore up the Treasury’s old rules on capital spending, provided a £30bn stimulus to fight coronavirus and a £100bn increase in public service spending by the end of this parliament: close your eyes and at times this could have been a budget delivered by a Labour chancellor rather than a Tory government in its 10th year.Instead, it heralds a new approach for a Conservative party that has once again shape-shifted in a bid to keep up with the times. Sunak’s debut budget saw the chancellor pledge sums of money that would usually be classed as eye-watering by Tory standards. But the spending spree is not all that surprising.Much of what was announced – from cuts to national insurance to funding for the NHS – was set out during the Tory election campaign. On top of this, Sunak unveiled an extensive package of measures to help businesses find a way through coronavirus turbulence and attempted to flesh out the government’s much-hyped level-up agenda. He went out of his way to pledge new funds for the metro mayors – with a special shout out for the West Midlands mayor Andy Street, as well as requests by Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen for local projects met. With the local elections in May, the Tories are taking no chances when it comes to consolidating their new “blue wall” seats.The most extraordinary thing about the budget was watching Tory MPs cheer as each spending pledge was announced. These MPs took to social media and WhatsApp to heap praise on Sunak for his smooth delivery and presence. One jokes that the big loser of the budget was Sajid Javid – who resigned last month over No 10 staffing issues. Since then, his allies have been keen to depict Sunak as a puppet of No 10.However, this budget ought to have done enough to make people at least think twice. While Sunak did find money for Dominic Cummings’ pet Arpa research project, he also did a few things his way. For now, Sunak will stick with Javid’s fiscal rules that limit day-to-day borrowing – with a decision to review in the autumn. While Tory MPs are roundly impressed with a budget delivered against the most difficult of backdrops, some sense that there could be trouble along the way. It couldn’t exactly be described as a revenue-raising budget and it isn’t yet clear how the government intends to pay for the coronavirus package. If there are unpopular decisions to be taken, they will have to come later in the parliament – and closer to the next election. Sunak has passed his first test but his next test – the autumn budget – will be even harder.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editorIn his first budget, Sunak delivered on the measly tax changes proposed in the forgettable Conservative election manifesto. The change to entrepreneurs’ relief is welcome, but far less significant than the moral outrage of the creation of a tax loophole so large it was visible from space in the first place. The novice chancellor eschewed the ambition of his hazard-prone predecessor and swerved away from a mooted “mansion tax” or straightforward wealth tax.But the truth is that there is no sustainable end to austerity without asking those at the top to contribute more. The tax changes were only remarkable for the lack of ambition that they reveal: there was no serious attempt to tax the wealthiest in society. Even basic steps such as taxing income from wealth at the same rate as income from work – as it was under Nigel Lawson in the 1980s – were notably absent. The youthful and ambitious new chancellor shows no signs of upsetting the Tory base.Once again, a Conservative government has claimed that austerity has come to an end without bothering to find the means to pay for higher levels of investment, thus revealing the moral bankruptcy of the project to slash the state. Indeed, the important increases in public investment (rising to the highest level since 1955) cannot compensate for the depleted stock of public assets as a result of 10 years of austerity, decades of underinvestment and the use of privatisation receipts to finance tax giveaways for the better-off.If Sunak were serious about changing the economy, he would have had the courage to confront the vested interests that have profited as others have had misery inflicted upon them. The failure to find the political courage shows that Sunak belongs squarely in the tradition of his Tory predecessors. The gap between rhetoric and reality remains as yawning as that between rich and poor.• Tom Kibasi is a writer and researcher on politics and economicsThe chancellor said he would do whatever it takes to respond to the Covid-19 outbreak, and has set aside a £5bn emergency package to help the NHS. The urgency this shows on coronavirus is welcome. The tragedy is that it doesn’t show the same urgency about an even bigger crisis in the making. The recent floods are a sobering reminder that climate change is here and it will have a devastating impact on people’s homes, livelihoods and communities. In the year that the government is hosting the 26th UN climate change conference of the parties (COP26), this should have been a climate budget. While more capital investment was welcome, not enough of this was directed at the infrastructure to get to a zero-carbon economy. We needed more investment directed into low-carbon public transport, home insulation, heating and reforestation. Instead we got £1bn new investment in green transport solutions and £1bn extra a year in flood defences. This pales in comparison to the £27bn investment in roads and the continued fuel-duty freeze – indicating the government still doesn’t get it.Nor was there a clear plan for how we would help communities across the country manage the transition that must come in a way that is just and fair. If the government is serious about levelling up, it needs to take this head on. Of the 4m UK jobs in sectors that are most vulnerable to the transition, the highest densities are across councils in the north-west, Yorkshire and the Humber and the Midlands. The government needed to set out a plan for how it would direct resources and give powers to local areas to develop local industrial strategies. But there was no mention of this in the budget. We’ve seen what the government can do in an emergency. We need the same focus, commitment and investment in response to the climate emergency. Let’s hope the Treasury’s net-zero review later this year delivers.• Miatta Fahnbulleh is chief executive of the New Economics Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3785a11bbbf6f41acf60903e6393135000896cf0/0_21_4226_2536/master/4226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7746b747ec723b930fa974b1a20c3bd7","title":"rishi sunak budget tories british politics","story":"On 11 March 1952, Rab Butler unveiled the first Conservative budget since the second world war. It was also the first Tory budget since Labour’s creation of the National Health Service. It marked a political turning point for the Tory party. In that budget, not only did Butler become the first and last Tory chancellor of the postwar era to raise the basic rate of income tax – he also began the Tory party’s steady accommodation with key aspects of Labour’s postwar settlement, which lasted until Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.Rishi Sunak did not raise taxes on Wednesday. But the about-turn on public borrowing was almost as spectacular. For a Tory chancellor to say, as Sunak did, that “investment and higher growth mean more jobs and higher wages” is a U-turn. The burying of austerity (though not yet of its effects) is decisive. The role of the state was central to everything. Sunak said enough to suggest that his 2020 budget may even be a political turning point on a par with Butler’s, if it is carried through.Like Butler’s, Sunak’s budget marks the beginning of an end to an era. Like his, it signals an accommodation with the expanded role of government, and suggests a significant change of ideological direction for the Tory party. The 2020 budget may redraw the terms of British party politics more significantly than any budget in a generation. It is an immense intellectual and political challenge to the post-Corbyn Labour party.During his speech, Sunak turned to his predecessor, Sajid Javid, sitting on the backbenches. This budget, said Sunak, will get the job done on Javid’s support for further education. It was a curiously restrained and specific piece of homage – and with good reason. Javid would not have delivered most of this budget. He is more of an apostle of austerity than Sunak, more of a small-state man. Sunak has delivered the bigger-state, fiscally unshackled budget that Boris Johnson demanded in the wake of the 2019 election, and that Javid would have struggled with. We saw on Wednesday the real underlying reason why Javid was forced out last month.Until this week, it had seemed as though events might conspire to blunt the change of direction that Sunak announced. And the budget was certainly dominated by the health emergency. The first third of Sunak’s speech dealt with little else. He pledged £30bn upfront on the NHS and on measures to protect businesses and workers. What a contrast a century makes. Anticipating an epidemic-dominated budget, I dug back into Hansard this week to read Neville Chamberlain’s 1919 budget speech, given at the height of the Spanish flu epidemic that killed nearly 230,000 Britons. Influenza got one extremely oblique mention. There wasn’t even a health minister then, never mind a health service. It was another country.Yet while the coronavirus measures will grab the headlines, it’s the investment in infrastructure that marks this budget as different from those that went before. An extra £175bn over five years, claimed as the biggest fiscal boost in 30 years, is serious new money. Significantly both Javid, in a Times interview, and Philip Hammond, in a Today programme interview, had lobbied publicly for fiscal caution in the run-up to the budget. Both former chancellors were ignored by Sunak. Javid’s fiscal rules will be formally “reviewed” over the next six months. The reality is that the rules are dead. The Treasury green book, basis for the calculation of previous public spending, is to be reviewed too. Austerity as a way of economic life is over.Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to pretend that the Johnson Tory party is somehow finding its way back to the political tradition embodied by Butler, who gave his name – along with Labour’s Hugh Gaitskell – to a centrist Keynesian era in British public policy in the 1950s and 1960s. Times have changed. Politicians, let alone different generations of politicians, never step into the same river twice. Thatcher’s counter-revolution against Butskellism changed the game for ever.Yet this feels, even so, to be a significant turn of the tiller in the Tory party’s slow and uncertain journey away from Thatcherism. Thatcher successfully banished the Butler consensus towards tax-and-spend and the role of the state in economic and social policy. David Cameron continued much of the economic thinking of Thatcher but jettisoned most of her social illiberalism. Theresa May hinted at a more social market approach to economic policy but was unable to deliver it. Johnson has now carried his own social market instincts into action.Yet he has no more converted the Tory party en masse to a pristine and coherent new form of social market economic thinking than Thatcher instantly succeeded in converting it to her ideology of possessive inidualism. Part of Johnson’s problem here is that he himself remains uncertain about what, other than his own success, he really believes in.The Tory party itself also remains a very variegated organism. It has fractures between the primacy of economic interests and those of nationalism, between nostalgia and future focus, between government activism and anti-state inidualism, and between conservatism and liberalism, as well as over post-Brexit Britain’s place in Europe and the world. Its leader is a mix of much of the above.But Johnson is moving the Tory party back on to the territory of government activism nonetheless. It is now lazier than ever to dismiss the Tories as mere neoliberals, compulsive austerians or even as the same old, same old – a big challenge for Labour. Something new is emerging in the Tory party. This important budget is proof that it has the upper hand. Call it, perhaps, Johnsonism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd998c03eaf8e07d5cff25ef13e2a92d2c1ca2f/0_0_941_570/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b08a276f0bf580df9f1f82b9d14bb3b0 1370w","title":"coronavirus complete shutdown uk universities impossible","story":"Vice-chancellors say thousands of students will have nowhere to go if campuses closeUniversity vice-chancellors have told the government they cannot completely shut down if the coronavirus outbreak worsens because thousands of students would be left with nowhere to go.The higher education regulator for England, the Office for Students (OfS), wrote to all universities on Monday, requesting ongoing information on the number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus on campus, as well as details of how institutions are responding to them.It is understood that any decisions about whether to instruct universities to close would be taken by the Department for Education (DfE). A spokesperson for the OfS said universities should “continue to follow advice from DfE and Public Health England”.However, vice-chancellors cautioned that the makeup of universities made their complete shutdown impossible.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Prof Steve West, the vice-chancellor of the University of the West of England (UWE) in Bristol, said: “My bottom line back to government has been that they can’t treat universities like big schools because we aren’t. I’ve got 4,500 students living on campus: some of them are care leavers or estranged from their families and many are international students. We can’t just shut down as they would have nowhere to go.”The vice-chancellor of a university in the elite Russell Group, who asked not to be named, agreed, saying: “We couldn’t fully close. What do you do with thousands of international students who can’t go home?”The vice-chancellor said their university would provide free accommodation for international students who were stranded, even if the government told them to shut.UWE has set up an emergency helpline for worried students and parents. West said: “We would operate something like a Christmas shutdown. The things you can shut down you do, such as lectures and sports. But you also have to provide vital support services for the students still here, including security, catering, wellbeing support and emergency phone lines.”He added that universities may need to mobilise students who are training as nurses, doctors and other health professionals to help bolster voverstretched NHS services. “We need the flexibility to do that, and to support those students,” said West.Harvard University in the US told students on Tuesday that they must move out of their houses and student residences by no later than Sunday and that all classes would be conducted online after the spring holiday, in an attempt to contain the spread of the infection. No cases have yet been detected at the university. Oxford University said it would remain open despite a second student testing positive for coronavirus. In a statement it said: “Public Health England has advised the university that the risk to other students and staff is very low and that university and college activities can continue as normal.”Simon Marginson, a professor of higher education at Oxford, said the volume of people in universities represented a real challenge to containment: “Only transport and inner urban streets clearly exceed the level of people-traffic that we can see in large universities. The end of term cannot come too soon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fa3cc382d1697dfe68d491328203079c5b726c3/0_266_4144_2486/master/4144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74bc4f4120b1f115151f878ce2b61426","title":"polar ice caps melting six times faster than in 1990s","story":"Losses of ice from Greenland and Antarctica are tracking the worst-case climate scenario, scientists warnThe polar ice caps are melting six times faster than in the 1990s, according to the most complete analysis to date.The ice loss from Greenland and Antarctica is tracking the worst-case climate warming scenario set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), scientists say. Without rapid cuts to carbon emissions the analysis indicates there could be a rise in sea levels that would leave 400 million people exposed to coastal flooding each year by the end of the century.Rising sea levels are the one of the most damaging long-term impacts of the climate crisis, and the contribution of Greenland and Antarctica is accelerating. The new analysis updates and combines recent studies of the ice masses and predicts that 2019 will prove to have been a record-breaking year when the most recent data is processed.The previous peak year for Greenland and Antarctic ice melting was 2010, after a natural climate cycle led to a run of very hot summers. But the Arctic heatwave of 2019 means it is nearly certain that more ice was lost last year.The IPCC’s most recent mid-range prediction for global sea level rise in 2100 is 53cm. But the new analysis suggests that if current trends continue the oceans will rise by an additional 17cm.“Every centimetre of sea level rise leads to coastal flooding and coastal erosion, disrupting people’s lives around the planet,” said Prof Andrew Shepherd, of the University of Leeds. He said the extra 17cm would mean the number of exposed to coastal flooding each year rising from 360 million to 400 million. “These are not unlikely events with small impacts,” he said. “They are already under way and will be devastating for coastal communities.”Erik Ivins, of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in California, who led the assessment with Shepherd, said the lost ice was a clear sign of global heating. “The satellite measurements provide prima facie, rather irrefutable, evidence,” he said.Almost all the ice loss from Antarctica and half of that from Greenland arose from warming oceans melting the glaciers that flow from the ice caps. This causes glacial flow to speed up, dumping more icebergs into the ocean. The remainder of Greenland’s ice losses are caused by hotter air temperatures that melt the surface of the ice sheet.The combined analysis was carried out by a team of 89 scientists from 50 international organisations, who combined the findings of 26 ice surveys. It included data from 11 satellite missions that tracked the ice sheets’ changing volume, speed of flow and mass.About a third of the total sea level rise now comes from Greenland and Antarctic ice loss. Just under half comes from the thermal expansion of warming ocean water and a fifth from other smaller glaciers. But the latter sources are not accelerating, unlike in Greenland and Antarctica.Shepherd said the ice caps had been slow to respond to human-caused global heating. Greenland and especially Antarctica were quite stable at the start of the 1990s despite decades of a warming climate.The IPCC is in the process of producing a new global climate report and its lead author, Prof Guðfinna Aðalgeirsdóttir, of the University of Iceland, said: “The reconciled estimate of Greenland and Antarctic ice loss is timely.”She said she also saw increased losses from Iceland’s ice caps last year. “Summer 2019 was very warm in this region.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e94cc56fe9e933654e5480db80402861cbd7b99/2_0_6247_3750/master/6247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc9e525915918ea5b63f5331247e4965","title":"goth princess how the new it dress won over kate and everyone else","story":"The pretty but slightly perplexing dress is a hit with celebrities and royalty alike. Here’s why it is so popularAs our esteemed readers know, we at the  fashion desk do not make a habit of blanket coverage every time a duchess wears a dress to a thing. There are issues that demand rolling coverage in the news right now, and common sense suggests that Kate’s decision to wear, say, a tweed suit versus a wool coatdress on a given day’s charity visit probably isn’t one of those issues. But when she wore a sparkling green Vampire’s Wife dress, with that label’s distinctively dramatic emo-mermaid silhouette and frilled bracelet-length sleeves, it was a genuine moment. Every fashion-based WhatsApp group started blinking in unison the dress was headline news on Vogue soon after.Accessorised with a pint of Guinness during the first stop on the Cambridges’ tour of Ireland, this was a coronation. Not for Kate – for the dress. It was the moment that the Vampire’s Wife dress became an official It dress. Not since Cameron Diaz and Scarlett Johansson simultaneously swooped on Roland Mouret’s Galaxy dress in 2005 has one dress been so ubiquitous. After a lengthy under-the-radar campaign of red-carpet appearances, the Falconetti, which costs £1,595, has branched out from its indie heartland to become a bona fide mainstream hit. Back in 2018, Rachel Weisz wore a floor-length, deepest aubergine version to the Baftas, Margot Robbie wore the same in crimson to a wedding in Australia and Jennifer Aniston chose an identical frock for a Jimmy Kimmel appearance. Last year, Kate Moss appeared in a Vampire’s Wife campaign modelling a shorter version, the Mayhem, while Princess Beatrice wore the Falconetti to Ellie Goulding’s wedding. This dress has crossed every ide: from London to LA, from music to fashion, and from alternative to establishment.The Vampire’s Wife herself is the designer. The ex-model Susie Cave, 53, still has the milkmaid skin and Beetlejuice hair that made her a legendary beauty to whom Prince used to send red roses whenever he was in London. She launched her fashion label in 2014 with a name referencing her husband, the musician Nick Cave. Florence Welch, a devoted fan, has described the signature dress as “making you look like you are practising witchcraft in a very romantic cult”. The fabric is grand – corded dark velvet, or metallic silk chiffon in sweetie-wrapper bright – and the neckline is high and modest. The torso is body-skimming – but not tight – and ends in a seam positioned just above the natural waist. This simple shape is set off by narrow sleeves set on a posture-enhancing high armhole that flounce at the shoulder and waist. The skirt is softly gathered. The classic hemline is below the knee, although there is a short option beloved by Alexa Chung.The Vampire’s Wife phenomenon is remarkable for two reasons. First, famous women do not on the whole want to be seen in the same dress as everyone else, which means it takes a lot for a dress to overthrow the desire to look unique. Second, this dress is not an obvious choice. It is poetry, not pop. The elite few dresses that have enjoyed this degree of success have tended to be beloved for their figure-flattering properties. Mouret’s Galaxy dress, with its internal “power mesh” lining, was a double whammy of internal structure to suction and hold, with external styling that flattered (that elongating back zip) and added an air of sophistication (those origami-like folds at the neckline). Stella McCartney’s Octavia dress, which was everywhere in 2011 – Liv Tyler wore it, and Kate Winslet had it in two different colourways – used optical-illusion panels that functioned as a kind of hourglass-shaped filter over the body.The Vampire’s Wife is different. The shape modestly covers the upper arms and thighs, but the silhouette is cut to work best on a narrow torso and flat stomach. (It is forgiving of age, however, because it covers a lot of skin.) This dress takes the wholesome, milk-fed aesthetic of the prairie dress – and its ubiquitous high-street offshoot, the midi-length ditsy floral dress that has a ruffle at the hem and is probably being worn by someone in your office or railway carriage right now, probably with flat white trainers or ankle boots – and gives it a cheekboned, hungry kind of glamour. Wearing a Vampire’s Wife dress is an elevated kind of a power move: not only are you showing (to those who know) that you have the body to look good in this dress, you are also signalling that you are sufficiently sophisticated in your thinking and messaging to be low-key about showing off.The story of the Vampire’s Wife label is an emotional one. The label launched in 2014 with a broad-based bohemian aesthetic that took in pastel-toned full skirts, silk blouses, cashmere cardigans and Liberty-print tailoring. Then in July 2015, Susie and Nick’s 15-year-old son, Arthur, fell to his death in a tragic accident close to the Brighton family home, and any thoughts of fashion disappeared from Susie’s universe. But three months later, prompted by friends trying to distract her from her grief on the pretext of needing dresses made, she found her way back to her design studio. “To be honest, work is what has saved me,” she told Vogue in 2017. It was during this highly charged time that she narrowed focus, distilling the aesthetic to its essence and hitting on the very particular silhouette with which it has become synonymous. This is a party dress that has an air of melancholy. It is a Disney princess dress for goths, a dancefloor dress for the era of Billie Eilish. It speaks not just of fashion sophistication, but of emotional sophistication.This is a dress that speaks volumes. It is pretty, but it is slightly perplexing. And it is set to be everywhere in 2020: the most recent sighting was on Jodie Comer, while filming Killing Eve season three. The Duchess of Cambridge and Villanelle is about as strong a ticket as it gets. A dress that can unite those two is nothing short of magic. This spring, the Vampire’s Wife will have its moment in the sun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7863867c40c8715a756d7fbd08c8e33bc5ac6ffb/0_135_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=200e4db6a1c4b4a5d429b0e99b49ca7c","title":"yas kweens the political importance of being fabulous","story":"From Cheer to Christopher John Rogers, the term has come to define survival in the face of white privilegeIn the first episode of Pose – the hit drama about the 80s ballroom drag scene that gave birth to vogueing – a group from the House of Abundance break into a museum exhibition of Elizabethan-era clothes. They strip the mannequins, stuff the corsets and ruffs into shiny black bin bags, then escape through a smashed window to the ball competition. “The category is Bring it like Royalty,” says the MC, Billy Porter as the gang walk and pose in their Renaissance era garments. They win the competition, but their victory is about not only looking great whatever the cost, but also about breaking with convention, law and history.In Cheer, Netflix’s docudrama about a competitive cheerleading squad, the breakout stars are Jerry Harris and La’Darius Marshall. Unapologetically exuberant, the black, gay teenagers in Republican-supporting, gun-toting Navarro, Texas, should stick out like sore, if deeply fabulous, thumbs. Yet Cheer becomes a story of how they survived grief (the premature death of Jerry’s mum and La’Darius’s suicide attempt) and accepted themselves. In both shows, as black and Latino members of the LGBTQI community, these characters are outside mainstream society and so have created their own. In this world “being fabulous” is not just the defining quality, but acts as a challenge to the status quo and (white, entitled, birthright) privilege.The concept of fabulousness is said to have begun in the drag subculture and with Crystal LaBeija, who is seen as the founder of ballroom’s “house” culture (alternative families for members of the LGBTQI community who have been kicked out of their homes). Pepper LaBeija, from Crystal’s house, was featured in Jennie Livingston’s 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning which brought ballroom culture to a wider audience.It was in this film that many first heard the words that make up the lexicon of fabulousness. Words such as “work!”, “fierce”, “gagging”, “yaaaaas”, “slay” and phrases such as “giving me life” and “serving a look”. Although TV shows such as Absolutely Fabulous, Sex and the City and America’s Next Top Model brought these phrases and concepts into people’s homes, it was RuPaul’s Drag Race (now in its 12th season) that truly bought the concept of fabulousness into the mainstream.Jinkx Monsoon, who won the fifth season of Drag Race, says both drag and fabulousness are about creating your own destiny. “We’re born into this world, and told from day one who we’re supposed to be,” she says. “We’re told at a very early age that we’re expected to behave, dress, and think certain ways – all because of what is between our legs. Drag is casting all of that off, and deciding for yourself who you want to be.”But the concept of “fabulousness” is also, says Madison Moore, the author of Fabulous: The Rise of the Beautiful Eccentric, a lifeline for people who belong to more than one disempowered or persecuted social group and therefore face intersecting prejudices. “Fabulousness is about the risk of stretching out and expanding when you have been told you don’t deserve to exist.”In his book, Moore sets out four traits that define fabulousness: firstly, it does not take a lot of money secondly it requires a high level of creativity thirdly it is dangerous, political, confrontational, risky and largely (but not exclusively) practised by queer or  transgender people of colour and other marginalised groups. Finally it is about “making a spectacle of yourself because your body is constantly suppressed and undervalued”.Because of this, fabulousness is not to be confused with being camp – because it is inherently political. Susan Sontag in her influential 1964 essay Notes on Camp (the inspiration for the theme of the 2019 Met Gala), defined camp as an aesthetic sensibility devoid of any deeper meaning. But Moore points out that for marginalised people, “there’s no such thing as style for style’s sake. Fabulous people are taking the risk of embracing spectacle when it may perhaps be easier, though no less toxic, to normalise. This is very different from how camp is typically discussed.”In 2020, the concept of “fabulousness” is everywhere: in Lil Nas X’s mashing up of neon disco colours with cowboy style or each time Pose’s Billy Porter wears a traditionally non-masculine outfit on the red carpet. Both style statements challenge the white, cis-gendered status quo.Yet, while mainstream culture has absorbed elements of black culture, such as the adoption of the fabulous lexicon into everyday conversation (“yassss kween”) the outsider status has not disappeared. “Being a black body, a black queer body, a black trans body, a gender nonconforming black body in public space is always vulnerable,” says Moore. “You can’t go shopping while black. You can’t go swimming while black. You can’t enter your dorm room while black. You can’t exist in your own home while black. You can’t drive in your car with a white girl while black. You can’t buy designer clothes while black. You can’t wear a hoodie while black. The list continues.”The models stopped dramatically at the end of the runway pausing for the endless clicks of photographers. They strutted in a knowing parody of fashion cliches. “Our shows are filled with a ton of emotion and energy so we encourage the models to feel themselves and the fantasy when they get on the runway,” Rogers tells me after the show. “It’s really about their personal attitudes and moods coming through.”For the designer, his shows are an expression of “encouraging people to take up space and be the most themselves.” Does he think it is important to express fabulousness in the current climate of political isiveness? “Absolutely,” he says “There’s so much vitriol and pessimism in the air towards iniduals who don’t fit certain moulds, so it’s nice to combat that with true expressions of self, in whatever form that takes. The most effective, in some instances, is radical, boisterous personal style.”Pat Boguslawski, the movement coach who choreographed the model Leon Dame’s strutting, angular walk, which went viral at the SS20 Maison Margiela show, says he was inspired to bring iniduality back to the runway. “A fashion show is not just about mannequins and watching the clothes, it’s about creating a show. So we hire dancers, have amazing lighting and great music. I think a fashion show should be a show.” For him, Dame’s walk was an expression of his iniduality. “As a movement director I’m creating something based on (a person’s) character, on who they are.”Being “who they are” is a key narrative element of Pose. Angelica Ross, who played the spiky Candy, says the show is important on multiple levels. “To quote (Pose producer and trans activist) Janet Mock: ‘We have to say these things cause no one else will.’ Pose told a story that no one else wanted to tell as evident by the many ‘nos’ that (creator) Steven Canals received when initially pitching the project. It’s not only important that Pose told our stories, but told them right by including folks from the (LGBTQI) community at all levels of production.”Fabulousness is a much needed state of mind in the current climate. As Ross says: “Being fabulous means feeling free to be yourself. It’s not fabulous if it’s fake.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c3712de1a03ca0b3da6e24b0c51561c96f657f/184_531_2256_1353/2256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77fc3231acded90398dc5c678b15ccd","title":"the seventh seal to the exorcist max von sydow a life in pictures","story":"Swedish actor Max von Sydow has died at the age of 90.

They’ve even inspired poetry, of a sort: “Boxty on the griddle, boxty in the pan if you can’t make boxty, you’ll never get a man” – though, frankly, I wouldn’t be in rush to share mine with anyone, let alone someone too lazy to make their own.As with many traditional recipes from these islands, from Irish stew to cullen skink, boxty should be made with floury, sometimes known as mealy, potatoes – the sort that explode into billowing clouds of mash, rather than melt obediently into silky-smooth pommes puree. Waxy potatoes retain their shape and their texture too well, and turn this into something more like a rösti starchier kinds give a lighter, fluffier result.Kerrs pink and golden wonder are ideal, though the more widely available Roosters will also work well, and even all-rounders such as maris piper, desiree and king edward will be fine just avoid anything sold as a salad potato.Darina Allen, who in her book Irish Traditional Cooking includes a recipe given to her by one Granny Toye of Clones, Co. Monaghan, which instructs readers to squeeze the water out of the potatoes before use, and let it sit for 20 minutes until the starch sinks to the bottom. This can then be stirred back into the dry potatoes as a binder, and the liquid discarded, making her boxty the crispest of them all.(The much-loved domestic science textbook All in the Cooking, first published in 1946, calls for cooked potatoes alone, though it is labelled as “potato cakes” rather than boxty specifically. Nevetheless, I give it a try, and can confirm that fried potato is delicious in all forms, especially when a lot of butter is also involved.)Cooked potato gives the boxty a smoother, softer texture, helping to glue the strands together so you need less flour. That said, it does rely on having some to hand – a good thing if there’s a box of leftover mash reproaching you from the fridge (Skehan observes you can also use leftover colcannon, or presumably champ), but you can make very nice boxty without, too.Toyes’ recipe is the only one not to involve any extra fat, apart from that in which the boxty are cooked. All in the Cooking adds melted butter, or margarine Henry uses tangy buttermilk, and Rachel Allen and McKenna eggs. The latter also loosens her batter with milk the former single cream, explaining: “This is my husband Isaac’s take on boxty – he uses cream and not too much flour so they’re good and rich”.They are indeed – in fact, both Rachel Allen and McKenna’s recipes are almost halfway to Spanish omelettes: pieces of potato suspended in a kind of custard, and lovely they are, too. I’m taken by the simple approach of Granny Toyes, however fewer ingredients make for an intensely potatoey flavour. Call me decadent, but I can’t resist adding a splash of Henry’s buttermilk – the creamy acidity works so well with potatoes, though if you don’t have it, don’t worry.Toyes uses a bare handful of flour – just enough to stick the potato strands together – while Luard’s flour-heavy formula produces something more like a true bread (a good way to stretch potatoes a little further, if necessary).McKenna and Henry both add raising agents, but with so little flour in my recipe, I don’t think that will make much difference.Luard is the only one to bake her boxty, producing a pleasingly chewy, moist flat loaf with a distinct potato flavour. Everyone else fries them on a griddle butter is better than oil for flavour, though good lard or dripping would also be delicious if such things happen to be available.Wash the potatoes, coarsely grate them into a clean tea towel or muslin, then wring out as much liquid as possible into a bowl (a glass one will make life easier). Leave this to sit undisturbed for about 20 minutes, and in the meantime spread out the potatoes to dry.Carefully pour off the liquid from the bowl, retaining the white, starchy powder that’s collected on the bottom, then add the potatoes, salt and buttermilk to the bowl. Stir in enough flour that the potatoes stick together in loose clumps (you may not need it all).Heat the butter in a heavy-based frying pan about 20cm in diameter over a medium heat. When foaming, add the potato mixture and pat it down to fill the pan. Turn the heat down low and cook for about 15 minutes.Gently loosen the edges of the boxty, flip it on to a plate or board, then slide it back into the pan cooked side up, adding a little more butter first if the pan looks dry. Cook for another 15 minutes, until golden on both sides. Cut into quarters to serve.• Boxty, potato farls or tattie scones: what’s your favourite sort of potato bread, and how do you like to eat it?

Liverpool knew that it was a possibility, however much they controlled this tumultuous Champions League tie, however much they dominated in terms of possession and chances. While the margins remained slim, it could happen.It almost came at the end of normal time when Trent Alexander-Arnold conceded a needless free-kick – to Jürgen Klopp’s immense irritation – and the unmarked Saúl Ñíguez headed Renan Lodi’s delivery past Adrián. The Atlético celebrations ignited like a firecracker only to fade upon the sight of a flag for offside against Saúl.Liverpool ought to have won this game several times over. They attacked in waves, battering Atlético, testing their resilience to the limit. The most influential player on the pitch was the visiting goalkeeper, Jan Oblak, who made a string of excellent saves. Klopp’s team also blew fistfuls of chances, none more gilt-edged than the 67th-minute header that Andy Robertson crashed against the crossbar when gloriously placed.Liverpool had led through Gini Wijnaldum’s header at the end of the first half of normal time and, early in the extra period, they finally got the goal that put them in front on aggregate. Wijnaldum was the creator, powered up the right side to cross for Roberto Firmino, whose header hit the inside of the post. When the ball rebounded to him, he steered it into the other corner.Job done? Not at all. Beware the Atlético sucker punch. It came when Adrián accepted a backpass from Alexander-Arnold and shanked his clearance low and straight to João Felix, who moved it straight to the substitute, Marcos Llorente.The midfielder, who joined last summer from Real Madrid, is not noted for his goalscoring prowess but nobody would have known it. He took one touch to set himself before banging low into the bottom corner. Adrián was extremely slow to get across.Llorente was not finished. At the end of the first period of extra time, he took a pass from another substitute, Álvaro Morata, as Atlético broke and, with Liverpool players backing off, he repeated the trick. Touch, shot, goal. Again, Adrián was nowhere near to the shot and it was easy to imagine that Oblak or, more pertinently, Alisson – Liverpool’s injured No 1 – would have done better. Liverpool were broken and Morata rubbed salt into their wounds by running through at the very end to score a third for Atlético on the night.And so Liverpool experienced a home reverse for the first time in 18 months. They tasted a European knock-out tie defeat under Klopp for the first time. And, most gallingly, they felt their grip loosen on the Champions League trophy they won last May. They are set to secure a first league title since 1990 in the coming days or weeks and, in time, that will feel like the biggest deal of a phenomenal season. Here, there was only frustration.\\Klopp’s preference of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Fabinho in the starting midfield had reflected his determination to get onto the front foot and it really was a beautifully balanced tie at kick-off because everybody knew that Atlético had the ability to threaten the away goal. It took them just 14 seconds to demonstrate how they might get it, with João Felix playing in Diego Costa, who dragged wide from an angle on the right. They would regularly look for that slide-rule pass in behind the Liverpool defence.Atlético set up in their usual 4-4-2, with Felix working up front with Costa, and their midfielders clogging up the centre. They did not want to press high at the outset rather they were happy for Liverpool to come to them with the ball. The question they posed was simple and predictable: can you break us down?Liverpool had to keep the back door bolted or, to quote Klopp, “protect like never before in our life” – as they did against Barcelona here last season. But the onus was plainly on them to make the game in an attacking sense and they built up gradually to Wijnaldum’s goal which levelled the tie on aggregate just before half-time.Wijnaldum had an early headed sighter and Oblak was extended more and more as the first-half wore on. The Atlético goalkeeper saved smartly from Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sadio Mané while he showed good reactions to beat away an Alexander-Arnold cross that came through a crowd. In between times, Mané saw a header blocked by Lodi.Liverpool had been incensed by perceived Atlético gamesmanship in the first leg and there were moments once again when they felt that their opponents went to ground too easily. Felix was one offender and Jordan Henderson felt that he had reason to reproach Ángel Correa, too. Passions swirled and Alexander-Arnold enjoyed putting a little extra into a shuddering challenge on Felix.Atlético created little before the interval – Felipe did glance wide at the near post from a Koke corner – and Liverpool merited the breakthrough goal, which followed Mohamed Salah’s pass to Oxlade-Chamberlain and an excellent cross dug out from him towards the byline. Wijnaldum held his run by the penalty spot and he summoned tremendous power and accuracy in his header, which bounced down and seemed to pick up speed off the turf on its way past Oblak.Atlético dug in as previous Diego Simeone vintages have done and, while Oblak continued to press his claim as Europe’s No 1 shot-stopper, it was possible to feel that anything could happen. Oblak’s save to keep out a low Oxlade-Chamberlain effort from distance on 54 minutes, snaking out a long arm to tip away, was of the highest order, while his presence seemed to spook Firmino at the far post following a whipped Alexander-Arnold delivery.Liverpool were in control but Atlético knew that it might take only one chance on the break to put themselves in control. Felix did work Adrián and the goalkeeper had to be brave to reach the loose ball ahead of Correa. Klopp’s team pressed on and only Robertson knows how he did not score the second in the 67th minute after Salah’s deflected shot looped up to him. His header came back off the crossbar when he appeared ready to celebrate.There was more. Oblak kept out an Alexander-Arnold rocket, Robertson shot wastefully, Mané was high with an overhead kick and Salah shot off-target. Saúl thought he had won it in normal time, but there was to be no denying Atlético in the extra period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa395f93bd9f7454d4eadf24d0aa55ca7d30dd72/0_178_4728_2836/master/4728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188227e9f83ac5840b1d2349d69cd877","title":"paris saint germain borussia dortmund champions league last 16 second leg match report","story":"Paris Saint-Germain beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in a Champions League last-16 second leg to reach the quarter-finals 3-2 on aggregate.

Dortmund finished with 10 men after Emre Can was sent off in the dying minutes for a clash with Neymar.PSG made it past the last 16 after painful exits at the same stage in the last two years. They let slip a 4-0 advantage in a 6-5 aggregate defeat by Barcelona in 2017 and lost to Manchester United on away goals after beating the English side 2-0 at Old Trafford 12 months ago.Over 3,000 ultra fans gathered near the Parc des Princes before kickoff after being granted authorisation by the police - demonstrations being considered an exemption to the ban of gatherings of more than 1,000 as French authorities try to contain the coronavirus, which has infected 2,281 people and killed 48.They lit firework and their chants could be overheard in the stadium. “Our only virus is Paris SG,” a banner in the empty arena read.PSG were without captain Thiago Silva, who had not fully recovered from a hamstring injury, while Kylian Mbappé started on the bench after suffering from a sore throat.PSG dominated possession and had the first clear chance when Edinson Cavani’s cross shot from Ángel Di María’s through ball was deflected by keeper Roman Bürki.Neymar put the hosts ahead in the 28th minute as he ed in to head home Di María’s free-kick for his 35th goal in 57 matches, making his presence count after missing the return leg against United through injury last season.Bernat doubled the lead on the stroke of half-time by flicking Sarabia’s attempt past Bürki. PSG pressed high after the break while Erling Braut Haaland, who scored a double in the first leg, never looked likely to add to his 10 Champions League goals this season.Thorgan Hazard and Axel Witsel made way for Julian Brandt and Giovanni Reyna as Dortmund coach Lucien Favre looked to freshen up his attacking line with PSG on the back foot for much of the second half.A brawl erupted two minutes from time after Can fouled Neymar and pushed the Brazilian to the ground.

Morata ran onto a return pass from Llorente, surged into the area and curled a low shot past Adrian at the near post.119 min Alexander-Arnold brattishly shoves over Morata, who gets up and goes head to head with Alexander-Arnold. Both are booked. It’s a slightly undignified end to Liverpool’s reign as European champions, though you can understand why their collective noggin has gone.118 min “Hardly matters does it?” says Des Platt. “Competition is going nowhere except possibly behind closed doors which is meaningless.”With that kind of positive spin, you should be in politics. 117 min Minamino’s cross is headed up in the air by van Dijk and palmed away by Oblak, who is fouled needlessly by Milner in the process. Liverpool’s heads have gone.116 min Van Dijk is playing centre forward now. Origi wins a corner and takes it short to Milner, whose cross is nutted away by Saul.115 min Mane curls well wide from 25 yards. Liverpool have been too impatient since Atletico’s first goal.

I can’t quite believe this is happening.Atletico make a change as well: Gimenez for Correa.A double change for Liverpool: Origi and Fabinho replace Wijnaldum and Henderson. Liverpool could still do this. Two goals in 15 minutes is not beyond them.This is staggering. Liverpool absolutely battered Atletico for 97 minutes. And then Alexander-Arnold passed the ball back to Adrian.105+2 min That second Llorente goal means the tie can no longer go to penalties. Now Liverpool need two goals or they are out. Atletico broke down the right through Morata, who clipped the ball infield to find Llorente 25 yards from goal. He ran at the backpedalling Gomez, moved the ball away from Henderson on the edge of the D and curled another precise right-footed shot that dipped under the e of Adrian. He might have done better with that as well, though I’d like to see it again.What on earth is happening?103 min Alvaro Morata replaces Joao Felix for Atletico.102 min “No Rob it wasn’t going to pens after Liverpool scored their 2nd on the night,” says Niall Fogarty.Fair point. It was all so frantic, from one goal to the next, that I forgot what day it was.101 min Some news from Italy. This match might be the last football we see for a while.100 min Liverpool dust themselves off and go again. Henderson’s chipped cross is headed to the edge of the area, where Salah volleys over.98 min That Llorente goal means the tie can’t go to penalties. As things stand, Atletico are going through on the away goals rule.Alexander-Arnold played the ball back to Adrian, who kicked it straight to Joao Felix 40 yards form goal. He played a simple reverse pass to Llorente on the edge of the area, and he curled a precise low shot into the far corner. Oh my. Adrian might have saved the shot had he not slipped as he tried to move across his line. But the real howler was the clearance to Joao Felix.Atletico have scored after a howler from Adrian! They’re ahead on away goals.This team are just awesome, utterly relentless. Wijnaldum charged down the right and hammered a cross towards Firmno 10 yards from goal. His superb downward header beat the ing Oblak and hit the inside of the far post, but the ball rebounded perfectly for Firmino to cushion a volley into the open net. It’s his first goal at Anfield all season.Roberto Firmino scores at Anfield!92 min: More chances for Liverpool! Wijnaldum’s drive is pushed away by the plunging Oblak, a fine save down to his right. The ball comes back to Wijnaldum, who stands up a cross towards Firmino on the six-yard line, but he can’t quite get over the ball and it skims off his head and away from goal.91 min Peep peep! Atletico begin extra time, having made another change: Vrsaljko on for Trippier, who is presumably knackered, at right back.Despite some ferocious attacking from Liverpool, the tie is going to extra time.

Few mothers in the study often left their infant to “cry it out” until they reached 18 months, she said, and the study did not consider how long parents left their child or whether they found it helpful.“This doesn’t prove that controlled crying is a beneficial thing,” she said. . Nor does the study “talk about how distressing a lot of mothers find it when their baby cries”.Writing in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, researchers from the University of Warwick report how they followed 178 babies and their mothers in the UK from birth to 18 months.Mothers were asked to fill in questionnaires to report how often they left their baby to “cry it out” at several points in time: shortly after birth and at three months, six months and 18 months. They were also asked how often and for how long their child cried at various point in the day as a newborn and at three months and 18 months.At three and 18 months the team explored how sensitive the mother was towards their infant, using video-recorded interactions between the two, and at 18 months it assessed the children’s behavioural development and attachment to their mother.The team found mothers rarely left their baby to cry as newborns, but the practice became more common as the child grew older, with about two-thirds of mothers allowing the infant to cry sometimes or often by 18 months.That, the researchers add, appears to bring benefits, noting that children left to cry a few times as newborns cried for shorter periods at 18 months.The team say the practice seems does not seem to cause harm. It saw no negative impact on the level of attachment between mother and child, the mothers’ sensitivity or the behavioural development of the child at 18 months, the latter assessed through a combination of techniques including a questionnaire completed by the parent, a psychologist’s report and watching the infant play with its mother.“We neither recommend leaving infant to cry out nor responding immediately,” the authors write. Wolke said the findings suggested parents intuitively know how to best to respond to their infant, and both they and the child adapt over time.He also said the research did not mean parents should just ignore a crying infant, particularly early in life.Crying is “the only way of communication of a baby, for example for feeding, safety and things,” he said. So caregivers “should react to the crying, and automatically we do this.” Letting the baby cry for a few minutes may be helpful though, he added, particularly if it is not feeding time. “Then they can learn how to self-soothe themselves,” he said.The study has limitations, including that it relied on reports of crying rather than direct observation. Nor was it able to unpick whether leaving the child to wail is the cause of shorter subsequent crying periods.Wolke said that because of parents’ strong attitudes on the topic, it would not be possible to carry out a randomised control trial to explore the issue.Dr Charlotte Faircloth, an expert on parenting from University College London, said the “cry it out” issue was hotly debated.The new study “will be reassuring for many parents who have used these kinds of approaches with their babies, but as the study authors suggest, more credit should be given to parents in trusting that they will find an approach that suits them and their families,” she said.Stephen Scott, a professor of child health and behaviour at King’s College, said a number of studies had shown that overindulged children can lack resilience and develop difficulties later in life.He also said the latest findings made sense from an evolutionary point of view. “It is very unlikely that in the jungle when we were in our caves and off hunting, that a child left to cry for a bit would then be damaged by it,” he said. “It just wouldn’t make for a very resilient species, and yet we are incredibly resilient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea0787af73fe1d5caea8796eedaeaf47733ba45/0_56_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b7fa96a7ab64ba941cbcec1022f9982","title":"applications bbc top job director general close media figures steer clear","story":"Opportunity to succeed Tony Hall as director general seen by some as ‘poisoned chalice’The window to apply to become the next director general of the BBC is closing, with many leading media executives distancing themselves from a role seen by some as a “poisoned chalice” given the potential for clashes with the government.One prominent person who had been linked to the role said there was little point in applying given the risk that, even if successful, they could be replaced within 18 months. “If they appoint someone the government doesn’t like, the government will appoint a new chairman to sack the director general,” they said.Another leading British media executive pointed out that the outgoing director general, Tony Hall, earned £450,000 a year, substantially lower than chief executive pay in the rest of the UK commercial media market. They said taking a pay cut and dealing with the enormous scrutiny and political pressure that comes with running the public broadcaster would not be offset by the potential prestige of saving the BBC at a delicate moment in its history.Applications were due to close on Wednesday. Whoever takes the role later this year will face ever-reducing budgets an imminent negotiation with the government over a new funding settlement a battle to retain audiences that are drifting to commercial rivals such as Netflix ministers demanding the redeployment of resources outside of London ongoing issues regarding unequal gender pay calls from Conservative MPs for programmes that reflect the views of Brexit voters and the fallout of the decision to make most over-75s pay the licence fee. Any past political statements by candidates will also be expected to come under enormous scrutiny. Potential internal candidates for the job include the BBC commercial chief, Tim Davie, and the corporation’s director of content, Charlotte Moore. In a break with tradition, BBC sources suggested that no leading figure from the corporation’s news operation was putting themselves forward for the role. The director general is also editor-in-chief of the news operation and their attitude towards the department will be key at a time when the corporations’ news output has come under enormous scrutiny amid accusations of bias from all sides of the political ide.There will also be substantial pressure to appoint the first female director general, long after many other leading British media organisations have been led by women. This has led speculation to focus on the former Channel 4 chief creative officer Jay Hunt, currently running Apple’s European television operation, and Jane Turton of All3Media, which owns the independent production companies that make hits including Call the Midwife and Fleabag.Other external executives linked to the job have ruled themselves out of the running, with the ITV chief executive, Carolyn McCall, saying it is “not something I’m considering”. Others such as the Channel 4 chief executive, Alex Mahon, and the Glasgow-based STV chief, Simon Pitts, have said they remain committed to their current jobs.One of the few iniduals happy to be linked to the job is the former chancellor George Osborne, with friends of the Evening Standard editor telling the Financial Times he was interested.A particular concern for candidates is the position of the government-appointed BBC chairman, who runs the corporation’s governing board, which ultimately oversees the work of the director general.The current occupant of the role is David Clementi, whose five-year term in office runs until February 2021. Hall’s decision to quit earlier than expected has enabled Clementi to oversee the appointment of the next director general, giving him substantial sway over the broadcaster’s future in the medium term. But it also means that whoever gets the director general job is likely to find themselves working for a new, unknown, government-appointed chairman shortly after being appointed.This raises the prospect of a repeat of previous incidents of government intervention in the workings of the BBC, such as when Margaret Thatcher’s government, concerned about the BBC’s output, appointed Marmaduke Hussey as chairman in 1986. Within months he had sacked the then director general, Alasdair Milne."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de73a78294eb3da92a6931c2aea32787400e66e5/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a57ef7dc331d0faae31f2b292e0c842","title":"tell us are money struggles making you lonely","story":"We want to find out how people are feeling isolated by their financial woesWe may be bad at talking about money but we are arguably even worse at talking about our difficulties managing it.Research by the Money Advice Service found that half of people in debt did not want to talk to friends and family about it because they didn’t want to worry them.Money struggles can lead to people feeling cut off from others for a range of reasons, but withdrawing into financial loneliness can make it even harder to solve your problems.We want to understand more about how people feel isolated as a result of their financial woes.How has your employment status affected your income?

Including either in a recital is a statement of intent, but playing both in the same evening, as Pierre-Laurent Aimard did, is on another level altogether.Yet juxtaposing them makes a lot of sense, for these craggy, extreme works have much more in common than sheer scale and take-it-or-leave-it difficulty. Ives’s sonata takes its title from the Massachusetts town indelibly linked with American transcendentalism, its four movements named after writers – Emerson, Hawthorne, The Alcotts, Thoreau – who lived there, but it is just as indebted to Beethoven. Not only does it obsess on the opening motif from the Fifth Symphony, but references to the Hammerklavier are regularly woven into its tangled textures as well.Aimard played the Beethoven first. Using the sustaining pedal sparingly, it was a performance of unflinching, sometimes startling clarity, especially in the colossal fugue with which the sonata ends, but it was always more convincing on the tumult than the poetry. The huge Adagio (the longest slow movement Beethoven ever wrote) was never as poised and other-worldly as it can seem in some performances, and the final climax was more clangorous than consoling.In the Concord Sonata it was the rare moments of quiet calm, especially in the second-movement scherzo, that stood out most of all. Aimard kept a cool, controlling head in even the work’s most extreme moments of teeming, tumbling busyness his tireless performance, without the parts for viola and flute in the outer movements that Ives added as options, seemed to link it with the great piano works that followed it in the 20th century, as much as it looked back to Beethoven’s example that inspired it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e668b0b7f2afdd4cb81795a44f6fde7fff6c5f2a/1348_571_2219_1331/master/2219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6498c8a6c8e7ef4fab1495a501f5991a","title":"hadley freeman search uncover family secrets podcast","story":"When Hadley Freeman found an old shoebox full of pictures and documents in the back of a wardrobe, it began a quest to find the real story of her family’s history and her grandmother’s escape to America from the Nazis.

You’d have thought that once the junior health minister Nadine Dorries had announced she had caught it, some members of the government – Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock among them – might have chosen to self-isolate. For everyone else’s safety as much as their own. Other workplaces have shut down for less.But this was Rishi Sunak’s Big Day Out. A chance for the 16-year-old school prefect doubling as chancellor to splash the cash, to show that the “people’s government” really did care for the lower orders every bit as much as it did for the hedge funds that had bankrolled its election victory.So the entire cabinet squeezed themselves along the front bench to cheer him on. Boris and Matt did their best to look really, really well – “There’s nothing wrong with us, guv” – while Psycho Dominic Raab discreetly coughed into his hands. No one passed him a tissue. Or a face mask. Rather they tried not to look as if they had noticed, while slowly edging themselves away. Keep Calm and Carry On. Ish.Sunak began by announcing £30bn of measures to help the country get through the coronavirus epidemic, a serious amount of cash that rather suggested the government believes the situation is going to be a great deal worse than it has up till now been prepared to let on.Everyone thought it best not to mention the fact that the NHS might be in a far better place if the Tories hadn’t cut public services relentlessly for the past 10 years. The UK has fewer than half the intensive care beds of almost every other EU country. Or that people on zero-hours contracts were still vulnerable. Then we are at a new Year Zero where austerity never happened. The mere mention of George Osborne or Philip Hammond is enough to get you disappeared.A wiser chancellor might have cut his losses after the coronavirus announcements. Just explain we were on the verge of a recession even before we had entered a crisis situation, so there were too many unknowns for any sane economist to make any credible future spending plans. So turn this into an emergency budget, with the promise of a follow-up when he had a clearer picture or what he was dealing with. There again, it might just be handy to have the coronavirus to blame when everything else goes tits up. You win some, you win some.In any case, Rishi had another 45 minutes of Noises Off am-dram theatrics to get through. It’s always the politicians with the least charm and charisma who feel obliged to go on the longest. He waved his arms about, told a couple of shit gags and indulged in a bit of call and response. “We got Brexit done,” he squeaked. “What else are we getting done?” “Absolutely everything,” replied the Tory benches, reading from the Boris hymn sheet.And in a way they were. Boris looked thrilled. Priapic, even. There’s nothing he likes more than wholesale spaffing. After a while even the Tory benches got into the swing of things. If this had been a Labour chancellor announcing the very same measures, the Conservative MPs would have been having a full-on Venezuelan Marxist heart attack, but as it was their boy they collapsed with multiple orgasms.There was no end to Rishi’s rabbits. Literally anything anyone had ever wanted, they could have. Hospitals? As many as you like. Trains, planes and automobiles? Go for it. Schools. Houses. Booze. Toys. Things. Stuff. There wasn’t really a plan for any of this, but there sure was the cash. Not just for infrastructure projects but also for day-to-day spending.Sunak had no idea where any of the money was coming from – it sure as hell wasn’t coming from his own pocket, as he intended to hang on to the fortune he’d made at Goldman Sachs – but the £600 health surcharge on every immigrant was a decent start. The rightwingers in his party would be salivating at the prospect of cracking down on a few foreigners. Who said this wasn’t a budget for everyone? All the chancellor knew was there was unlimited cash for everything. Apart from the things there wasn’t cash for.Just about the only Tory not to enjoy the occasion was Sajid Javid. The former chancellor looked thoroughly miserable throughout. This was Sunak stealing all his best lines. Even the ones about sticking to the fiscal rules with a view to ignoring them at a later date. Rishi was on the up – a possible leader in waiting – while the Saj was going nowhere. Having an unexpected fit of conscience suddenly didn’t look like such a good idea after all. He should have dumped his Spads and taken the glory.As usual, Jeremy Corbyn replied for the opposition. Though he may as well not have bothered. He is already three months past his sell-by date and no one in the Commons pays attention to a word he says. Even Corbyn appears to be bored by Corbyn. He made little effort to engage with anything Sunak had said and just read from his prepared script in a morose monotone.There again, almost no one would care much about the budget by the end of the day. Within hours the World Health Organization had declared the coronavirus to be a global pandemic and that many governments had been too slow to act. The UK being a possible case in point.

The team add that the tracks were found in sedimentary rocks thought to be about 170 million years old, which formed from mudflats that once bordered a lagoon.Stegosaurs – hefty, armoured plant-eaters with upright plates running down their backs and a spiked tail – are a major group of dinosaurs, yet Brusatte noted there are few bones or tracks that date from this time anywhere on Earth.The new study, published in the journal Plos One, follows previous finds by the team, including tracks which revealed that as well as huge, long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs known as sauropods, Skye was once home to meat-eating dinosaurs, probably theropods.As with that study, the newly discovered prints were found at Rubha nam Brathairean, or Brothers’ Point, on the east of the island, albeit at two different sites.In addition to the stegosaurus prints the team found other tracks, with about 50 prints discovered in total.“There are some three-toed prints with claw marks that were made by theropods, but there were no sauropod tracks at these sites,” said Brusatte, noting that tracks of the latter were previously found further into what was once the lagoon, suggesting sauropods splashed through shallow water rather than walking on the mudflats.However, some of the newly discovered three-toed prints were larger than others and had stubby toes which, the team suggests, could have been made by another type of dinosaur – plant-eating, bird-hipped creatures called ornithopods, a group that includes duck-billed dinosaurs. But Brusatte said more evidence was needed.“If we find bones of big ornithopods on Skye I think that will be a pretty good sign that some of these tracks were made by ornithopods,” he said.The team say the new findings expand our understanding of the community of dinosaurs that once roamed the Scottish isle.“It would have been overrun with … so many different types of dinosaurs: meat-eaters, plant eaters, big ones, small ones, ones that were running around, ones that were wading in the water, ones that had long necks, ones that had plates on their backs,” said Brusatte. He added that in the middle Jurassic, Skye was not the chilly, windswept environment we know today – it was closer to the equator. “It was an island in the middle of the ever-widening Atlantic with this subtropical, wet, humid, hot climate with rivers draining mountains in the middle of the island, emptying out into the ocean and then beaches and lagoons fringing the coasts – and these places were havens for dinosaurs and for all kinds of other species,” Brusatte said.The team say the latest finds highlight the importance of re-examining well-known areas, noting that one of the sites has been scrutinised by palaeontologists and geologists for decades yet its secrets remained hidden until a storm shifted some boulders.

The man who has seen his colours carried to victory here more often than any owner in the game added four more winners to his lifetime total on Wednesday and yet may still have left the track mulling over the one that got away. McManus has now won 64 races at the Festival but after the odds-on defeat of Defi Du Seuil in the feature event, the Queen Mother Champion Chase is still not among them.But maybe that just adds to the story. McManus has been a constant thread in the Festival narrative for decades, most famously in his early days thanks to some legendary tilts at the betting ring. Huge gambles were landed, often at the expense of the late bookie Freddie Williams, one of the few layers in the ring willing to take McManus on, while the owner also owned a series of Grade One-winning champions, including Istabraq, who took three Champion Hurdles, and Baracouda, twice successful in the Stayers’ Hurdle. There were three winners for the green-and-gold in one afternoon in 2012, including Synchronised, his only winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup.Never before, though, has McManus had a day like Wednesday, which kicked off with the most dramatic success in his colours since Tony McCoy somehow dragged Wichita Lineman past the post on the opening day in 2009. Champ, a 4-1 chance for the RSA Chase, looked a lost cause between the last two fences and briefly hit 700-1 in-running before arriving with a storming run up the hill to win going away.McManus makes fewer excursions to the betting ring these days. With a rumoured wealth of €2bn from currency trading, it might not have quite the same buzz. But Dame De Compagnie, the winner of the Coral Handicap Hurdle, was noticeably strong in the market in a race where the owner had five starters, and finished as if she could sense it to win by two-and-a-quarter lengths.“I would just like to mention a friend of mine, Joe McKenna,” McManus said as he celebrated his 62nd Festival winner. “He’s not here today, he’s been here with me for the last 30-odd years but he is at home at the minute. Just to say, we are thinking of you, Joe, and we will have you back here next year.” Three races later, McManus’s lifetime total had reached 64, as Easysland saw off Tiger Roll, the dual Grand National winner, in the Cross Country Chase before Aramax squeezed home by a length in the Juvenile Handicap Hurdle.The odds on the McManus four-timer worked out at 1,019-1, even without the one that got away. The script for this year’s Champion Chase seemed to be pre-written as just five runners went to post, with Defi Du Seuil priced at 4-11 after Chacun Pour Soi, his main market rival, joined Altior on the sidelines earlier in the day. A first win for the owner in the one feature race to elude him thus far seemed all but guaranteed.But there are no guarantees at the Festival and Defi Du Seuil was beaten a long way from home, after a lifeless display which Philip Hobbs, his trainer, was at a loss to explain. The only consolation, perhaps, is that after a grand total of 64 winners in green and gold at the biggest meeting of the year, it is good that McManus still has something to aim for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90eea4dc350634eaf1807c60c6acd0bbe822bca3/0_249_4408_2645/master/4408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e88897b3eeb4dd44c16f434e800bd321","title":"are electric cars cheaper to maintain and four other common ev questions answered","story":"Motoring journalist Jess Shanahan tackles the questions often asked by drivers thinking of going electric – and finds out EVs are efficient to run, easy to charge, and cost-effectiveIf you’re currently in the market for a new car, chances are you’ll have considered, at least briefly, the possibility of going electric.While even five years ago, the thought of owning an electric vehicle (EV) was pretty radical, increased awareness of the climate crisis combined with ever-improving EV technologies – not to mention talk of cost savings – are resulting in more and more people making the switch.But if you still have some pressing questions and niggling doubts, you’re not alone. We’ve taken five of the most common EV questions to the experts to help you make an informed decision ...Are electric cars cheaper and easier to maintain than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars?In short, yes. An electric motor is much more simple than an ICE, with fewer moving parts. As a result, the battery pack and motor need less maintenance than the equivalent parts in an ICE vehicle.“There’s no oil or oil filter to change, no engine to maintain and fewer parts to wear out, so an EV will be cheaper to service,” explains Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “Some drivers also find they drive more economically as the instrument panel indicates how you are driving and shows you, in real time, the energy being consumed by the battery. This can mean drivers are lighter on the accelerator and brakes, therefore extending the life of brakes and tyres too.”Renault has also adopted an energy recovery braking system: every time the vehicle slows down, part of its kinetic energy is converted into electricity. The battery is recharged when the driver lifts the foot off the accelerator or slightly engages the brake. This helps preserve or even increase your driving range, and of course save you electricity charges.How far can electric cars go?This varies from electric car to electric car, but almost all will do more than 100 miles on a full charge, with most newer models going past 200 miles.Even EVs with smaller battery capacities can be charged quickly, though. Using a rapid charger, just 20-30 minutes of charging will give more than enough juice to complete most everyday journeys.Do electric cars pay road tax?Yes and no … depending on the age and price.All EVs registered prior to April 2017 pay zero vehicle excise duty (VED, often called “road tax”), as it’s all based on tailpipe emissions – and as EVs generate 0 gkm of CO2, they’re exempt.However, the rules around VED changed in April 2017, and a premium tax was introduced. Now, any car over £40,000 when new has to pay an annual supplement (£310-320 a year depending on the model year of the vehicle) for the first five years, regardless of its emissions.Fortunately, it’s possible to bag a brand new EV for far less than the £40,000 threshold. For instance, New Renault ZOEs start at £25,670 – no VED is just one of the reasons it’s the ideal first electric car.Are electric cars automatic?Not exactly. Like automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a clutch or gear stick, but that’s where the comparison stops. Unlike automatic cars, electric cars don’t have a gearbox at all, which results in a smoother ride and nippy acceleration.Confused? Rice explains: “ICE cars need gears as they can only generate powertorque in a narrow band of engine speeds and the gears help keep the engine within those bands. In an electric car, maximum torque is available instantly and at low speeds so there is no need to have multiple gears.”Can I charge my electric car at home?Not only can you charge your electric car at home, it’s the preferred option for most EV owners.When it comes to charging at home, you have two options. By far the most efficient is using a dedicated home-charging point – something Renault provides for free with every retail purchase** of the New Renault ZOE. These are wall-mounted, weather-proof units that you connect to your car to using a dedicated charging cable. It’s best to charge your car at night – when electricity rates are often cheaper – and then top up in smaller bursts throughout the day, if needed.The second home-charging option is to charge your car using a normal three-pin socket. This is a great solution if you’re away from home and need a top-up, but shouldn’t be your only, or primary, charging solution. Charging this way is much slower than using a wall-mounted unit, and gives eight miles of range an hour of charging compared with a 7kW home charger that will give around 30 miles of range an hour, according to WLTP testing*. You can also often top up for free on public networks when you are out and about – look for charging points at supermarkets and public car parks. Rapid DC charging at 50kW available on the New Renault ZOE will give an estimated 90 miles driving range in 30 minutes.Curious to learn more about EVs?

Motoring journalist Maria McCarthy explains why they’re more than just a passing trendThere’s no doubt that this acceleration is in part being driven by increased awareness and fears about the climate crisis. But while we know that EVs are greener than traditional internal combustion engine cars, making the transition from the familiarity of fossil fuel to embracing electric can feel daunting, no matter how urgently you feel the climate emergency. Will vast amounts of number-crunching and spreadsheets be required to work out if an electric car will fit your lifestyle? Might you have to draw on vague memories of what Kws are from long-ago physics lessons? Thankfully, that won’t be necessary.“People often worry that deciding to move over to an electric car will be a chore and involve a lot of research,” says Emily Rice, product manager at Renault Electric Vehicles. “But once they get started, they discover there’s lots of independent, accessible information out there, and the process can be very straightforward.”When electric cars first came on to the market, there was a lot of hand-wringing about “range anxiety” – the fear of the battery running out before you can get to a charging point. But it turns out that unless you embark on epic road trips on a regular basis, range anxiety isn’t a cause for concern. “The New Renault ZOE has a range of up to 245 miles according to WLTP testing*,” explains Rice. “And that’s plenty for most of us.”According to the Department of Transport, the average annual mileage for private cars in 2018 was 7,400 – this works out at just over 20 miles a day, so the New Renault ZOE will easily meet most people’s day-to-day needs.And when you do need to charge your battery, it’s as easy as charging your smartphone. Most electric car drivers charge at home – something made even easier by Renault, which provides a free home charge point for new retail customers purchasing a New Renault ZOE**. Once you set off with a full battery, you rarely need to top up on regular journeys. And if you do run out of juice on the go, there’s no need to panic – the UK now has more EV charging points than petrol stations (almost 10,000 locations now offer public charging points, according to Zap-Map).And best of all, the mileage costs are significantly cheaper. Costs will vary depending on your electricity tariff but, according to the Energy Saving Trust, charging an electric vehicle at home will cost on average 4-6p per mile, and 8-10p if using a public charging point. This compares with 13-16p for a petrol or diesel car.But choosing a car isn’t just about drawing up budgets – it’s about how it feels. And if you’ve never driven an electric car before then it’s time to get behind the wheel. “I find electric cars provide a versatile, relaxing drive,” says Thomas Clifton, electrification and new mobility manager at Renault. “As there’s no gear changes, they’re ideal for navigating city traffic. Then out of town, they handle just as well as a petrol or diesel car on motorways and rural roads. Forget the myth that electric cars are like driving a milk float – they give a smooth, powerful drive with great acceleration.”“If you’re curious about electric cars, then do take one for a test drive,” suggests Rice. “And don’t just try it out in town – take the New Renault ZOE out on a motorway or dual carriageway and let it show you what it can do. I would recommend asking to borrow it over night if you can and see how easily it could fit into your lifestyle.”It’s easy to put off making the switch to electric car ownership until some vague, undefined point in the future – but the truth is, there’s really no need to. If you have any reservations about the costs, charging options or drive, a little research and a test drive will quickly allay your fears. Once motorists take the plunge, they quickly become “electrical evangelists” with zero interest revisiting the dark days of internal combustion engine ownership. The only question is: when will you join them and start reaping the benefits of greener motoring?Curious to learn more about EVs?

The series, which exists along the same lines as Seven Up, took 25 British babies, born at the start of the new millennium, and followed them over several years. Archive footage from the very beginning shows experts suggesting that we were looking at “a better society, a better world for our children”.That was 20 years ago. In a series of rapid-fire news compilations, we see that a lot has happened in the lifetimes of the children and families who signed up (for anyone who watched Russell T Davies’s apocalyptic drama Years and Years, there is a worrying tang of familiarity to the clips). These kids were born before 911, before the financial crisis, before anyone much cared about the EU. The average price of a house when this series began was less than £80,000 fewer than half of people owned mobile phones.The programme-makers make the wise decision to concentrate on three of the children, now in early adulthood, though some of the others appear occasionally, with insights of their own. This episode is also dedicated to participant Parys Lapper, the son of the artist Alison, who died last year. He was, they say, a much-loved member of the Child of Our Time family.Eve, named after the grandmother who died when her own mother was pregnant with her, was born to evangelical Christian parents. She talks of her mother warmly, in the past tense. Her story is one of grief, then in 2009, we see her with her father and sister, setting a balloon loose next to a memorial tree. But she also talks about coming out as gay, and how, at 15, it seemed like the most important thing about her, and how at 20, it is not necessarily what she feels compelled to tell people when she meets them for the first time. She is training to be a midwife now, inspired, perhaps, she thinks, by her mother’s caring manner.Jamie had an idyllic-sounding childhood, which he remembers with clear fondness and affection. He was diagnosed with type one diabetes, and recalls some moments of teenage abandon that served as a wake-up call. But the story threaded through his life is of his parents’ marriage and orce, how good his father was as a dad, and how his father’s affair made him realise how much he would come to value honesty in his own life. He is a chef, and his girlfriend is pregnant. He knows the kind of father he plans to be.The parents take a leading role in the story of Rhianna’s life, too. A sensitive child, she feared breaking the rules to such an extent that her parents took her to see a psychiatrist, who gently pointed out that he recommends the reduction of “family conflict” to most of the parents he sees. Rhianna’s parents eventually separated, and she is now studying psychology, trying to understand where she came from.As a tool of child psychology, the series is able to see how lives have unfolded, at every crucial stage, with the benefit of hindsight, and it does seem to confirm the Philip Larkin edict about what one’s parents can do to you. It is even more effective, though, as a portrait of Britain through two decades. Some of the statistics are alarming, such as the growth of reported depression and anxiety in young people, but some are soothing, too, such as the reduction of stigma around discussing personal problems. Any potential for the mockery of a generation of “snowflakes” is given short shrift here, not pointedly, but by example. These young people are articulate, sensitive and sympathetic, and they are clearly also robust.At first, it struck me as unusual that these young adults now can see their lives in this way, captured and archived. Two of the subjects talk about traumatic parts of their lives and how they suspect they have deliberately forgotten about them. But Child of Our Time has footage of those periods. One of the key developments of the past 20 years, though, is that almost everyone’s life is documented now, thanks to smartphones. Their experience has become everyone’s experience, making its resonance even more profound.

Sandi Toksvig stepped down in January after co-presenting the show for three years.Lucas said in a statement: “I’m chuffed to bits to be joining the most delicious show on television. I can’t wait to break bread with Noel, Prue and Paul and meet the brilliant bakers. And bearing in mind my love of cake, I’ve already ordered some much larger trousers in anticipation. See you in the tent!”Fielding said: “I love Matt. I love his warmth and his comedy and his big joyful smile. I think if we play our cards right we could become the next Chas and Morph.”Paul Hollywood described Lucas as a “fantastic addition to the team”, while his fellow Bake Off judge Prue Leith said: “The combination of Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding! Will we stop laughing and get any filming done?”The show was presented by Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins from 2010 to 2016 when it was broadcast by the BBC. It moved to Channel 4 in a £75m deal after the corporation refused to pay the production company Love Productions £25m a year.The former Bake Off contestants Liam Charles and Nadiya Hussain and the comedian Jo Brand were among the names rumoured to be in contention to take over from Toksvig, who also presents the BBC quiz show QI.Ian Katz, Channel 4’s director of programmes, said: “We’re thrilled that one much-loved national institution is joining another. Matt has everything it takes to be a Great Bake Off presenter: he’s warm, hilarious and loves cake.”Bake Off remains a hugely popular franchise for Channel 4 despite viewing figures falling from a peak in 2015, when 14.5 million people watched the series finale won by Hussain. The last series, won by David Atherton, was plagued by criticism of its increasingly difficult challenges.Toksvig’s final presenting stint, on the spinoff Stand Up to Cancer series, is currently airing.Lucas first came to prominence on the comedy quiz show Shooting Stars and is best known as a co-creator and star of Little Britain alongside David Walliams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb026e15f95eff9446d59cfe6866c67bcd0e29f0/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24a76f7aef487752bb9de08a35bd8965","title":"ranked choice voting us primary elections washington","story":"Americans who vote early may ‘waste’ their vote on candidates who drop out of the race. There’s an easy way to remedy thatAcross the country, millions of voters turned in early ballots for the US presidential primary elections, often voting for candidates no longer in the race on election day.Just yesterday, more than a million Washington voters finally had the chance to weigh in. Unlike other states, which saw long lines and voting machine errors, the state votes by mail and has a highly engaged electorate. As a result, a significant proportion of ballots were returned early, essentially throwing away their vote.Early voting is generally viewed as a good thing by civil rights advocates – it helps avoid errors on election day, and curbs long lines at the precinct. But voting for soon-to-be unviable candidates is not only a frustrating reality for proactive voters, but intrinsically harmful to the democratic process.Fortunately, there is a simple solution: ranked-choice voting (RCV). And it’s one that has the potential to address a host of other problems that plague our electoral system, including negative campaigning and lack of minority representation.Four states – Alaska, Kansas, Wyoming and Hawaii – are already using ranked-choice voting in the current Democratic presidential primaries, and one state, Maine, uses it for state elections and for US Congress and president. New York City also recently adopted ranked-choice voting beginning in 2021. But most of the country has yet to catch on.Under ranked-choice voting, voters rank their favorite candidates in order of preference, and if their first choice is no longer viable, their vote would count towards their next choice. The process would continue until all votes are supporting viable candidates.If ranked-choice voting had been in place in Washington, voters who turned in their ballot early for Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg or Elizabeth Warren could rest assured that their vote would still count towards their next preference rather than being wasted on a candidate who is no longer in the running. And candidates would probably face less pressure to drop out of the race early.But reforming our primary elections is only one benefit.Under the current plurality voting system, candidates benefit from attacking their opponents and highlighting their ideological differences in an effort to appeal to their base. However, in a ranked-choice election, candidates are also campaigning to be voters’ second and third choices.We saw this happen in the 2018 San Francisco mayoral race: two candidates, Mark Leno and Jane Kim, actually campaigned together to fight for shared values as they reached out to voters in a ranked-choice election. In a political field that is often fraught with negativity, this kind of positive campaigning is a welcome change.This same system, meanwhile, can help historically marginalized communities achieve representation in their own cities.“We are trying to ensure that we have a more equitable election system here in Yakima county,” Dulce Gutiérrez, a plaintiff in the case, and one of the few Latinx city council members elected told us. “We believe that there are remedies that can improve the likelihood of representation.”Historically, the remedy has been to move to majority-minority districts that concentrate minority voters in a particular geographic district in order to garner representation. However, such a system is vulnerable to gerrymandering and vote splitting and, perversely, only protects communities of color that live in highly segregated neighborhoods.In Yakima, a switch to ranked-choice voting with multi-member districts would help achieve “proportional representation” and guarantee that roughly every one-third of the residents is able to pick one of the three commissioners. Latino candidates regularly get more than a third of the countywide vote, but historically are unable to win countywide races.Washington state has been a leader in adopting commonsense reforms, like mandating marriage equality or legalizing marijuana, but it is well behind the curve in electoral reforms like ranked-choice voting.We have plenty of real-life examples of ranked-choice voting working for communities. It’s already used in several countries, including Australia, Scotland and New Zealand. It’s also gathering momentum in the United States, where it is used in over 20 jurisdictions.After all, our democracy is at stake.• Mohit Nair is partnerships director of FairVote Washington.• Colin Cole is legislative director and a co-founder of FairVote Washington.

What lessons does it offer for our current health crisis?Plagues – or, to use a more modern term, epidemics of infectious disease – pluck at our most primal fears. We have lived with them for at least 10,000 years, ever since our ancestors took up farming and built the first semi-permanent settlements. And they have always had the upper hand. They know us intimately, preying on our strengths – our sociability, our love of gossip – and turning them into weaknesses. They are always a step ahead, and once they are out, like the genie, we can’t get them back in. All we can do is limit the damage. So here we are again.Because epidemics are frightening, it is hardly surprising that people reach for the worst possible historic comparison. The 1918 influenza pandemic, which has been distilled in the public imagination to a single black-and-white image of bedridden US soldiers, has been hauled out of mothballs to do duty as a template of what we might expect from Covid-19. But is that global human catastrophe, which killed between 50 million and 100 million people – the vast majority in the developing world – and which was largely forgotten for most of the last century, the right comparison to make?It is important to note that the Covid-19 outbreak is not yet officially a pandemic – a global epidemic. Some have accused the World Health Organization (WHO) of doing semantic cartwheels to avoid naming it as one, given the rate at which the disease is spreading, but at the time of writing roughly half of the world’s countries remain Covid-19-free.Should we be comparing Covid-19 to flu at all? The viruses that cause the two diseases belong to different families. Sars-CoV-2 belongs to the coronavirus family, other members of which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China between 2002 and 2004, and of Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which began in Saudi Arabia in 2012.The bottom line, then, is that Covid-19 will almost certainly not turn out to be as bad as the 1918 flu pandemic, but it could still be bad – perhaps on a par with the pandemics of 1957 or 1968. Until a vaccine becomes available – which isn’t likely for at least 18 months – containment is our only hope for slowing its spread.Where containment is concerned, historical comparisons can help, because the techniques don’t change. Quarantine, isolation, masks and handwashing are all time-honoured methods of keeping the sick and the healthy apart, and minimising disease transmission.One lesson governments took from 1918 is that mandatory public health measures tend to be counterproductive. Containment is much more effective if people choose to comply. But for that to happen, they need to be properly informed about the threat they face, and to trust the authorities to act in their collective interest. If either – or both – of these things is missing, containment works less than well. In 1918, most governments were caught unawares by the pandemic – because they had no disease surveillance system in place – and public information campaigns were risible.One of the reasons the 1918 flu came to be known as the “Spanish” flu was because Spain was neutral in the war and didn’t censor its press. Whereas the US, Britain and France – all of which had the flu before Spain – kept it out of the newspapers at first to avoid damaging morale. When they finally acknowledged it, the newspapers issued conflicting public health messages and repeated unfounded rumours – including one that German U-boats beaching in the US had deliberately sown the flu.Germ theory – according to which infectious diseases are caused by microscopic organisms – was also relatively new. Inevitably, people found it easy to revert to more mystical, and more fatalistic, explanations of what was happening. In the deeply pious Spanish city of Zamora, for example, the local bishop defied the health authorities by ordering a novena – evening prayers on nine consecutive days – in honour of Saint Rocco, the patron saint of plague and pestilence. This involved churchgoers lining up to kiss the saint’s relics, around the time that the outbreak peaked. Zamora went on to record the highest flu-related death rate of any city in Spain, and one of the highest in Europe.New York City, on the other hand, experienced one of the lowest death rates. The city’s inhabitants were used to public health interventions by 1918, since local authorities had orchestrated a 20-year campaign against tuberculosis. But some New Yorkers had other ideas: local papers reported on a “black wedding” in Mount Hebron cemetery, where two Jewish strangers were married in an ancient ritual to ward off plague. Meanwhile, in the business community, there was resistance to the health commissioner’s attempts to restrict attendance at places of entertainment. When Charlie Chaplin’s film Shoulder Arms was released in the autumn of 1918, Harold Edel, the manager of the Strand theatre – a cinema on Times Square – praised his customers for their impressive turnout. He died of flu a few weeks later.The world of 2020 is vastly different from 1918. Howard Phillips, a historian of the 1918 flu at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, observes “the relative silence of organised religion” during this outbreak, compared with the 1918 pandemic. Laura Jambrina, a teacher and resident of Zamora, notes that today the church authorities have been more vocal in their public health guidance than the secular, provincial ones – advising worshippers to wash their hands and not to sprinkle holy water. Religion has, nevertheless, played a part. The South Korean cluster of Covid-19 seems to have spread via churches, while pilgrims in Iran have posted videos of themselves defiantly licking the Fatima Masumeh shrine in the city of Qom.Many other things haven’t changed. There was a lot of fake news in 1918 and there’s a lot of fake news now – and in 2020, its volume and speed of transmission is unprecedented. Donald Trump’s grandfather died of the 1918 flu, yet Trump has been accused of misleading Americans over the Covid-19 outbreak through his tweets. Meanwhile, hashtags circulating on Italian social media – such as #FlorenceDoesntStop, #CultureAgainstFear – could partly explain the difficulty the Italian authorities are having in containing the outbreak. A prominent Italian politician, Nicola Zingaretti, announced last weekend that he had come down with Covid-19 after organising a party on the theme of #MilanDoesntStop. The Harold Edel of our day will hopefully make a speedy recovery.There have been horrifying reports of people drinking industrial alcohol or taking cocaine to ward off Covid-19. In 1918, too, people thought alcohol would protect them, and quacks cashed in on people’s desperation by packaging up ineffective and sometimes even toxic concoctions into “elixirs” for which they charged exorbitant prices. Some of the more vivid images of this epidemic also echo those of a century ago. The Brazilian medic and writer Pedro Nava described in 1918 how, in Rio de Janeiro, footballers played to empty stadiums. The same is happening today, only now people watch the matches on TV.Old habits also die hard many people are still kissing each other by way of greeting. “I have to bite my tongue every time I meet someone on the street with my baby girl,” says Jambrina. “Most people will immediately touch her cheeks or kiss her.” And we seem to have forgotten that closing borders against infectious disease doesn’t work. Many countries have done so, despite the WHO’s advice, but they are now discovering that the bug is already on the inside – and they have still got to deal with it.It’s a lesson we seem to have to learn again every time a new pandemic appears, and the kneejerk tendency to pull up the drawbridge shares xenophobic roots with another – that of blaming “the other”. In 1918, before the name “Spanish flu” caught on, Brazilians called it the German flu, while the Senegalese called it the Brazilian flu. The Poles called it the Bolshevik disease and the Danes thought it “came from the south”. Now they are blaming Chinese people.If there is one feature of the current epidemic for which we should applaud ourselves – besides the reports that skies are blue again over Chinese cities, since traffic has come to a standstill – it is that we have managed to avoid giving this outbreak a stigmatising name. The WHO guidelines of 2015 on how to name diseases can take a lot of credit for this. So this new plague is not the Chinese flu or the pangolin flu, it’s the rather more mundane Covid-19 – just one more epidemic in a long line of epidemics that have struck fear into our hearts, and that we can still rein in if we would just listen to our brains instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5695715e38c31d641f57a279d36537b99be929/0_360_4011_2407/master/4011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c68b97c24bb48a66f8dfb9f39b390f27","title":"coronavirus symptoms should i see doctor covid 19","story":"What is Covid-19, how does it spread, what are the symptoms, and at what point should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

The measures come the day after the UK recorded the biggest single-day increase in virus cases, and the number of associated deaths rose to eight.The prime minister will chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee at lunchtime, and is expected to rubber-stamp a decision to move to from the “contain” phase to “delay”.The change raises the prospect of measures such as home working, school closures, limits on gatherings, and a scaling back of non-urgent hospital, police and fire services.The delay phase of the plan involves much of the same advice to people as the contain phase, including washing hands, quarantining, and testing.The government’s coronavirus plan states that possible actions include “population distancing strategies such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings”.It adds: “We would consider such measures in order to protect vulnerable iniduals with underlying illnesses and thus at greater more at risk of becoming seriously affected by the disease. The effectiveness of these actions will need to be balanced against their impact on society.”Ministers will hold cross-party talks with Labour on Thursday about the emergency legislation required to implement and enforce some of these measures.

Two patients in Dudley and Nuneaton, who were both aged over 70 and had underlying health conditions, died after contracting Covid-19, health officials said.Earlier, the death was announced of a 53-year-old British woman in Bali, Indonesia, who was already critically ill when she was diagnosed. She is believed to be the youngest British victim and the second to die overseas from the virus.The woman had been on a family holiday with her husband and four children at the island’s Four Seasons hotel. They arrived on 29 February and it was unclear where she contracted the virus. She first reported a fever on 3 March, health officials said.“The patient had severe illnesses including diabetes, hypertension, hyperthyroid and lung disease,” said Achmad Yurianto, a spokesman for Indonesia’s virus response team. She was cremated in Bali at the family’s request. Her husband is under observation in hospital and her children are in quarantine, according to local reports.In what is believed to be the first UK case in a care home, a staff member of a residential home for people with learning and physical disabilities in Desborough, Northamptonshire, was confirmed to have tested positive. The Heather Holmes facility cares provides accommodation for up 12 working-age adults.The Office for National Statistics said a member of staff at its headquarters in Newport, south Wales, had tested positive, as Public Health Wales reported that cases in the country had increased by four to 19.Barclays said an employee at its Canary Wharf office in London had tested positive and that it would deep-clean and disinfect the site.The government’s expected move to the “delay” phase over coronavirus comes after Hancock was pressed by MPs in the Commons over the government’s handling of the outbreak.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, asked Hancock to explain why the government had not already shifted to delay. Pointing to concerns raised by the editor of the Lancet, he said: “There are those in the science community suggesting that we are not following the epidemiology in the right way, suggesting that perhaps we are placing too much emphasis on behavioural science.”Downing Street has involved experts in behavioural psychology in deciding the government’s response, but the health secretary insisted the response was being guided by the best medical advice.He asked Hancock whether it was still plausible to think the virus could be contained. The health secretary replied that the World Health Organization’s decision to declare Covid-19 a pandemic had “a significant impact on the way that countries around the world will now take forward their plans”.The former business secretary Greg Clark pointed to the number of patients being tested for the virus declining in recent days, and asked how quickly capacity could be increased.Hancock insisted the government was “rolling out a big expansion of testing” but declined to give a specific timetable.Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, announced that Brexit talks planned for next week could be in doubt after European officials raised concerns about the spread of the virus.The NHS has confirmed plans to increase coronavirus testing from about 1,500 suspected cases a day to 10,000.Phillip Meyer, a businessman from Kent, said he and his son had been waiting nine days for a coronavirus test after getting a cough following a trip to northern Italy. He said: “We are testing between 1,000 and 2,000 people a day in the UK, so clearly there is a bottleneck. If in South Korea they test 15,000 a day, why can’t we do that here?”A retired intensive care doctor told the  that the increase had come “way too late” after he and his friends were repeatedly refused tests despite falling ill following a skiing trip to Ischgl, in Austria. The 55-year-old doctor from Chichester, who gave his name only as Andrew, said: “They may be upping the testing but they haven’t put Ischgl on a high-risk list, despite knowing about this for days. Six of us have been back in Chichester going about their daily life. I suspect we’ll find a big cluster in Chichester in two weeks.”Public Health England defended its decision not to test everyone reporting symptoms. A spokeswoman said: “We are testing those who are most likely to have contracted coronavirus, either through travel or by having close contact with a confirmed case with symptoms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75c20e09018a3d5f0fae9665d01e641cb7657ae4/0_71_2121_1273/master/2121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35fe508e1495eb06ca6a7ced15c2c3e2","title":"eu brings in right to repair rules for phones and tablets","story":"European commission says linear growth model of ‘take, make, use, discard’ has reached limitManufacturers of phones, tablets and laptops will face legal obligations to make their products easier to repair and reuse, under a far-reaching recycling plan from the European Union executive.Billed as “the right to repair”, the European commission will extend an eco-design law to cover phones, tablets and laptops, setting technical standards so these goods consist of changeable and repairable parts. The current eco-design directive sets energy efficiency standards for computers, TVs, dishwashers and washing machines.Virginijus Sinkevičius, European commissioner for the environment, said the “circular economy” plan was a new economic model for the continent. “The linear growth model of ‘take, make, use discard’ has reached its limits,” he told reporters. “With the growth of the world population and consumption, this linear model pushes us closer and closer to a resource crisis. The only way ahead is decoupling economic growth from extraction of primary resources and their environmental impacts.”He said that without the “circular economy” plan the EU could not meet its target for zero-emissions by 2050 or reduce pressure bioersity.Upgrading the eco-design law is one strand of the EU’s European Green Deal, a plan to transform Europe’s economy in the fact of the climate emergency.An earlier upgrade to the eco-design law to set energy efficiency standards for toasters and kettles was abandoned over a feared public backlash, after a hostile tabloid campaign during the Brexit referendum.The law will have to be agreed by EU member states and the European parliament.The commission is also considering an EU-wide scheme that would enable consumers to sell or return old phones, tablets and chargers. It also wants to introduce a common charger.Also promised in the plan:At least some of the measures will apply to the UK, as technology companies will not make goods to a different standard for the smaller British market. While negotiations between the EU and UK on a free trade agreement are ongoing, it is unclear whether the UK will follow all EU standards.The EU wants the UK to match European environmental and consumer protection standards. Without mentioning the UK directly, the recycling plan states that Brussels will “ensure” that future free trade agreements “reflect the enhanced objectives of the circular economy”.Monique Goyens, the director of the European Consumer Organisation, said the action plan was crucial to make the green transition a reality. “If we want consumers to play their part, it should be easy, convenient and affordable for them to shop sustainably, which is far from being the case today.”Some environmental campaigners criticised the commission led by Ursula von der Leyen for not attempting to reduce consumption.“It is absurd, given that the EU consumes nearly three planets’ worth of resources, that reducing absolute consumption is not at the core of the plan,” said Meadhbh Bolger, resource justice campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe. “The Von der Leyen commission’s plan for a circular economy is out of touch with the reality and urgency of the planetary emergency.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60e786e0590f036484f5c98744a5a7560e81ba17/0_93_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e840a5066a9fdaa3fec3368887149b9f","title":"italy faces calls to close everything to tackle coronavirus","story":"Authorities in virus-hit country take extreme measures as Covid-19 takes hold in EuropeAs governments across Europe cancelled events, shut schools and imposed travel bans and the World Health Organization formally declared a pandemic, the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said all stores would close nationwide bar those selling “basic necessities”, such as pharmacies and supermarkets.“Industries can stay open, but with strict measures in place, as well as essential services such as banks. Transport will be guaranteed,” Conte said on Wednesday night, warning Italy’s population of over 60 million not to “rush to the supermarkets” as shelves would be restocked as normal.On Monday the government banned its 62 million people from all travel unless certified as justified on professional or health grounds, and asked people to stay mainly at home. “Just a few days ago I asked you to change your habits, and you have responded in an extraordinary way,” Conte said.Italians’ “great sacrifices” were making “a great and precious contribution to the country”, he said. He added that the impact of the new measures would only be clear in a few weeks’ time and thanked the nation for its efforts, saying: “We’ll soon return to hugging each other.”Earlier on Wednesday, Italy’s civil protection service said the total number of coronavirus cases cases in the EU member state that has been by far the hardest hit by the virus had risen to 12,462 from 10,149, with 560 of those in intensive care.Saying that the word pandemic was “not a term to use lightly”, the WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned on Wednesday that the challenge was not whether countries could change the course of the virus but whether they would. Some are struggling with a lack of capacity, but some with “a lack of resolve”, he said.Evidence of a widening European crisis began to appear, with Albania, Belgium, Sweden, Bulgaria and Ireland all registering their first deaths from the coronavirus and Spain confirming a steep rise in cases to 2,152 – the second highest in Europe after Italy – and 50 deaths.The Elysée palace said the president, Emmanuel Macron, would address the nation on Thursday evening. Health minister Olivier Véran advised vulnerable people to stay at home and barred external visits to old people’s homes for “several weeks”. France has now recorded 2,281 confirmed cases in 10 main clusters in France and 48 deaths.Denmark shut all schools and universities after a 10-fold rise in cases since Monday. Hungary suspended all travel from Italy, South Korea, Iran and China, and Austria halted all remaining trains to Italy. Poland and Ukraine also joined the countries closing their schools and universities.Italy’s ambassador to the EU criticised a lack of solidarity from the bloc, saying it had to come up with “emergency actions that are quick, concrete and effective”.Conte and the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, later issued a joint statement saying the country was “at the forefront of the crisis” and the 26 other member states would coordinate their responses more closely.After member states including France and Germany limited exports of protective medical equipment, the statement also called for “any restrictive measure by member states to be first discussed at the European level so that vital supplies go where they are needed most”.The EU has pledged to release funds worth up to €25bn (£22bn), with the commission making €7.5bn available to trigger €17.5-€18bn in co-funding from national governments. The bloc will also also be flexible in implementing its rules on state aid to allow governments to subsidise industry as required.Among other developments:The coronavirus has disrupted travel, closed schools, halted manufacturing and played havoc with sporting, cultural and political events around the world. In the US, the number of cases has exceeded 1,000 and at least 28 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.Several major events, including the Coachella music festival, were postponed, Democratic presidential hopefuls Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders cancelled campaign rallies, colleges around the country began teaching classes online, and there were mounting concerns about the spread of the virus in residential care homes.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Governments have scrambled to promise help for companies and households affected by the epidemic, offering to extend credit to small businesses, postpone tax payment deadlines and pay compensation to people with childcare responsibilities or in self-isolation. Italy unveiled a €25bn rescue package on Wednesday.In China, however, where the virus originated, officials have declared the epidemic “basically curbed”, reporting only 24 new cases on Wednesday. The country is more concerned about importing new cases: all of those reported on Wednesday in Beijing, which has imposed a 14-day quarantine on all foreign arrivals, came from outside the country, five from Italy and one from the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00fa13581d1811a7ce8a912349d263614e0a6b1c/0_0_4176_2506/master/4176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bae16d9065d12c3a19c07df5a135a23","title":"research finds huge impact of interventions on spread of covid 19","story":"The rapid spread of coronavirus around the world could have been substantially curtailed if the broad swath of measures China brought in to control the outbreak were introduced just weeks earlier, researchers say.Sophisticated modelling of the outbreak suggests that China had 114,325 cases by the end of February 2020, a figure that would have been 67 times higher without interventions such as early detection, isolation of the infected, and travel restrictions.“From a purely scientific standpoint, putting in place a combination of interventions as early as possible is the best way to slow spread and reduce outbreak size,” said Prof Andrew Tatem at the University of Southampton.The population mapping group WorldPop at Southampton ran models on human movement and illness onset to simulate different outbreak scenarios in cities in mainland China. The models reveal how combinations of interventions and when they are introduced affects the speed and transmission of the disease.The study suggests it was crucial to move fast with the interventions China used to contain the outbreak. If testing, isolation and travel bans were brought in one, two or three weeks later than they were, the number of cases could have rocketed three, seven and 18-fold respectively.Tatem said the modelling did not include political factors, such as weighing up the restrictions against the social and economic damages and disruption such aggressive measures can have.“Of the three types of intervention we looked at, the early detection and isolation of cases likely had the strongest impact, and this is something that seems to have been in place early and been done effectively in the UK compared to other countries, such as the US,” Tatem said.“The other two types of interventions, social distancing and travel restrictions, I think do need to be looked at seriously in the coming days.”The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, also found that isolation of the infected and social distancing, such as cancelling large public events, working from home and closing schools, are expected to have a much greater impact on containing the virus than travel restrictions.Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, said the results were encouraging in suggesting that a Covid-19 epidemic could be controlled. “What is less clear from this analysis is what should happen next,” he said. In one scenario the scientists look at, lifting travel restrictions risks a second wave of infections unless contact rates are kept low. “Can that be done, and for how much longer? When can normal life resume?” he said.Rowland Kao, professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University, said interpreting the results for the UK should be done with caution. “The results themselves should not be interpreted as being universal. They will of course depend on the inidual circumstances of each country or region, where the controls are put in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559c4e2fefa1438f4f034fb20ea2e312c4d5c14e/0_61_1666_1000/master/1666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd1544140e5ff3512ed75e4205e66c2","title":"tell us your experiences testing for the coronavirus","story":"If you work for Public Health England (PHE) or NHS 111 we want to hear from youTo ease the strain on Public Health England, NHS hospital laboratories will test swab samples from people who display symptoms of coronavirus﻿.We want to hear from people working for PHE and NHS 111 about their experiences of testing people for coronavirus.

We strongly believe this temporary measure of pausing the sale of new policies and focusing on our existing customers is the right decision.” Existing LV customers are not affected.The move by one of the UK’s biggest insurers underlines unprecedented turmoil in the industry caused by the spiralling cost of dealing with travel problems caused by the outbreak. Other major insurers are taking steps to limit the cover they sell to new customers, as global airlines are cancelling thousands of flights.The number of people buying travel insurance rose sharply last month, despite the fact that most policies won’t pay out if people cancel due to concerns around coronavirus.In a separate statement Aviva said: “Insurance is designed to provide cover for unforeseen and unexpected events and is priced on this basis. The outbreak of the coronavirus means there is an increased likelihood of disruption to people’s travel plans.”Gareth Shaw, head of money at consumer group Which?, said: “It’s very alarming that LV have withdrawn the sale of travel insurance and that other providers have also started restricting the policies they offer customers.“Anyone planning a holiday should get insurance as soon as they book. If you haven’t already booked insurance and are travelling soon we urge you to get cover immediately from a reputable insurer.“The government, insurers and the travel industry must immediately tackle the huge challenge provided by coronavirus, as the industry depends on people having the confidence that they can travel with the knowledge they will be covered.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bffbba6cc402d14d068175702602068f487f168/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb04f59ae11f9c98dc14f6873ab873bc","title":"who declares coronavirus pandemic","story":"Director general says his organisation is ‘deeply concerned … by alarming levels of inaction’ The world is now in the grip of a coronavirus pandemic, the director general of the World Health Organization has said, as he expressed deep concern about “alarming levels of inaction” in the fight against the spread of the disease.In the past two weeks, the number of cases outside China has increased 13-fold, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and the number of affected countries has tripled. There are 118,000 cases in 114 countries and 4,291 people have lost their lives.“Thousands more are fighting for their lives in hospital,” Tedros said at a briefing in Geneva. “In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the many cases, the many deaths and the number of affected countries climb even higher.“We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction.”The word pandemic should not be used lightly or carelessly, he said, nor should it be misused. “It doesn’t change what countries should do,” he said.This pandemic was unlike any others in that it could be controlled, he said. The experience in China and South Korea, where the numbers of cases are falling, showed it was possible to turn things around. But many countries were not doing what was necessary.“We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,” he said.“Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity, some countries are struggling with a lack of resources, some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve,” he said.Asked which countries were failing to do enough, he and WHO’s director of emergencies, Dr Michael Ryan, refused to be specific. “You know who you are,” said Ryan. The WHO would not criticise its member states in public. But, he said, it was not enough to limit testing to small numbers of people who fitted risk criteria that might be out of date – people over a certain age with a history of travel to China, for instance.Some countries had not established sufficient capacity for isolating people, he said. Other countries were too willing to give up on contact tracing too soon, which could help slow the spread. Some countries were not communicating well with their people, giving them the information they need to keep themselves and others safe.In Iran, by far the hardest-hit country in the Middle East, the senior vice-president and two other cabinet ministers were reported to have been diagnosed with Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. Iran reported another sharp rise in the number of deaths, by 62 to 354, behind only China and Italy. Dr Jeremy Farrar, the director of Wellcome, welcomed the WHO move: “Infectious diseases do not respect borders. We need sustained and coordinated action by all governments and global institutions if we are to avert long-term catastrophe worldwide.”He said that in recent weeks, decisive action by the WHO and many national governments had already reduced the impact of the virus and bought critical time for the international community.“Now everyone, everywhere must use this short window of opportunity to intensify and maximise all efforts to contain this virus, prepare our health systems and communities for the inevitable impact.“The decisions made in the coming days and weeks will be crucial.

Hello and welcome to today’s coronavirus liveblog. The WHO has declared the coronavirus a “pandemic”, something they had been careful not to do until now. What does that mean for you and for the global economy? We’ll have the latest throughout the day.

Photograph: Alex WelshThe New York TimesAre you washing your hands correctly? While most Irish people have become much more focused when it comes to hand hygiene in recent days as fears over the impact of coronavirus have grown, a leading virologist at Trinity College Dublin has warned that the techniques employed by many are still wrong and could leave viruses on hands and fingernails.Using UV lights and a reflective cream to mimic the spread of a virus, the leader of the virology research group at Trinity, Dr Kim Roberts, was able to show just how hard it can be to clean human hands effectively.When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands, then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection.That is why frequent hand-washing and the use of hand sanitisers are so important in combating the spread of the Covid-19.Dr Roberts demonstrated how quick hand-washes were utterly useless and only served to spread the virus to arms and clothes, while even a relatively vigorous handwashing was only partially effective.She reminded people that not only do they need to wash their hands “for a minimum of 20 seconds”, they also need to allow soap to do its work before rinsing hands in water.FingernailsShe highlighted the need to ensure all parts of the hands including fingernails were washed with equal vigour.The HSE, the Department of Health and all medical experts have been reinforcing the need for people to take greater care with hand hygiene in order to curtail – in so far as is possible – the spread of coronavirus.The results of a huge study in 2015, and published in the Lancet, proved the importance of hand washing to prevent the mass spread of an illness such as coronavirus.Researchers at the University of Southampton randomly ided more than 20,000 people from GP lists into two groups, one of which was invited to visit a website designed to encourage people to wash their hands, while the other group didn’t get access.While effects weren’t huge, with 10-20 per cent reductions in infections and consultations among the former group, these small effects extrapolated to population level would produce huge benefits from a cheap and easily accessed intervention.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4200122.1583952011!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus what is a pandemic and what does the who s declaration mean","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn analyst at Fiocruz laboratory, a public health research institute, in Rio de Janeiro holds samples  to be tested for Covid-19. Photogrph: Caral De SouzaAFPWhat is a pandemic?Pandemics have nothing to do with the severity of a disease but are to do with its geographic spread. According to the World Health Organisation, a pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations.How does the WHO decide whether to call it a pandemic?Cases that involve travellers who have been infected in a foreign country and have then returned to their home country, or who have been infected by that traveller, known as the “index case”, do not count towards declaring a pandemic. There needs to be a second wave of infection from person to person throughout the community.Once a pandemic is declared, it becomes more likely that community spread will eventually happen, and governments and health systems need to ensure they are prepared for that.An epidemic, on the other hand, is a sudden increase in cases of an illness or disease that can be unique to one country or community.When is a pandemic declared?Ultimately, the WHO gets the final say. There is no threshold, such as a certain number of deaths or infections, or number of countries affected, that needs to be met. For example, the Sars coronavirus, identified in 2003, was not declared a pandemic by the WHO despite affecting 26 countries. However its spread was contained quickly, and only a handful of nations were significantly affected, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Canada.If declaring a pandemic triggers global panic, this can defeat the purpose of trying to raise awareness. Much has been written about whether the declaration of H1N1, colloquially known as “swine flu”, as a pandemic in 2009, caused unnecessary panic, overwhelming emergency departments and causing governments to overspend on antiviral medications. Coronavirus symptoms are generally mild and most people recover within six days.Now the WHO has declared Covid-19 a pandemic, what will it mean for the way the outbreak is treated and prepared for?The WHO has stressed that using the word “pandemic” does not signal a change in its approach. It urges countries to “detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilise their people”.Prof Nigel McMillan of the Menzies Health Institute in Queensland, Australia, says a pandemic declaration alerts health authorities to prepare to move beyond travel bans.“This includes preparing our hospitals for a large influx of patients, stockpiling any antivirals, and advising the public that when the time comes, they will need to think about things like staying at home if ill, social distancing, avoiding large gatherings etc,”Prof McMillan says.He says this might prove the toughest part for governments - encouraging people to change their behaviours, such as forgoing or cancelling large social events if they are sick. –  News and Media 2020Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Advice applies to to Madrid, Vitoria and Labastida in the Basque Country and La RiojaInfectious outbreak does not kill birds in high numbers or pose a risk to human healthUnion chief says Executive and British government must defend future of Belfast City Airport, connectivity and jobs\u0026lsquoWe cannot say this loudly enough . . . all countries can still change the course of this pandemic\u0026rsquoHousing conference told PPPs \u0026lsquohigh risk strategies\u0026rsquo when it comes to delivering homesTaoiseach arriving in Washington on Wednesday despite coronavirus concernsReview board to be established for investigation after application by interested partyPostmortems will not be necessary in cases of Covid-19 unless \u0026lsquoother circumstances are present\u0026rsquoState Examinations Commission says oral and practical exams are set to take placeBritish RAF fighter jets scrambled to intercept aircraft off west coast of IrelandVehicles, designer goods, enrcypted phone and documents seized during Crumlin operationHousing bodies could build 745 homes on nine sites, council\u0026rsquos head of housing saysMassachusetts has reported 70 cases linked to company\u0026rsquos Boston conference last monthWhat will it mean for the way the Covid-19 outbreak is treated and prepared for?Priests advised to use cotton bud or glove to anoint people who are dyingNine new cases in Republic Denmark to close all schools while Italy introduces further measuresOutbreak of viral infection began in 2018 with teens and young adults hardest hitCoastal flooding could occur due to combination of waves and spring tidesT\u0026aacutenaiste says Ms Lawrie told him she \u0026lsquolost her baby\u0026rsquo when they met at journalist\u0026rsquos funeral last yearQuarter of institute of technology students now come from further education sectorStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199727.1583938103!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus four people test positive in cork and waterford","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe patient had been an inpatient at University Hospital Waterford   in a medical ward as they had ‘not met the case definition’ for Covid-19 at the time.Occupational health experts are to contact all staff at University Hospital Waterford on Wednesday after a patient tested positive at the hospital, its first confirmed case of Covid-19.The hospital’s general manager Grace Rothwell confirmed in an email to all staff on Tuesday evening that the National Virus Reference Laboratory had informed the hospital that it had a confirmed case of Covid-19.According to Ms Rothwell in her email sent to all 2,290 staff, the patient had been an inpatient in a medical ward as they had “not met the case definition” for Covid-19 at the time.However, a decision was taken on March 9th to test the patient for Covid-19 and once confirmation of the virus was received the patient was transferred to an isolation room in the Pine Ward. The Pine Ward is a ward at the 381 bed hospital which was specifically opened to facilitate the isolation and care of patients either suspected or confirmed Covid-19, Ms Rothwell explained in her email.Meanwhile, a third Cork hospital has confirmed it is dealing with Covid-19 after three patients tested positive and were admitted as inpatients.Both Cork University Hospital and the Bons Secours in Cork had already confirmed they were treating patients with confirmed cases of Covid-19 but, on Wednesday, Mercy University Hospital (MUH) also confirmed cases of the virus.In a statement, MUH said it was treating “three inpatients, who have tested positive for Covid 19, all associated with travel to an infected region.”“These patients were diagnosed in the community and had a co-ordinated, planned admission to MUH. The patients are in a dedicated room in the hospital where they are receiving appropriate care.”According to an MUH source, the three in-patients are being treated together in the dedicated room because they had all been away together but the dedicated room has been isolated from the rest of the hospital.“The correct protective measures have been used at all times by all staff involved in caring for these patients,” said the MUH in its statement before referring any further queries to the HSE.The  understands that the three in-patients, all male, had returned from a skiing holiday abroad last week and began feeling unwell which in turn led their best tested for the virus and their planned admission to the MUH.On Wednesday afternoon, HSE chief executive Paul Reid tweeted: “We are entering a new phase in #Covid19. I fully support our hospitals who have to make decisions on restricting visitors based on clinical risk, patient and public safety. Please do as we urge and our ask will increase as we progress.‘Anxious time’ At Waterford, Ms Rothwell said: “We are following the guidance of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre and our Public Health colleagues in the management of contacts, for both staff and patients.“We recognise that this is an anxious time for staff, patients and relatives. Line Managers have contacted all staff identified as working in the relevant clinical areas and have shared specific advice. “Occupational Health will contact each inidual staff member tomorrow. Public Health colleagues will contact all patients identified as contacts. A 24hr Staff Care Helpline is in operation and available for staff - 1800-409-388.“Please be aware that it remains of vital importance that we continue to be vigilant and follow correct infection prevention and control practices and in particular the correct hand hygiene practices.”A spokesperson for the HSE South Hospital Group referred any media queries regarding the case to the HSE Press Office but a HSE spokeswoman said that they did not comment on inidual cases of Covid-19.It is expected that the Waterford case will be included in the cases discussed at a press briefing by Chief Medical Officer, Dr Tony Holohan on Wednesday evening when he may say how the HSE believe the patient contracted the virus.It is understood the three cases in MUH were already included in the 10 cases reported by the Department of Health on Tuesday, although this will not be confirmed until Wednesday evening.Tuesday’s figure was the largest daily rise since the virus was first detected in the State at the end of last month, and brought the total number to by 34. The number of cases in Northern Ireland increased by two to 18 on Wednesday.The emergency team also announced plans for a massive increase in testing for coronavirus, with hospital laboratories in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford set to start testing for the illness.These will back up the National Virus Reference Laboratory at University College Dublin and mean that thousands of cases a week can be processed in future. The number of suspected cases tested last week increased to 1,784, up from 297 a week earlier.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus q a we are now in uncharted waters","story":"It seems like the world has been turned upside down in recent days as a result of the coronavirus spread. Where are we now?We are in absolutely uncharted waters. And yes the world has been turned upside down. What started out as a flu-like illness passing among a relatively small number of people in Wuhan, a Chinese city most of us had probably never heard of, has spread across the world with frightening speed. At the time of writing – Tuesday, March 10th – more than 110,000 people in over 100 countries have now contracted coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, and almost 4,000 people have died.How serious is it?It is very serious, there is no two ways about it. While the vast majority of people who contract coronavirus will be fine within a couple of weeks, about 15 per cent of people will become very ill while about 5 per cent will get critically ill. The mortality rate of the illness is fluctuating from country to country and from week to week as it spreads, but with the information we have at this stage it looks like about 2 per cent of those who get the illness may die. The number falls dramatically amongst younger people and – so far at least – the percentage of children who have become seriously ill or died is minuscule.How does 2 per cent compare with flu?The mortality rate of Covid-19 is about 20 times higher than the seasonal flu. And while a mortality rate of around 2 per cent may seem small, if the disease takes hold in a country and many people are taken ill – as has happened in Italy – it can quickly equate to thousands of deaths and an enormous volume of people requiring hospital treatment. There are few countries in the world that are in a position to cope with the demands such a situation might place on their health system.How fast is it spreading?Fast. Three weeks ago there had been no reported cases in Italy. One way of measuring transmissibility is the virus’s reproduction number or R0 (“R naught”), effectively the number of people an infected person will go on to infect. Estimates from China put the R0 at somewhere between 1.5 and 4, compared with 1.4 for the average flu (and up to 18 for measles).However, R0 varies across different environments. It can be reduced by effective hygiene control measures – handwashing, controlled coughing and sneezing, even social distancing. It is also worth remembering that while the people of Wuhan didn’t know what was about to hit them in December and January, the rest of the world has had more warning.What is the incubation period?The incubation period – the time between infection and the onset of symptoms of the disease such as cough, fever and shortness of breath – is thought to range from two to 14 days.Can you pass it on without symptoms?This is a big area of uncertainty. The European Union’s disease prevention agency is set to tighten its advice on coronavirus in the days ahead as evidence emerges that people showing no symptoms can spread the virus. Until Monday the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) had advised that “people who are infected but who do not show symptoms cannot transmit the virus”, a belief that has influenced policy and quarantine decisions in several EU countries as cases balloon. This was in conflict with advice from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The WHO states that, while rare, “there are people who can shed Covid-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset”.Will we cope in Ireland?The HSE says isolation rooms have been identified in all major hospitals, where patients would be treated. We have only one state-of-the-art isolation unit in the country, in the Mater hospital, but local arrangements and transfers to the Mater would probably suffice in the event of a small number of cases. The fear is that there will be a large number of cases. Emergency medicine doctors have said they don’t have the ICU beds to handle that. One doctor in St Vincent’s hospital has pointed out that he has not had a free ICU bed since Christmas.How many people could fall ill here?The Business Post reported on Sunday, March 8th, that forecasts were suggesting that about 40 per cent of the population could become sick as a result of the virus. Paul Reid of the HSE said he could not dispute reported projections that up to 1.9 million people could become sick as a result of contracting the coronavirus, although he said the work was not yet concluded and the evidence was changing day by day.Can the virus be treated?It cannot be cured, if that is what you are asking. Doctors try to keep critically ill patients’ bodies going, providing breathing support where necessary and waiting for their immune system to fight off the virus. There is no vaccine as yet, though one might be ready by the end of the year. Antivirals are being tested in China, but there are no clear results yet.Do face masks work?People wearing face masks are likely to be the most enduring images of 2020, but many of these devices are not as efficient at preventing the transmission of viruses as people might hope. The consensus now is that regular hand-washing is a far more effective way of protecting yourself. People might derive comfort from masks, but it is worth bearing in mind that they were originally designed to filter the air you breath out and to protect healthy persons from sick persons, rather than the other way around.If I think I have the virus, what should I do?If you’ve come back from one of the affected areas – such as northern Italy where person-to-person transmission is widespread – and you have symptoms, contact your GP urgently and do not leave the house. The principal symptoms are headache, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain and fever. If you have come back from these areas and are feeling well the advice is to consult the HSE website or ring the HSELive helpline on 1850 24 1850 for advice.How should those being tested behave with co-residents?The HSE advises that family members or people sharing a residence with a suspected case should avoid contact, communicate by phone and not answer calls to the door.What is happening in Ireland now?As of Tuesday, March 10th, the number of people in the Republic who have been diagnosed with the illness is still small. A total of 24 cases of the virus had so far been confirmed, but the outlook for the days, weeks and months ahead is still grim.Are projections of 1.9m sick people an exaggeration?Not according to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. He delivered a bleak assessment on Monday, March 9th, of the potential consequences of the coronavirus outbreak in Ireland. “It is possible we are facing events that are unprecedented in modern times,” he said. He warned that more than half of the population could contract Covid-19 and he referenced death rates for the virus ranging from less than 1 per cent to more than 3 per cent, meaning large numbers of people could die of the disease in a worst-case scenario.“For the vast majority of the population this will be a mild illness and may even by asymptomatic,” he said. “However, there will be a significant part of the population who will require critical care.” The virus cannot be stopped, he said, but “it can be slowed” with the right response from the health service and across society.How can it be slowed?There are things that can be done by the Government and its agencies. But there is one thing every person in this country can do to help slow the spread of the virus.What?Yes. There is universal agreement among politicians and health professionals that proper hand sanitation is the most effective thing people can do to stop the spread of the illness. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands, then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection. That is why frequent hand-washing and the use of hand sanitisers are so important in combating the spread of Covid-19.And how do I do that properly?To answer that we will turn to the official HSE guidelines.Wet your hands with warm water and apply soap. Rub your hands together until the soap forms a lather. Rub the top of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails. Do this for about 15 seconds. Rinse your hands under running water. Dry your hands with a clean towel or paper towel.What else is being done to stop it spreading here?A lot. A €3 billion package to deal with coronavirus will pump more money into the health service, help at-risk businesses and change the rules around sick pay to encourage people who will need to self-isolate and stay away from their workplaces. An additional €435 million will be allocated to the HSE. Minister for Health Simon Harris has said this money is to be used to increase the public health capacity to trace contacts of people with the virus, as well as providing for more beds, more overtime, more staff and more homecare packages to help take pressure off hospitals.Is there more?There is a lot more. Patients have been told not to turn up at GP surgeries without an appointment in order to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus. And patients who have been to an affected area and are showing respiratory symptoms have been reminded not to go to their GP surgery, hospital emergency department, out-of-hours service or pharmacy. Instead they should phone ahead or call 112.What about public gatherings?All St Patrick’s Day parades across the country are being cancelled on foot of a recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team. Trinity College Dublin said all lectures would take place remotely. And both Ryanair and Aer Lingus said they would be cancelling all flights to and from Italy for almost a month. Ryanair is also cancelling all internal flights in Italy for the same period.What about schools?To date only a handful of schools – in Dublin and Clare – have closed following known cases of Covid-19. During a containment phase, wider school closures “are not justified”, the European Centre for Disease Control has said. If transmission of the virus becomes widespread in the days ahead, school closures will be inevitable, even though they probably would not reduce the impact of the epidemic. For now, though, it seems unlikely.What is happening across the EU?According to data from the ECDC on Tuesday, 14,890 cases were reported in the EUEEA and the UK. Italy had reported 9,172 cases, followed by France on 1,412 and Spain on 1,204. Germany had reported 1,139 cases, while there were 321 in the Netherlands and 373 in the UK. Across the EU there were 532 deaths reported, with the vast majority being reported in Italy where – at the time of writing – 464 people had died.Italy is bearing the brunt of the virus?Italy has – so far – been the the epicentre of the outbreak in Europe, and the country’s 60 million people have been placed in lockdown. Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte said after Italy’s death toll jumped by 97 to 463 that it was the country’s “darkest hour”.How are drug supplies in the EU?The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said it is closely monitoring what the spread of Covid-19 could mean for the pharmaceutical supply chains in the EU.Its officials are looking at ways to protect at-risk patients if there is a temporary lockdown of medicine manufacturing sites in areas affected by Covid-19. It is important to stress that there are no reports of such shortages of medicines within the EU.Okay, so talk to me about travel?On Tuesday, March 10th, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney announced an update on his Department’s travel advice, saying no residents of Ireland should travel to any part of Italy unless it is absolutely necessary. The red warning “do not travel” status is extremely unusual and will have to be heeded by everyone.Has it been heeded by airlines?Yes. Both Ryanair and Aer Lingus are suspending all flights to and from and within Italy following the decision of the Italian government to lock down the entire country to contain the spread of virus.Ryanair said the suspension of internal flights would come into force at midnight on Wednesday. Flights into and out of Italy will be suspended at midnight on Friday, March 13th. The measures will be in place until April 8th. Aer Lingus has cancelled all flights to and from Italy from Wednesday, March 11th until April 3rd.What if I am in Italy and not due back until Saturday?There has been no formal comment from Aer Lingus, but Ryanair passengers looking for repatriation can obtain a free move to an earlier Ryanair flight operating up until midnight on Friday, March 13th. Affected passengers who were due to travel to the country will be able to choose between a full refund or a travel credit that can be redeemed on Ryanair flights in the next 12 months.Are the Italian land borders still open?Yes, but the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, has announced an entry ban for people entering Austria from Italy by car, train or plane, unless they can provide a doctor’s certificate. Controls will be imposed along the border between the two countries. Austrians visiting Italy will be allowed to return home only if they agree to a two-week home quarantine.Is Ireland using such controls on those returning from Italy?As yet, no.How will this affect my summer holidays?It is too early to say what impact it is going to have on summer travel. If you had asked us this question two weeks ago we would have said that everything will be grand. Now, we’re not so sure. It could be that by July, the start of the high season for tourism in Europe, the virus will have peaked. Maybe it will be gone altogether. It could be that things will be much worse than they are today. There is too much uncertainty to make a firm decision on your travel plans now.So what advice can you give me?Pay attention to the travel advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and other relevant sources.Is that official advice important?It is very important. If an official advisory against travel is in place then people who have booked independent holidays and have travel insurance to that location could be able to claim for any losses they are likely to incur. With advisories in place, people who have booked with tour operators should also be able to process refunds or reschedule trips.What about flights?According to the European Consumer Centre Ireland (ECC Ireland), a natural occurrence such as Covid-19 that causes travel disruption is considered “extraordinary circumstances” outside the control of a transport provider, such as an airline. Consequently, compensation would not normally apply. For air travel, according to EU Regulation 261, passengers on cancelled flights may be entitled to have their journey either rerouted to the final holiday destination or refunded. If a land or sea journey is cancelled, passengers are entitled to rerouting or a refund.What about package holidays?For package holidays involving a journey to, or a stay in, areas affected by travel restrictions due to the virus, consumers may have the right to terminate the booking contract without paying a termination fee. This applies only to unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances that may pose a significant risk to human health and prevent consumers from making use of or reaching the destination of their booked holiday, as agreed in the travel contract.I am headng overseas soon. Can I cancel?If consumers choose to cancel their holiday to an area where no emergency measures have been declared, that is their right, but the holiday cancellation is, of course, strictly within the limits of their booking contract. Refunds may be possible, but that is by no means certain. And if passengers cancel flights voluntarily they are entitled to a full refund of airport taxes as the cancellation takes place before the flight check-in operation. But it is worth bearing in mind that admin fees imposed by airlines often make such refunds pitifully small.What about travel insurance?Now would be as good a time as any to ensure you have adequate travel insurance covering any trips you may have coming up. Ensure your policy covers cancellations as a result of official warnings from government not to travel to a destination. But timing is crucial here. Mapfre, one of the biggest travel insurance underwriters in the State, says that if a policy covers a government recommendation to avoid a country or area, a claim will be considered only if that recommendation is in place within 48 hours of a person’s intended departure.Anything else?If you are travelling anywhere in the EU in the months ahead and do not have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) or think the one you do have may have expired, then get it sorted.Remind me of what the EHIC is again?If you are travelling in Europe, the card gives you access to public health services at no cost. If you have a smartphone, download the EHIC app to help you navigate overseas health systems, and remember: your card needs to be renewed every five years. Don’t ever pay for the card. Some sites will try charging for the service, but it is free through the official site, ehic.ie.What else is happening?This remains first and foremost a public health emergency. But the pandemic is almost certainly tipping the world into a global recession. Airlines and the tourism sector at home and abroad will suffer. Some businesses will close. Stock markets will continue to take a hammering. Pension funds will be hit hard and jobs will be lost.What’s this about stockpiling food and fighting over toilet roll?That is happening alright. In countries as far apart as Japan, Australia and the US there have been reports of panicked shoppers stocking up on everything from long-life milk to noodles, while videos of people fighting in supermarket aisles over toilet paper in Australia have gone viral as coronavirus has spread.Large retail chains in the UK, including Tesco, have started rolling out a rationing system for key products and shoppers are not being allowed buy more than five of certain goods, including antibacterial gels, wipes and sprays, dry pasta, UHT milk and some tinned vegetables. Pictures of empty shelves are circulating widely on social media.Is it happening in Ireland?While there has been no formal rationing in Ireland – and no reports of loo roll riots – this country has not been immune to the panic buying and there has been a noticeable surge in the sale of canned goods, pasta and cleaning products in supermarkets here. Items deemed to be essential in the current climate, including hand sanitiser and face masks, have largely disappeared from shelves while wholesalers are reporting sales levels for groceries normally not seen outside of the peak shopping period before Christmas.This is all incredibly gloomy and scary.It is. But it is not forever. Things will settle down. Most experts say several scenarios are possible with Covid-19. It might join the four other existing coronaviruses in being endemic around the world, causing respiratory illness of varying degrees of severity. Or it may become a seasonal illness like the flu, adding to the pressure on hospitals during the winter. It is important to bear in mind that scientists all over the world are working on vaccines and treatments, and while they are still some way off, such treatments will come.So how is this going to turn out?We don’t know. But it is worth looking at China, where this whole thing is believed to have started. Its most recent figures put the number of new cases across the whole country at 19, with 17 additional deaths. It has closed the 14 emergency hospitals it built in Wuhan and Chinese President Xi Jinping flew into the city on Tuesday morning to inspect new coronavirus control efforts, according to state news broadcaster CCTV.Anything else?Just one thing.

The latest developments follow an earlier meeting between the deputy leaders of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, Dara Calleary and Simon Coveney, on a potential coalition between the two parties. A statement from the Green Party said: “The Green Party Parliamentary Party met this afternoon and agreed that, in light of the unfolding coronavirus crisis, the party are calling on all parties to suspend discussions on forming a majority government and work towards forming a crisis national government to be reviewed in three months.”Green Party TD Neasa Hourigan said the new national unity government would last for three months with a mechanism for an additional three months afterwards.She said the decision to call for such an arrangement was taken at a party meeting today because the country faces an immediate crisis due to the coronavirus spread.“We went into the election and promised we would go into this based on policies. But I do not think we can afford to go on for three weeks or even ten days going through policies line by line. I don’t want to talk about solar panels while people are losing their lives.

Photograph: Remko De WaalEPAThe position of Dutch authorities was that only people with symptoms could transmit coronavirus. It was repeated by the government, national and local health authorities, justifying a cascade of decisions that allowed the Netherlands to keep up a “business as usual” attitude even as the virus exponentially spread.The problem was, it was wrong. As early as February 21st, Chinese doctors published a case of apparent asymptomatic transmission German doctors wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine on March 5th to warn of a case near Munich. The World Health Organisation advises transmission without symptoms is possible.Despite this the Dutch government and health authorities stuck to looser quarantine advice than other European countries up to the time of publishing, telling people who had travelled from China, outbreak spots in Italy, and Iran, that they need only self-quarantine if experiencing symptoms.As well as being underpinned by a flawed assumption, the advice relies on people knowing whether they have symptoms or not. This is questionable: Chris Higgins, a GP in Australia, provoked an outcry after treating 70 patients while he had what he thought was the tail end of a mild cold, before he tested positive for Covid-19.It’s also in stark contrast to the approach in the countries most successful at containing the virus, such as Taiwan and Singapore, where authorities drew on their experience of the Sars outbreak to implement strict travel checks and preventative quarantine before even registering a first confirmed case.Inidual freedomsThe case of the Netherlands shows how a flawed belief about transmission filtered down throughout society, enabling the virus to spread. It also makes for a grand experiment in what happens when a country takes a relaxed approach to the virus, placing the maintenance of normality, personal responsibility and inidual freedoms first.The first coronavirus diagnosis in the Netherlands was on February 27th. As authorities traced his contacts, they found he had attended Carnival in the city of Tilburg in the North Brabant region on February 21st-25th. “The patient was not contagious in the days he celebrated the carnival,” the mayor of Tilburg Theo Weterings told media.In the following days, two more people who were at Tilburg carnival were diagnosed with coronavirus. One of them was a worker at Bannink Packaging in Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. His partner was also infected.\u0026nbspBannink Packaging continued to operate as normal, saying the employee was not sick when he came to work. “The chance that he has infected colleagues is therefore rather small,” the spokesperson told media.On March 4th, another Bannink Packaging employee – who commuted from Germany – was diagnosed with coronavirus.\u0026nbsp“In Germany they are a lot stricter with testing . . . We should not exaggerate. Production continues as normal. In that respect, it is business as usual,” a company representative told media. “We advise our employees to stay at home if they have symptoms. We cannot do more.”On March 5th a third employee was diagnosed as positive.\u0026nbspOn March 7th four more people tested positive in Coevorden, where Bannink Packaging is based.That day 900 students of the university society Vindicat returned from a mass ski trip in Piedmont in northern Italy in a convoy of buses to the Netherlands. Amid public concern, authorities met the students and tested four, who were found negative.“Someone who has no symptoms is not contagious,” Jossy van den Boogaard, MD in infectious disease control at local health authority GGD Groningen told media.“Can the students also infect others while they have no symptoms? No,” was the official advice. “What if someone decides to go to work or take an exam? This is their own responsibility.”No panicOn March 8th it was announced that a cleaning lady married to a Bannink Packaging employee had tested positive. The director of the school she works at wrote to parents to say there was no reason to panic, and that children could go to school as normal.By this point the outbreak in the carnival region of North Brabant had reached the point that there were shortages of protective equipment for health workers, and people were advised not to call their doctor unless their symptoms were serious.Lawmaker Eva van Esch told parliament a friend of hers had tested positive who had been refused a test for a week after returning from Italy with symptoms. Once positive, the friend had been asked to keep the diagnosis quiet and not to tell her work or contacts, van Esch said.“My party therefore wonders whether this government is actually focusing on preventing the spread of the disease, or whether the health services are primarily concerned with preventing panic,” van Esch said.Dutch testing capacity is limited, forcing authorities to prioritise testing people with a clear link. Roughly 6,000 tests had been done in the Netherlands as of March 7th, national public health institute the RIVM said, a figure that includes double-testing to exclude false positives, and testing for recovery.Twelve days after the first diagnosis, confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Netherlands had risen from 1 to 382.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4200138.1583953007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit michael gove declines to confirm irish sea checks on goods","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove arriving at the Cabinet Office in London. The British cabinet minister said an EU-UK joint committee would determine how the Northern Ireland protocol should work. Photograph: Luke DrayGettyMichael Gove, the British cabinet minister who will negotiate the implementation of post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, has declined to confirm that checks will be required on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain to the North.Mr Gove told a House of Commons committee that it would be for an EU-UK joint committee to determine how the Northern Ireland protocol should work.“The effective working of the protocol is a matter for the joint committee to resolve and I’m looking forward to that meeting in order to ensure that we can develop the protocol and implement it in all its provisions in a way that ensures that the people of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland economy benefit,” he said.EU negotiators insist that the role of the joint committee, which is due to meet for the first time on March 30th, is limited to determining matters such as which goods are assumed to be destined to remain in Northern Ireland rather than exported to the EU. But the protocol makes clear that Northern Ireland will have to follow the EU customs code, which requires information and checks on goods coming from Great Britain.Irish Sea borderPrime minister Boris Johnson has stated a number of times that there will be no checks and no border in the Irish Sea but Mr Gove said the British government was committed to implementing the protocol in full.“We are committed to making sure that the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented in order to underpin the BelfastGood Friday Agreement. And the point is well understood that the joint committee is there to ensure that it is implemented and also to resolve some of the questions over precisely how,” he said.Mr Gove suggested that the next round of talks between Britain and the EU, which is scheduled to start in London next Wednesday, could be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. And he said the government would not publish an economic impact assessment of the free trade deal it is seeking from the EU.“I am personally sceptical of efforts to say that any given impact assessment by a government department is an accurate prediction of the future. As load-bearing devices go, they are perhaps not the most effective ways of delivering a proper range of views about what the economic consequences of a course of action might be,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Joseph PreziosoAFP via GettyBernie Sanders has vowed to continue his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, despite a number of disappointing finishes in primary contests across the country that have left the Vermont senator trailing former vice-president Joe Biden.“Donald Trump is the most dangerous president in the modern history of our country, and he must be defeated,” Mr Sanders said at a press conference in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont on Wednesday afternoon. “I will do everything in my power to make that happen.”Mr Sanders has often accused the Democratic establishment of lining up against him. But he struck a more conciliatory tone on Wednesday, saying he “very much” looked forward to a live televised debate on Sunday in Arizona “with my friend Joe Biden”.The Vermont senator catalogued a series of policy-based questions he said he would ask Mr Biden on Sunday, including: “What are you going to do for the 500,000 people who go bankrupt in this country because of medically-related debt?”Biden victoriesMr Sanders nevertheless conceded that Tuesday was “obviously . . . not a good night” for his campaign, “from a delegate point of view”.Mr Biden won four of the six primaries held on Tuesday, with decisive victories in Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri and Idaho. Mr Sanders won North Dakota, and looked on course to take Washington state, where votes were still being counted.But Tuesday’s results, coupled with an underwhelming “Super Tuesday” one week earlier, cemented Mr Sanders’s second-place status behind Mr Biden, whose campaign has staged an extraordinary comeback, starting with a near 30-point win in South Carolina last month and a sweep of southern states on Super Tuesday.Mr Biden has secured 857 delegates, compared with Mr Sanders’s 709, according to the Associated Press. Four more states – Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois – will hold primary contests next week.Mr Sanders said on Wednesday that while he was “losing the delegate count” he was “strongly winning” in terms of voter support for his progressive agenda, especially among younger people.“We are winning the generational debate,” Mr Sanders (78) said. “Our campaign continues to win the vast majority of the votes of younger people. And I am talking about people not just in their 20s, but in their 30s and their 40s. The younger.”He added: “Today I say to the Democratic establishment: in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country and you must speak to the issues of concern to them.“You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.”EndorsementsMr Biden has benefited from a wave of high-profile endorsements in recent days from Democrats in Washington and across the country. Many of his backers are wary of a drawn-out primary contest similar to 2016, which they fear would weaken Mr Biden’s candidacy ahead of a general election against Mr Trump.Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a large Democratic political action committee (PAC), said on Twitter on Tuesday night: “The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for president and Priorities USA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November.”Mr Sanders has sworn off PAC money and eschewed big-money fundraisers in favour of small donations from inidual supporters.The Democratic National Committee said late on Tuesday that Sunday’s debate will be held without a live audience, amid fears over the spread of coronavirus. Both Mr Sanders and Mr Biden cancelled campaign events on Tuesday evening in Ohio, after local health officials warned against large gatherings.“At the request of both campaigns and out of an abundance of caution, there will be no live audience at the Arizona debate,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, DNC communications director. “Our number one priority has and will continue to be the safety of our staff, campaigns, Arizonans and all those involved in the debate.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Cycling commuters nearly 50 per cent more likely to be injured, study findsCoronavirus latest news: Eighth UK patient dies as WHO labels outbreak a \u0026#39pandemic\u0026#39 and laments \u0026#39global inaction\u0026#39Criminal wealth of Khazak dictator \u0026#39lives on\u0026#39 in London, High Court McMafia trial toldCoronavirus: UK to enter new phase of emergency measures with admission virus\u0026#39s effect can only be delayed not containedChild of Our Times: Turning 20, review: this millennium baby project has taught us precious littleWomen\u0026#39s groups take CPS to high court over plunging rape chargesNHS chiefs warn makeshift intensive care units will be needed as coronavirus patient numbers riseComment: Behind the scenes, I witnessed the profound sadness of Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s exitSocial replaces pub as numbers of young teetotallers soars, researchers revealComment: Sunak knows only extreme measures can defeat this coronavirus recessionTravel insurance sales may stop due to coronavirus pressure, holidaymakers warnedBernie Sanders declines to drop out of Democratic presidential race despite Joe Biden victoriesBritish and American soldiers killed in militia rocket attack on base in IraqAlex Salmond kissed and groped me, woman tells court     Recycling: Is It a Con? review - This half-baked Watchdog couldn\u0026#39t make its mind upMajor security fears as Prince Harry duped by penguin-loving pranksters posing as Greta ThunbergMarine Le Pen joins her sister on campaign trail in CalaisItaly orders closure of all shops except pharmacies and supermarkets in drastic escalation of coronavirus quarantineHarvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prisonCabinet minister self isolates while awaiting test results for coronavirus as six MPs stay at homeBudget 2020: The key cash boosts in detailWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus rising different countries uk among countries seefastest","story":"Most of the countries are in Europe – 11 in total, including the UK, France and Germany. Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden have seen the highest rate of increase over the last week, with cases in Belgium surging by over 3,000 per cent in seven days.As of last Monday, Belgium had just seven active coronavirus cases – but that figure had leaped to 238 as of Monday.The UK saw the fourth-highest increase in cases over the last week, according to data recorded by Johns Hopkins University. There were 299 active coronavirus cases in Britain on Monday, up from 32 at the start of last week – an increase of 834 per cent over the seven days. It took four days for the UK\u0027s number of cases to last double, from 106 on March 5 to 299 on March 9, putting the country in the middle of the pack in terms of the doubling rate of the virus.This is less than the rate of increase in Spain, where active cases have doubled in just two days. There, 460 people were said to have the virus, but that had increase to 1,013 on Monday.The doubling rate is, however, lower in countries in which the virus is already more established and has infected more people. In Japan and South Korea, for example, it took coronavirus nine days to last double its number of active cases.The countries with the highest number of recorded active cases as of Monday were China (18,880), Italy (7,985) and South Korea (7,307).It is important to note that other countries may have higher undetected cases because the official numbers are reliant upon rigorous testing and data collection methods in each country.The number of active cases in China – and in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus – has fallen over the last week. Hubei has seen active cases drop by 40 per cent since last Monday, while in China the number has dropped by 67 per cent.While cases are still rising in South Korea, the country\u0027s rate of growth has slowed with cases currently doubling every nine days. The most concerning trajectory is in Italy, which has the second highest number of confirmed active cases and is currently seeing that number double every three days. The main goal for the UK Government as it faces coronavirus is to contain and delay it – part of its four-point contain, delay, research and mitigate strategy.This timeline is defined by the likely progress of an outbreak in five scenarios as it moves across Europe, and is taken from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU\u0027s main public health body. But looking at case data from across Europe, it\u0027s clear that different European countries are at different stages of this strategy – and with different levels of success.Most countries managed to delay major surges in cases for at least 20 days as the number of infections in Europe remained low.Daily data sourced from the World Health Organisation and compiled by John Hopkins University shows that some of the worst affected countries were able to contain the disease for weeks.In Italy, the first substantial increase in active cases (533 per cent) did not occur for 21 days after the country had detected its first case. The UK is following a similar trajectory, with a 400 per cent increase in active cases after 24 days.Countries detecting the virus later appear to be less successful in keeping numbers low. In Austria, Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands, the virus was detected for the first time less than two weeks ago. But once it was present, each country saw the number of confirmed cases double – or even triple – in the first three days.Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology at University College London, told The  he thought it likely that the UK would follow the same pattern as Italy over the coming weeks.The trajectory of the epidemic in the UK is so far roughly comparable to the one in Northern Italy, but with the epidemic in northern Italy two to three weeks ahead of the situation in the UK, he said.The above graphic shows the speed at which cases increased in Italy. While lagging in total numbers, confirmed cases in the UK have doubled roughly once every three days in the last week, suggesting that Britain is on much the same track.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus uk enter new phase emergency measures admits viruss","story":"Britain will enter a new phase of its response to the growing coronavirus outbreak, following a £30bn package of measures aimed at postponing the peak of the crisis until June. Boris Johnson will say the UK has moved to the “delay” phase of efforts to battle the virus, and outline social distancing measures expected from the public. A meeting of Cobra on Thursday is expected to discuss the timetable for such moves, which could include asking the elderly to stay home, and encouraging working from home, as well as strict isolation by those with symptoms.  Ministers hope that pumping significant sums into business - including paying the sick pay costs for companies whose workers need time off to self-isolate - means employees are more likely to comply with such measures. As the number of confirmed cases in the UK jumped by more than a fifth overnight, the Budget was aimed at ensuring adherence to such measures, in the hope it could push the worst of an epidemic into early summer.Doing so could reduce the total number of cases in the UK, as viruses tend to spread more quickly in cold weather, and spread out the burden on the NHS, amid fears that 50 per cent of cases could occur in a period of just three weeks.Ministers have already warned that anyone suffering from a cough or cold will soon be ordered to stay home for a week.Wednesday\u0027s budget was aimed at ensuring that everyone urged to “self-isolate” or work from home to reduce the spread of the virus across the population complies with the advice.It followed fears that workers would disregard such instructions, if it threatened their livelihood or left them out of pocket. On Wednesday the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that the spread of the virus across the globe was now a “pandemic” - the first since swine flu in 2009.Some 118,381 people have now been infected, and 4,292 have died.Urging all nations to ratchet up their response to the crisis, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general said: “We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.”On Wednesday the total number of cases in the UK jumped to 456, including eight deaths.Among the cases is health minister Nadine Dorries, who last week attended a function with the Prime Minister. On Wednesday it emerged that two other MPs were in self-isolation amid fears of outbreak in parliament.It came as UK hospitals were told to create makeshift intensive care units, and to stop treating coronavirus cases in isolation, as pressures on wards soar. On Wednesday the Chancellor scrapped business rates for small firms for the next year as part of a £12 billion package to help get the country through the current crisis.Almost half of all business premises will be exempt from paying rates in the 2020-21 financial year, as the Chancellor said he would do whatever it takes to support the economy.Business loans of up to £1.2m per firm, grants of £3,000 for small businesses and help with footing the bill for sick pay were part of a £7bn package for companies and the self-employed. It also includes a £500m hardship fund to enable councils to help people struggling to pay council tax and other bills.The Chancellor allocated £5bn for the NHS, social care and other local authority spending, with more to come if needed.In his first Budget, Rishi Sunak warned of a significant but temporary disruption to the UK economy but vowed: We will get through this together.The government will meet costs for businesses with fewer than 250 employees of providing statutory sick pay to those off work because of coronavirus. It came hours after the Bank of England announced an emergency cut in interest rates.He also announced a cash boost for theatres, cinemas, pubs and B\u0026ampBs, in a bid to keep people spending money as normal in the wake of the crisis.All alcohol duties were frozen while the hardest-hit entertainment industry were given a tax break to keep it going while people increasingly stay home.The measures were part of a £18billion spending spree, in addition to an emergency £12billion of measures in response to the health crisis.On Thursday  Boris Johnson will outline Britain’s move from “contain” to “delay” of the epidemic.It is likely to include major measures to keep more people at home, especially the most vulnerable. Restrictions on public gatherings, travel and working from home are other measures under close examination. It came as new modelling from the University of Southampton showed that coronavirus could have infected 7.6 million people in China alone, had the country not gone into lockdown.Researchers calculated that the estimated number of cases - 114,325 by February 29 - would have risen 67 fold, had draconian measures not been enacted to shut down transport systems, cut off cities, restrict social contact and quickly isolate suspected patients.Major provider LV on Wednesday stopped offering travel insurance, with warnings in the USA that the crisis could become Donald Trump’s Hurricane Katrina. In Germany Angela Merkel warned 70 per cent of the country -more than 50 million people could get the disease.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pet cats better hunting prey wild animals study suggests","story":"Your pet cat could be better at hunting and killing its prey than wild animals are, according to a new study.Scientists have found that, in a given area, domestic cats would kill two to 10 times more wildlife than a wild predator of a similar size. The trail of killings left behind by a household cat is often limited to a radius of roughly 100 metres around their home – as any owner who has had a dead mouse deposited on their doorstep can attest. This means the effect of their hunting is focused on an area usually encompassing a few gardens on either side of their home, while wild predators kill prey more widely. According to the new study, focused hunting by pets can have a big effect on a local wildlife population.Researchers from North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences worked with scientists from six countries to collect GPS cat-tracking data and prey-capture reports from 925 pet cats.Most of the animals came from the US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand.Lead author Roland Kays said: Since they are fed cat food, pets kill fewer prey per day then wild predators, but their home ranges were so small that this effect on local prey ends up getting really concentrated.Add to this the unnaturally high density of pet cats in some areas, and the risk to bird and small mammal populations gets even worse.We found that house cats have a two to 10-time larger impact on wildlife than wild predators – a striking effect.Researchers asked pet owners to track their cats to see where they went and report on the number of prey they brought home.GPS trackers measured the distances travelled by the house cats, which spent their days both indoors and outdoors.Prof Kays said: We knew cats were killing lots of animals – some estimates show that cats in North America kill from 10 to 30 billion wildlife animals per year – but we didn\u0027t know the area in which that was happening, or how this compared with what we see in nature.In the study, published in the Animal Conservation journal, scientists calculated the amount of prey killed per year by house cats and ided the number by the area in which the cats hunted.Some adjustments were made to the prey count as the animals do not necessarily take all their kills home.According to the study, house cats killed an average of 14.2 to 38.9 prey per 100 acres, or hectare, per year.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"worlds smallest dinosaur size hummingbird study finds","story":"The world\u0027s smallest dinosaur was the size of a hummingbird, a new study has suggested.A 99-million-year-old dinosaur was found trapped in amber by researchers, who believe it may be the smallest Mesozoic dinosaur discovered to date. The new bird-like species was identified from a skull that had been preserved in amber in northern Myanmar, according to findings published in the journal Nature. At only 7.1mm in length, it bore a skull similar to the size of a bee hummingbird - the smallest living bird - and has been named Oculudentavis khaungraae. Species preserved in amber present an unparalleled opportunity for scientists to study soft tissue and skeletal anatomy - which are not typically preserved in sediments. The name of the new dinosaur means “eye tooth bird as, despite its small size, it was believed to have been a predator. A large eye socket was the dominant feature in its skull, with a narrow opening that lets in small amounts of light, according to authors Jingmai O’Connor, Luis Chiappe and colleagues.This suggested Oculudentavis was better suited to daylight conditions, the study said. More menacingly, an array of as many as 30 sharp teeth on its upper and lower jaw led the authors to conclude the dinosaur targeted creatures lower down the food chain. Such a trait would mark it out from modern birds of a similar size, which have no teeth and feed on nectar. Roger Benson, a professor of palaeobiology at the University of Oxford wrote in an accompanying column: “In the past few years, Burmese amber has yielded surprising insights.”“The potential for continued discovery remains large — especially for animals of diminutive sizes.”One of the researchers who helped recover the fossils from Myanmar, Lars Schmitz, said: Amber preservation of vertebrates is rare, and this provides us a window into the world of dinosaurs at the lowest end of the body-size spectrum.Its unique anatomical features point to one of the smallest and most ancient birds ever found.He added: This discovery shows us that we have only a small glimpse of what tiny vertebrates looked like in the age of the dinosaurs.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/11/12/sunak.jpg","title":"coronavirus budget 2020 business rates","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces\u0026nbsp£30bn stimulus package to deal with economic impact of virus outbreakThe Government has temporarily abolished business rates for thousands of small firms as part of emergency measures to deal with the economic fallout from the coronavirus.Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a £30bn stimulus package that includes £12bn specifically targeted at mitigating the virus\u0027 impact.Retail, leisure and hospitality companies\u0027 with a rateable value of less than £51,000 will not pay any business rates this year. These sectors are expected to be among the worst affected as people cut back on travel and stay home during the coronavirus outbreak.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFirms in England will not have to pay any business rates on nearly half of all commercial properties, the chancellor said, while a discount that pubs receive on their rates will increase from £1,000 to\u0026nbsp£5,000.Business rates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are set by their devolved administrations. The government will also review\u0026nbspthe long-term future of business rates, a property tax which has been blamed for damaging UK high streets by burdening struggling firms with large bills.Follow live updates on the BudgetDelivering\u0026nbsphis first Budget speech\u0026nbspless than a month into his new job, the\u0026nbspchancellor\u0026nbspannounced £1bn\u0026nbspof lending via a government-backed scheme.The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme will guarantee up to 80 per cent of banks\u0027 losses on loans provided to small businesses on amounts up to\u0026nbsp£1.2m.Cash grants of up to £3,000 will be made available to 700,000 of the smallest firms that are exempt from business rates.\u0026nbspCompanies with less than 250 staff will also receive funding totalling up to £2bn\u0026nbspto cover the cost of sick pay during the outbreak.Mr Sunak announced statutory sick pay of £94.25 per week will be available for all of those advised to self isolate during the outbreak, even if they do not have symptoms. This will not extend to zero hours workers or those who are self employed.Instead, millions of gig economy workers will be given help through a £500m boost to the benefits system, including a temporary halt to the minimum floor in universal credit and quicker payments for employment and support allowance (ESA) claimants.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The\u0026nbspdigital services tax of 2 per cent on large technology companies\u0027 revenues\u0026nbspis designed to stop the Exchequer missing out on profits shifted into tax havens. It\u0027s expected to raise £440m a year.Arun Birla, a partner at law firm\u0026nbspPaul Hastings warned that implementing the tax will not be easy. Whilst Spain and Italy are following suit, implementing their own unilateral taxes, what is really needed is a multijurisdictional approach that encompasses all nations, preventing them from implementing multiple versions of what is fundamentally the same legislation, he said.\u0026nbspThat said, setting up a global policy is no mean feat, and will only be achieved if all countries have the desire to do so.”Entrepreneurs relief, a tax break for business owners that costs £2bn a year,\u0026nbspwill be substantially reduced.\u0026nbspThe government will cut the total amount of relief an inidual can claim over their lifetime from £10m to £1m, saving around £6bn\u0026nbspfor the public purse over this parliament.\u0026nbspLess than one in ten claimants say\u0026nbspthe relief was an incentive to set up their business, and it is unfair, with three quarters of the cost going to just 5,000 iniduals, Mr\u0026nbspSunak said.There was bad news for the economy, however,\u0026nbspas the OBR again cut its forecast for growth and\u0026nbspproductivity.The chancellor forecasts the UK economy will grow 1.1 per cent this year, before taking into account any hit from coronavirus. That\u0027s down from 1.4 per cent predicted by the OBR in March last year.The downgrade\u0026nbspcame after official figures released on Wednesday morning showed the economy did not grow at all in January, dashing Conservative hopes of a post-election bounce.\u0026nbspTom Leman, head of retail and consumer at law firm Pinsent Masons,\u0026nbspsaid: “The abolition of business rates for small to medium-sized retailers and restaurants will be extremely welcome news.On the basis the coronavirus is not a long term issue for these businesses it is crucial that they have the liquidity to see them through the worst.This will definitely help the cause and hopefully see many of them come out the other side ready to benefit from the increased spending power prompted by the money people are currently saving on their discretionary spend.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

These sectors are expected to be among the worst affected as people cut back on travel and stay home during the coronavirus outbreak.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFirms in England will not have to pay any business rates on nearly half of all commercial properties, the chancellor said, while a discount that pubs receive on their rates will increase from £1,000 to\u0026nbsp£5,000.Business rates in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are set by their devolved administrations. The government will also review\u0026nbspthe long-term future of business rates, a property tax which has been blamed for damaging UK high streets by burdening struggling firms with large bills.Follow live updates on the BudgetDelivering\u0026nbsphis first Budget speech\u0026nbspless than a month into his new job, the\u0026nbspchancellor\u0026nbspannounced £1bn\u0026nbspof lending via a government-backed scheme.The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme will guarantee up to 80 per cent of banks\u0027 losses on loans provided to small businesses on amounts up to\u0026nbsp£1.2m.Cash grants of up to £3,000 will be made available to 700,000 of the smallest firms that are exempt from business rates.\u0026nbspCompanies with less than 250 staff will also receive funding totalling up to £2bn\u0026nbspto cover the cost of sick pay during the outbreak.Mr Sunak announced statutory sick pay of £94.25 per week will be available for all of those advised to self isolate during the outbreak, even if they do not have symptoms. This will not extend to zero hours workers or those who are self employed.Instead, millions of gig economy workers will be given help through a £500m boost to the benefits system, including a temporary halt to the minimum floor in universal credit and quicker payments for employment and support allowance (ESA) claimants.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The\u0026nbspdigital services tax of 2 per cent on large technology companies\u0027 revenues\u0026nbspis designed to stop the Exchequer missing out on profits shifted into tax havens. It\u0027s expected to raise £440m a year.Arun Birla, a partner at law firm\u0026nbspPaul Hastings warned that implementing the tax will not be easy. Whilst Spain and Italy are following suit, implementing their own unilateral taxes, what is really needed is a multijurisdictional approach that encompasses all nations, preventing them from implementing multiple versions of what is fundamentally the same legislation, he said.\u0026nbspThat said, setting up a global policy is no mean feat, and will only be achieved if all countries have the desire to do so.”Entrepreneurs relief, a tax break for business owners that costs £2bn a year,\u0026nbspwill be substantially reduced.\u0026nbspThe government will cut the total amount of relief an inidual can claim over their lifetime from £10m to £1m, saving around £6bn\u0026nbspfor the public purse over this parliament.\u0026nbspLess than one in ten claimants say\u0026nbspthe relief was an incentive to set up their business, and it is unfair, with three quarters of the cost going to just 5,000 iniduals, Mr\u0026nbspSunak said.There was bad news for the economy, however,\u0026nbspas the OBR again cut its forecast for growth and\u0026nbspproductivity.The chancellor forecasts the UK economy will grow 1.1 per cent this year, before taking into account any hit from coronavirus. That\u0027s down from 1.4 per cent predicted by the OBR in March last year.The downgrade\u0026nbspcame after official figures released on Wednesday morning showed the economy did not grow at all in January, dashing Conservative hopes of a post-election bounce.\u0026nbspTom Leman, head of retail and consumer at law firm Pinsent Masons,\u0026nbspsaid: “The abolition of business rates for small to medium-sized retailers and restaurants will be extremely welcome news.On the basis the coronavirus is not a long term issue for these businesses it is crucial that they have the liquidity to see them through the worst.This will definitely help the cause and hopefully see many of them come out the other side ready to benefit from the increased spending power prompted by the money people are currently saving on their discretionary spend.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Australia, where a brutal drought persisted for months last year, farmers have suffered from mental health problems because of the threat to their livelihoodEven dedicated climate skeptic Jeremy Clarkson has come to recognise the threat of climate change after visiting the Tonle Sap lake system in Cambodia. Over a million people rely on the water of Tonle Sap for work and sustinence but, as Mr Clarkson witnessed, a drought has severley depleted the water levelIn reaction to these harbingers of climate obliteration, some humans have taken measures to counter the impending disaster. Ethiopia recently planted a reported 350 million trees in a single day Morocco has undertaken the most ambitious solar power scheme in the world, recently completing a solar plant the size of San FranciscoElectric cars are taking off as a viable alternative to fossil fuel burning vehicles and major cities across the world are adding charging points to accomodateCities around the world are embracing cycling too, as a clean (and healthy) mode of transport. The Netherlands continues to lead the way with bikes far outnumbering peopleCycling infrastructure is taking over cities the world over, in the hope of reducing society\u0027s dependency on polluting vehiclesDespite positive steps being taken, humans continue to have a wildly adverse effect on the climate. There have been numerous major oil spills this decade, the most notable being the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010More recently, large swathes of the Amazon rainforest were set alight by people to clear land for agricultureThis decade may have seen horrors but it has led to an understanding that the next decade must see change if human life is to continueFinancial services companies that are not prepared for a transition to a low-carbon world may be penalised by the bank and ordered to hold additional capital, Mr Carney said.Mr Carney, who has led a movement to make companies disclose the climate risks they face, will leave the bank next week to take up a position as finance advisor to the UN climate change conference, COP26.

The great variance in how well investments are protected from climate risk could leave savers and pension holders out of pocket.“More information is needed to help consumers make informed decisions.

But, until now, it had remained only theoretical, and eluded anyone who tried to actually put it into action.Scientists now hope that the discovery can be used to more precisely build quantum computers, and could be used to shed light on some of the mysteries of quantum science.This discovery means that we now have a pathway to build quantum computers using single-atom spins without the need for any oscillating magnetic field for their operation, says the University of New South Wales\u0027\u0026nbspScientia\u0026nbspProfessor of Quantum Engineering Andrea\u0026nbspMorello.Moreover, we can use these nuclei as exquisitely precise sensors of electric and magnetic fields, or to answer fundamental questions in quantum science.At the moment, a nuclear spin of this kind is controlled with magnetic fields. But the ability to do so with electric fields has far-reaching consequences, the researchers said. Magnetic fields must be generated using large coils and high currents and need larger spaces the equipment needed to generate electric fields is much smaller and more controlled.Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is one of the most widespread techniques in modern physics, chemistry, and even medicine or mining, says Professor Morello. Doctors use it to see inside a patient\u0027s body in great detail while mining companies use it to analyse rock samples.This all works extremely well, but for certain applications, the need to use magnetic fields to control and detect the nuclei can be a disadvantage.Changing away from that technique is like the difference between moving a billiard ball by picking up and shaking the whole table around, said Professor Morello – it will move, but make a mess of the rest of the ball\u0027s place. The electric resonance can be used to push the ball exactly where it needs to be.The technique was first proposed by another researcher in 1961. But researchers stumbled back on it by accident, they said, after it had been left ignored for more than half a century because it had been too difficult to demonstrate in practice.Now the researchers hope to be able to use their new way of controlling atoms for a variety of different breakthroughs.This landmark result will open up a treasure trove of discoveries and applications, said Professor Morello.The system we created has enough complexity to study how the classical world we experience every day emerges from the quantum realm. Moreover, we can use its quantum complexity to build sensors of electromagnetic fields with vastly improved sensitivity. And all this, in a simple electronic device made in silicon, controlled with small voltages applied to a metal electrode!Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It had these weird eyes staring out looking to the sides.

It is a Budget of a government that gets things done.”But Mr Corbyn dismissed the chancellor’s announcements as “smoke and mirrors” which left austerity “baked into our system”.He pointed to IFS analysis which suggested that an immediate £54bn boost to day-to-day spending on Whitehall departments outside health and social care would be needed simply to get Budgets back to 2010 levels.“The government’s boast of the biggest investment since the 1950s is frankly a sleight of hand,” said Mr Corbyn. “It’s in fact only the biggest since they began their slash-and-burn assault on our services, economic infrastructure and living standards in 2010.“Having ruthlessly forced down the living standards and life chances of millions of our people for a decade, the talk of levelling up is a cruel joke.”Care providers and think tanks described the lack of additional funding for social care in the chancellor’s Budget as “hugely disappointing”.Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt described it as a “glaring omission”, adding that there was a “desperate” need for a long-term social care plan.And the Trades Union Congress said that while the spending U-turn was “badly overdue”, the priority for investment should be to “repair the damage” of 10 years of austerity.“Helping working families and rebuilding public services must come first,” said Frances O’Grady, TUC\u0026nbspsecretary general. “And we need to see concrete action on the challenges of the future.“This means banning zero-hours contracts, sorting social care, ending the UK’s dire regional inequalities, setting out a credible plan to achieve net zero, and getting an EU trade deal that supports jobs and workers across the UK.”But the Confederation of British Industry praised the chancellor for heeding business calls for “decisive action on vital long-term issues” like infrastructure development and incentives to invest in research and development.Carolyn Fairbairn, the organisation’s director general, said: “Some gaps still need to be filled in around skills, energy efficiency and powering the UK’s low-carbon future but\u0026nbspoverall, today’s Budget is a powerful signal to firms at home and abroad that the UK can and will manage the immediate challenges and long-term opportunities in parallel.”\u0026nbspThe chancellor\u0026nbspadded: “We will get through this – together. The British people may be worried, but they are not daunted. We will protect our country and our people. We will rise to this challenge.”Office for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspInstitute for Fiscal Studies\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We expect this shortfall to be partly reversed as the specifics of the trading relationship are clarified, hence reducing uncertainty.\u0026nbspBut, working in the other direction, we expect the adverse effect of higher trade barriers to build through our five-year forecast period and beyond.Figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning show that the economy has flat-lined, even before the effects of coronavirus bite.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

DNA results show that the hatchlings were, in fact, reproduced through parthenogenesis!Parthenogenesis is unusual, with the first cases recorded in 2006 in the UK at both London and Chester Zoo, according to Scientific American.The publication explained how it works, saying: In parthenogenesis, the mother\u0027s half-set of chromosomes doubles up to generate the full complement. Hence, the offspring derives all its genes from the mother, but they are not a duplicate of her genome.They reported that only 0.1 percent of all vertebrate are able to reproduce asexually.Komodo dragon attacks tourist in Indonesia national parkExplaining how parthenogenesis developed, the zoo wrote that the process developed in the wild due to their isolated nature.In the wild,\u0026nbspKomodo\u0026nbspdragons mainly live isolated and often become violent when approached, which has allowed these animals to evolve to reproduce both sexually and parthenogenetically.Announcing the news, the zoo playfully posted: Our Komodo Dragon hatchling DNA results are in!*Maury Voice* Kadal, you are NOT the father!Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Do it again,” the prime minister said, as he broke into a laugh.The pair then demonstrated an elbow bump greeting before leaving the stage.On Tuesday, Dutch health officials said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country had risen by 61 to 382, with four deaths reported.The mistake has shown the difficulty governments face with attempts to prevent outbreaks of the virus, formally known as Covid-19, which is believed to spread in a similar way to influenza.Last week, the World Health Organisation said it was understood that coronavirus spreads “via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick”.Health officials have advised people to wash their hands often with soap and water, avoid close contact with people who are unwell, and cover their mouth or nose with a tissue or sleeve when coughingsneezing to prevent the spread of the virus.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What is wrong with the system Meanwhile the LA Times reports that his other aunt, Crystal Diuguid, even claimed to her therapist that Anthonys mum was beating him and locking him in a room with no bathroom or access to food.Horried, by what she had heard, the therapist called the child abuse hotline.But despite these countless interventions, Anthony was allegedly continually tortured and eventually killed by his mum and her partner, prosecutors claim.They intend to seek the death penaltythey are convicted.Both Barron and Leiva have pleaded not guilty, and Anthonys siblings have been removed from the home.The grand jury transcripts in the Avalos case were unsealed in December after The Times petitioned in court to obtain the records.The second little boy, Noah Cuatro, died in hospital in July last year, one day after his parents called emergency services from their home in Palmdale, LA, to claim theyd found him drowned in their apartment complex pool.However, authorities quickly treated the death as suspicious after medical staff spotted injuries on the little boy that were inconsistent with drowning.His parents, Jose Maria Cuatro Jr.,  and Elaine Juarez, , are now accused of torturing him for a period of four months leading up to this death.Prosecutors also claim there were signs he was sexually assaulted the same day he was found motionless in the pool.The pair were charged last month with one count of murder and torture, while Cuatro also faces an additional charge of assault on a child causing death and one count of sexual penetration of a child under the age of .Juarez also faces one count of child abuse under circumstances likely to cause death.According to the LA Times, Noah spent his few years of le between foster care and the custody of his parents and great-grandmother.Like Gabriel and Anthony, he too had been visited by the DCFS multiple times - with a case worker even going to a judge in May  to claim his le was at imminent risk. While the judge issued a court order to remove him, the DCFS reportedly never executed the order.Noah is said to have died two weeks after the DCFS updated the court in June and asked for a -day continuance to investigate further.Garrett Therolf, a former Los Angeles Times reporter and series producer, ultimately claimed in the documentary that more than  children in the LA County with at least some DCFS involvement in their lives have died of abuse and neglect since Gabriels  death.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Covid- crisis was born in Wuhan and raises red-flag warnings over the country’s future prosperity and stability.Coronavirus is no joke but I am glad to say the opportunity is all ours. It gives us cover to do things we might never have otherwise dared.New Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use his first Budget on Wednesday to seize that chance with both hands.“We go into this in a very strong position,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr. “We need to make sure we respond at scale to whatever scenario comes our way.”This will be no “safety first” Budget. The coronavirus health emergency provides an option to be bold.It unlocks the Treasury stranglehold on spending, borrowing, infrastructure and, crucially, tax reform.Cash will be unleashed first into the NHS, with food and medical supplies a priority for the sick and elderly, plus emergency welfare for those whose earnings suddenly dry up.But there will also be money for big projects — schools, roads and railways and, with another deluge of rain on its way, a welcome doubling of spending on flood defences to £.BILLION.There will be both tax cuts and rises, but plans for a hike in fuel duty will be ditched, I gather.“Our public finances are in good shape,” the Chancellor insists. “I will lay the foundations for future growth and prosperity, level up the country and spread opportunity.”In other words, what is good for Britain’s physical health is also good for economic well-being.The way the world does business changed abruptly when Beijing celebrated Chinese New Year by shutting down most of the country.Today the “workshop of the world” is silent — with alarming implications for a regime whose authority depends on feeding nearly a fth of the planet’s population.Global giants including Volkswagen and Mercedes in Germany, and Apple in the USA, whose vital supply lines have been severed, are weighing their options.Thanks to Donald Trump’s trade wars, they were already reassessing their reliance on cheap but now unreliable overseas labour. The revival of “Rust Belt” cities and recruitment of local workers back home will accelerate.Others with no interest in capitalism are also finding opportunities.We may look back on those “before and after” satellite images of noxious nitrogen- dioxide clouds over China, and the clear blue skies today, as a turning point.Extinction Rebellion protesters might start digging up turf outside the Chinese Embassy, instead of vandalising Cambridge University.We will also notice a drop in air pollution after the collapse of shipping and plane travel.Ships carry  per cent of world trade but burn the heaviest oil, from the dirtiest dregs of a barrel of crude.Greta Thunberg and her “climate emergency” apostles will pounce on this evidence that we can live on fresh air.More seriously, we may be witnessing the end of globalisation — the spread of interlocking world trade which has raised living standards and spread prosperity for millions.It leaves Britain with the opportunity to pick up some of the slack.Ministers are already encouraging firms to raise productivity by swapping cheap migrant labour for expensive but efficient robot technology.The crisis will also have an impact on negotiations with the European Union.Britain is well placed, as a nimble sovereign nation with its own floating currency, to take advantage of fast-moving developments.We have low inflation, low unemployment, a near-record number in work and strong public finances.For the European Union, with its straitjacket single currency and paralysing regulation, the coronavirus crisis has no upside.Hundreds of firms and zombie banks are near collapse — including German giant Deutsche Bank. A downturn will hit firms and raise unemployment, already double the UK rate.EU negotiator Michel Barnier will soon have to choose — between the danger of a No Deal Brexit in December and the opportunity of a Canada-style arrangement which benefits all sides.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We had another who actually had both legs from his left side amputated.“They’ll usually start with the legs because it doesn’t kill the dog, so it means that the adrenaline is pumping around the dogs system.“They believe that the longer they can keep the dog alive while they’re preparing the meat, the better it will be for them.”The charity has rescued , dogs since it was set up in , but millions more have ended up being maimed and slaughtered in an industry estimated to be worth over £m worldwide.Emily, who usually lives in the north east province of Harbin but is back in Devon because of the coronavirus outbreak, tells Sun Online: “Knowing that humans are capable of that is probably the hardest part.”Every June, in the south east city of Yulin, thousands of dogs are slaughtered, butchered, cooked and eaten for the ten-day Lychee and Dog Meat Festival, where some believe the fruit and meat combination will bring health through the long winter months.Footage from last year’s event, which showed a dog being blowtorched alive, caused outrage around the world.But the thousands slaughtered at Yulin are just a drop in the ocean for a legal trade that sees million dogs slaughtered worldwide annually.Although it’s not part of the mainstream Chinese diet, China is the worlds largest dog meat market, with , tonnes produced each year. A recent pork shortage sent the price sky high and boosted sales of dog products.Despite producers claiming the meat comes from legal ‘dog meat farms’, the lucrative trade has also led to an epidemic of dog thefts from pet owners, with one study finding that  per cent of households in one village lost a dog in the last few years.Gangs of dog thieves capture strays and pets, sometimes through the use of anaesthetic-tipped needles shot from blow pipes or crossbows.Dogs are typically bludgeoned to death in front of each other, put into a de-hairing machine to remove fur, and then blowtorched for sale to markets.“I went to many slaughterhouses where we saw collars,” says Peter Li, Associate Professor of East Asian Politics at the University of Houston-Downtown. “Some dogs even had a jacket on.“I witnessed the dogs waiting to be slaughtered, they were trembling and huddling with each other.They slaughtered all the dogs in the morning but they’d left  dogs for the next day. All these twelve dogs stood in a pool of blood.In December , Chinese police in Anhui province arrested a gang that sold nearly , poisonous syringes to dog thieves.In the same month, a court in Fujian province sentenced a dog thief in a rural village to death for trying to shoot a dog with a poisoned dart but accidentally killing a pregnant woman.Meanwhile, last May a gang of  people in Jiangsu province were sentenced to between one and six years in prison for poisoning and stealing dogs, then selling more than ,kg of dog meat worth , yuan .Food safety laws are often broken by the dog traders, who smuggle the animals across borders without legitimate paperwork.But this gives activists a chance to intervene, by stopping cramped trucks in quiet country lanes and reporting them.“They’ll call the local authorities because they know these dogs shouldn’t be on the trucks - they’re being illegally transported,” says Emily.“There are so many local activists, they’ll actually try to barricade the trucks to allow them to have that time for the local authorities [to arrive].“Then the dogs get handed over to organisations such as ourselves.”After being checked for disease, and given vaccination jabs, the dogs are taken into the Harbin shelter before being re-homed around the world.“With a lot of them, we need to spend a lot of time behaviourally just to build up trust,” says Emily.Emily - who founded the Harbin SHS centre with fellow dog lovers Aimee Clark and Hayley Hayes - originally went to China to travel and teach but, missing her family dog, she volunteered at a the only dog home in the area.I didnt know anything about the dog meat trade and it was a massive eye opener, she said.I didnt know that anything like that existed over there. You cant really close your eyes once you know that thats going on. Then I met the other two girls, and they were very similar in their mindset.Hayley initially found five dogs that needed help and the three girls decided to set up a rescue home.We started with these five dogs. And then it went from five dogs to , then  and , and it just built from there.Despite the booming trade, there are an increasing number of pet lovers in China as well as growing opposition to the slaughter of dogs.“Animal lovers are winning the debate,” says Peter Li. “The other side are absolutely on the defensive.”In , the Humane Society Internationalhanded over a letter signed by .million people calling for an end to the annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival, supported by  Chinese animal protection groups.Clare Bass, UK Director of HSI, said: “Contrary to the assumptions by many in the West, most people in China don’t eat dogs and in fact they are horried at the thought of a trade that takes their canine companions away from them.”As the coronavirus outbreak saw the Chinese government introducing laws banning the sale and consumption of wild animals, one South China city, Shenzhen, also drafted legislation which explicitly bans eating dog meat.It is still not illegal to kill and eat dogs in the UK and campaign groups claim the lack of a ban sets a bad example to other countries where the practice is more common.Giles Watling, MP for Clacton, agrees the law should change here.“Because we’re a world leader in animal welfare, we need to wave the flag to the rest of the world,” he says.“What we can do is pass a law that outlaws the consumption of dog and cat meat. It’s not for us to dictate to other cultures what they should or should not eat, but it’s for us to say: ‘this is what we do,you like it, follow us’.”For Emily, the hard work continues but it does have its rewards.The yearly bill, supported by donations, is more than £, and Emily estimates she’s spent around £, of her own money on the rescue effort.“I wouldn’t change it for a thing, at all, they’re worth everything, she says.When see the happy ever afters, the dogs with the final families and living the lives that they deserve to live, that feels feels pretty good. You can follow Slaughterhouse Survivors on Instagram at https:www.instagram slaughterhouse_survivors Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the happiest day collectively I remember experiencing in the UK since the  London Olympics.We backed Prince Harry in his ious good causes like the Invictus Games.And we saluted the daring approach Meghan was making to modernising the Royal Family. I welcomed her approach and had much excitement that she could finish what Princess Diana had started.But there was criticism too. And aside from the vile trolls in that cesspit otherwise known as social media, most of it was fair and balanced.Like, for example, the couple preaching about our carbon footprints and the need to change our behaviour, while taking four private jet flights in  days.They may not have liked it, but they clearly thought about those objections because the couple now claim they will do what they can to fly commercially.There were many objections from within the Royal Family about the couple’s behaviour and demands – and there are two sides to this story.Many courtiers will tell you Harry and Meghan were rude and didn’t respect the hierarchy and pecking order that’s essential for smooth royal operations.But those close to Harry and Meghan have a very dferent perspective. They’ve told me that the couple felt they were under attack by royal staff members and other households from day one.We worried about the obvious changes to Harry, who went from happy go lucky to angry and brittle.We also questioned why so many of Meghan’s old friends and family members – including her own father Thomas – were no longer in her le.From a personal perspective, I value my school friends and blood relatives more than anyone  because they’ve known me for so long and know how to bring me down to earth whenever that might be required.But those small criticisms pale into insignicance when you compare the column inches and media coverage devoted to the issues that Harry and Meghan care about.Watching Meghan on stage at Robert Clack School in Dagenham working the crowd of teenagers like a true Hollywood princess, it’s very obvious the Royal Family are about to lose a superstar – and no one is celebrating that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see this for myself in my home town of Margate, where the rows of boarded up shops in the centre create a mood of permanent despair.In fact, for all the recent talk of regeneration in the Kent coastal town, it remains in the top one per cent of most deprived neighbourhoods in England.In the wake of Coronavirus, the Chancellor this week must take steps to ensure that businesses can stillthrough the crisis.Among the measures he should consider is a temporary suspension in VAT or employers’ national insurance so firms don’t suddenly run out of cash.He might also introduce a scheme whereby tax payments could be spread out over a longer period.Butthe roots of a retail revival are to go deeper, then the Conservative government will have to embark on genuine reform of business rates, which are currently penalising too many retailers.“Business rates are having a catastrophic effect on the high street. The system we have got at the moment is absolute lunacy,” says Tony Brown, the former chief executive of the retail chain Beales, which is now being closed with the loss of , jobs.As Mr Brown points out, in some cases the rates bill for a Beales store was  times as much as the rent, an unsustainable position.In this second decade of the st century, the Government is meant to be encouraging enterprise, but this mismanaged, unjust system does the exact opposite.As the commercial equivalent of the council tax, the unorm business rate — which is set by central government but collected by local authorities — is a levy paid by companies, supposedly based on the notional rental value of the premises they occupy.But it has become badly distorted by continual tinkering and changes in retail practices.Ministers still like it because it brings in a large amount of revenue, over £billion-a-year, and it is dficult to avoid.But it is riddled with absurdities and inconsistencies.For a start, it bears no relationship to how a retail business is performing.As John Webber, head of ratings at Colliers International global estate services company, puts it, “retailers are paying a disproportionate slice of UK business rate bills, and this burden is based purely on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing.”In addition, it is a tax that punishes high street firms while favouring cyberspace and out-of-town operators with far cheaper premises.In a justiably angry recent outburst, James Daunt, the head of the Watersones book chain, complained that the business rates system is “hollowing out the high street” and shting work “to God-awful warehouses.In a classic example of this destructive bias, the business rates bill for Amazon in  was just £.million, despite UK sales of nearly £.billion.Yet the fashion chain Next, with  stores, had to pay a business rates bill almost £million more than Amazon.The trouble doesnt end there.Businesses with a property of a rateable value of less than £, are eligible for  per cent tax relief, whereas stores with a property value of over £, get no relief at all.In addition, firms can be hurt by transitional relief, which is meant to act like a shock-absorber in gradually phasing in changes in the size of tax bills after any revaluation of properties.Transitional relief might be beneficial when rental values are rising because it gives business ratepayers several years to adjust to increases.But since the last valuation in , retail firms increasingly inhabit a world where commercial rents are falling.Because transitional relief also slows down reductions in bills, this means that many businesses are now paying far more than they really should, given the lower values of their properties.In one branch of Poundland in Blackpool, for example, the business rate should have fallen by  per cent between  and  because of the drop in rental values.Instead, misnamed transitional relief means that by  it will have gone down in real terms by only  per cent.“Transitional relief  I call it comic relief. It needs to be scrapped,” says Poundland’s boss Barry Williams.The Government has tinkered with business rates for years, but all this has achieved is more frustration and complexity.Real reform is needed so that the spirit of enterprise is rewarded rather than punished.Buoyed by their recent election result, the Tories talk about “levelling up the economy” through major infrastructure projects and new transport links.Butthey really want to make an immediate dference, they will focus on helping our high streets.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On housing we have taken a step back, generationally.Whereas my family could be certain of a secure home with a rent we could afford, too many young people today will never know what a stable foundation like that can do for them.A proper home lets people get on with their lives, get their children into a good school, start a business, get involved in the community.These are great British traits that the Conservative Party should be fighting for every day. After all, we created Right To Buy, which has been a great source of stability and mobility for millions, and a triumph of Tory values.However, we now need to reorient the policy so the great opportunities we continue to offer to people with Right To Buy are more than matched by building new social housing to replace what we sell.This is importantwe want to give more people the same chance I had. Shelter recently found there was a net loss of , council houses last year as a result of demolitions and properties sold off through Right To Buy.This is happening while thousands of hard-working families sit on social housing waiting lists, desperate for a shot at the stability they cannot find anywhere .Runaway house prices mean owning your own home has become a distant dream for many lower-paid workers — receptionists, hospital porters, teaching assistants.These hard-working people still deserve a secure home. In the past  years alone house prices in England have grown at twice the pace of wages.The average home increased in value by  per cent between  and , while wages only grew by  per cent.Investing in social housing should be a deeply Conservative ideal. It gives people a  on which to build their lives, to progress and to grow. It is an essential element of a society that values social mobility.After all, it was a Conservative-led council in Liverpool that built the first ever council house as far back as .At last year’s General Election, people up and down the country, many from poorer backgrounds and living in social housing, put their trust in the Conservative Party to deliver for them.If our policies simply continue to provide only expensive new-builds for the already well-off, and almost unaffordable rents for the rest, then people might be left wonderingthat trust was misplaced.By building up our nation’s social housing and ensuring there is sufficient stock of affordable homes, we can give people a chance of a good home and deliver on our promises of fairness and aspiration.There is a world of dference between my childhood home and the grim high-rises that have come to define social housing for many today.But done right, new social housing can create thriving community hubs, minimise crime and be as appealing as new garden villages and towns. You need only to look at Goldsmith Street, the award-winning new development in Norwich, to know this vision is achievable.But warm words alone won’t build good-quality, affordable homes. We need money to build, and the Budget is a chance to signal the party is serious about tackling housing inequality head on.I’ve led a group of  fellow Conservative MPs from across the country and one Conservative metro mayor to call on the Chancellor to let our voters know whose side we are on. We have sent him a letter, an edited version of which is above.Many of us have felt the benefits of social housing in our own lives and we want the next generation to have the same shot at success we did. I hope our new Chancellor listens to our call in his Budget.A secure home lets people get on with their lives, look after their families and grow their businesses without having to worry about damp and draughts damaging their children’s health or a sudden hike in rent ending their dreams.Ensuring this means building up our nation’s offer of social homes. This has been ignored for too many decades. If our policies simply continue to provide only unaffordable housing, the people will never forgive us.However,we are the party that finally delivers the social and other high-quality affordable housing this country needs, they will never forget us.We need the money to build and renovate our available stock, and reform of the planning and laws around land to make it easier to get the social homes built.We believe this year’s Budget is the chance to signal that we will be serious about making this happen.Yours sincerely, DavidOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Callum, a white nought, played by Jack Rowan, has fallen for Masali Baduza’s Sephy, the black daughter of the Home Secretary.This all plays well, obviously, to the self-loathing Empire guilt of the BBC and a lot of middle-class newspapers, who’ve described it as “timely”, “vital” and even claimed: “Noughts + Crosses’ world is our world.”I don’t know what part of Britain they live in where black and white people are banned from holding hands on buses but, lets set aside the show’s political agenda for a moment.The thing about Noughts + Crosses is that, for both technical and artistic reasons, it doesn’t work particularly well as a drama.The story is, of course, as solid as the day William Shakespeare wrote Romeo  Juliet, but the visual problems start with the fact that, because it was filmed in Cape Town, there appears to be a dirty great mountain hovering above what I think is meant to be Tilbury.The obvious climate issue also means poor Helen Baxendale, who plays Callum’s servant mum Maggie, is left with the gear change when she suddenly has to hold up her boss’s dress and say: “Beautul isn’t it . . . and so is the weather.”“Yes, finally some sunshine, You might even catch some colour.”Ker-unch. I’m also not buying the central relationship between Sephy and Callum, which is marked by a distinct lack of sexual chemistry, or the idea he qualied for the elite military school after one weekend on an assault course.The real issue you cannot ignore, however, is the political baggage. If Noughts + Crosses had been screened  or even  years ago, it would’ve been sensational.In , though, TV is overwhelmed by shows and voices telling us everything is racist and sexist, so it just felt and looked like the slowest-moving episode of Doctor Who ever.I find it particularly galling that a lot of those siren voices belong to journalists who I know will be out of a job the day they stop pretending modern-day Britain is really no dferent from Third Reich Germany in .It shouldn’t blind us to our own country’s faults, though.I can, for instance, think of a very prominent British institution that’s had nothing but white, male Director Generals since it was created in .The BBC, though, has always been better at pointing the finger at others rather than itself.So until such time as TV realises less is more, I fully expect Noughts + Crosses to be given awards, acclaim and further series, while a great chunk of television’s weary audience shrugs: “Yeah, everything is racist. We know.”THE heart now sinks every time the lt doors open at The Sex Clinic, on E, and out pops another human horror story like “fabulous fairy” Hugo.His description, not mine. And based on what  I’ve absolutely no idea.But apparently Hugo can have anything up to “three or four men a day”, while he describes his sex le as “very fast-forward”.So I took the hint and skipped through his bits at x speed.The trouble with The Sex Clinic, though, is there’s no light at the end of the tunnel – just more patients like free-wheeling Esther, from Wigan, who shocked me to the core by announcing: “I do not want to jump from d**k to d**k like Tarzan.”’Cos I’d no idea Tarzan was even gay.Although it’s Jane I actually feel sorry for, obviously.Beth England: “Getting on flights brought me back down to earth.”GOOD Morning Britain “megafauna” Piers Morgan: “A lot of people say I look like a young Roger Moore.”BBC continuity: “Now you’re in for a treat. Miriam Margolyes on The One Show.”The Sex Clinic, Esther: “I’d say my sex le is very spontaneous.”Lonely, desolate, unfulfilled, messy, abandoned, solitary, forlorn, a cry for help and all those other things Vanessa Feltz once scrawled on a Celebrity Big Brother table.And why hasn’t Sharon ­listened to Denny’s phone message incriminating Ian  It really would speed this storyline along a bit.WORLD heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury could quite easily have become the most intimidating oaf on the planet.The fact he didn’t and is a surprisingly endearing figure owes something to his continued attachment to home town Morecambe, in Lancashire, and its rubbish disposal unit, which, Tyson explained last Thursday, he faithfully visits “twice a week”, while also taking the car for a mini-valet on a Monday and: “Shaving me head.”It’s a devotion dwarfed only by Tyson’s love for his five children, three of whom are called Prince, and heroic we, Paris, who endures his mood swings and singing with a resolve that would put a few of his opponents to shame.All of which made him the perfect subject for ITV’s fly-on-the-wall documentary Tyson Fury: The Gypsy King, a three-part dream of a series which came to a thrilling and touching conclusion last Thursday, with footage of his win over Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas.Victory was followed by a slightly baffling chorus of American Pie before Tyson grabbed the first available phone to speak to his terrying dad, John, who’d been forced to watch the fight back in England, for GBH-related reasons.Only one question seemed to matter by that stage. “Did I look good on the telly, Dad ” Outstanding, Tyson, son.

Yup, a decade of austerity is well and truly over.His £ billion three point plan to deal with the coronavirus epidemic made it clear the situation is being taken extremely seriously by this government, regardless of what the fake news on social media suggests – and when it comes to the NHS, money is going to be no object. That’s what we want and need to hear right now.Sunak committed a billion pounds for the financial security of vulnerable members of the public during the emergency as he tries to rebrand the Tories as the “real party for the workers”.And he took the “signicant step” of providing statutory sick pay paid for by the government for small businesses for those off work for up to  days.No one was left out of his plans to cut business rates to zero to deal with the crisis – with everything from music venues to hotels covered. And the small businesses most in need will receive an extra £, cash injection.This was a package to save our economy in the short term. It’s hard to argue with the chancellor when he says it’s one of the most comprehensive fiscal stimulus packages anywhere in the world.But what about the psychological impact of financial stress on iniduals  I’m delighted he has also asked the HMRC to delay payments over time for those struggling in the wake of this very unexpected crisis.As for the Tories plans to level up, there was a spending spree too.The continued freeze on fuel duty – a campaign led by The Sun for the past decade that I have taken up on my talkRADIO show too – was a welcome dose of common sense that will help iniduals, businesses and public services.A freeze on alcohol duty should be celebrated too, as should the abolishment of the hated tampon tax.But much more signicant was Sunak’s vow to “unleash the power of business”, with support for new bold ideas – a Dominic Cummings’ passion project – given special funding.And the infrastructure spend is incredibly signicant too with Sunak’s vow: “If the country needs it we will build it.”From  million potholes being filled to transforming transport systems north of Newcastle, critics will find it hard to say Sunak didn’t do enough. Although that’s predictably how Labour immediately responded.But this will go down as the coronavirus budget.And perhaps the most important factor is that I believed Mr Sunak when he said the government will do whatever it takes to protect our country and our most vulnerable people during what is going to be a very rough few weeks and months ahead.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tory finance chief turned the spending taps to ‘gushing’ as he laid out what experts called the biggest giveaway Budget since . There are some restrictions on entrepreneurs and a tax hike on EU nationals.But mostly it’ll be funded by an explosion in borrowing - the exact thing the Tories slammed Labour for doing during the  financial crisis.With all those big picture measures, and the fear of the COVID- virus, it’s easy to miss the small print of the -page Budget document and how it will hit you. So as a public service we’ve gone through it with a fine-toothed comb - and picked out an awkward  things the Chancellor may well prefer you not to read. This first one is actually not from the government - it’s from their budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsiiblity. “Historically, the chance of the economy falling into recession at some point in a five-year period is roughly one-in-two,” they say. “But a recession this year is quite possiblethe spread of coronavirus causes widespread economic disruption.”  Unions sounded the alarm after the Budget was used to launch a review of the Retail Prices Indexmeasure of inflation. The government claims RPI has “shortcomings” in how it’s measured and has proposed aligning it with the lower CPIH rate after February . But the higher RPI is used to calculate many people’s pension payments and pay uprating, according to the GMB union. So removing it will mean a hit to future payments. GMB general secretary Tim Roache warned: “These proposals will be a hammer blow for millions of working people and pensioners. This might be presented as a technical issue butthis goes through it will end up costing millions of workers and pensioners their full, hard-earned compensation. . Millions of EU nationals will be whacked with a £ NHS charge - raking in £.billion  The Budget confirms the Immigration Health Surcharge for non-Brits using the NHS will explode from £ to £ per year. And crucially it will be extended to more than million EU nationals who live in the UK from  - even those who work in the NHS or pay taxes in this country. We knew this would happen from the Tory manesto. What’s new, however, is the sheer size of the tax grab from EU nationals. Overall the Treasury is planning to cream off £.bn in extra Immigration Health Surcharge over five years, from   to  . There will be a discounted rate for children, but it’ll still be £ per year. . Universal Credit may only be fully rolled out in   Again, this is from the OBR watchdog and not the government. But it’s important.Last month, the government admitted it had pushed back the rollout of Universal Credit again and it would only end in September .Yet it’s been delayed more than seven times. And now there have been so many delays, the OBR has decided to just assume it will only finish in September . “Our decision to erge more materially from DWP’s plans reflects both the accumulated experience of the past seven years,” the OBR said drily. “And the greater emphasis on taking things slowly to protect claimants.” . The poorest people will gain less than middle earners  A little-noticed ‘distributional analysis’ in the Budgetshows the poorest % of households will gain between £ and £ per year. But while nothing like the bad old austerity days, that’s still less than the benefit to nearly everyone . Only the top % are benefiting less. The analysis, produced by the Treasury, shows the impact of tax and benefit changes in   from both the  Spending Round and the  Budget. . Vulnerable families will face a £ ‘Boiler Tax’  Blink and you’d miss it, but the Chancellor briefly said “from April  I’m freezing the levy on electricity and raising it on gas.” Raising it on gas, eh  So what does that mean  The small print shows he was talking about a consultation on a Green Gas Levy, a tax on gas suppliers in order to fund the production of bio-methane. Treasury officials told The Times it would cost £ per household per year initially, rising to £ per year by . But the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health warned it was deeply worrying. Chief executive Anne Godfrey said: By freezing electricity costs and increasing the cost of gas, the Chancellor is effectively making energy more expensive for everyone. The plan to increase the levy on gas is deeply worrying and we urge the Government to clary their intentions and outline how they will support those living in fuel poverty. . There’s a massive percentage tax rise on rolling tobacco  Given how bad they are for us - and the NHS - you’d expect cigarettes to see a tax hike. But the duty on roll-ups, used by some of the most skint smokers, is rising by far more than that on ordinary cigarettes. For most tobacco products it’s RPI inflation plus % for hand-rolling tobacco it’s RPI plus %. . Tories have handed a £.bn tax break to £, earners  A reeeeeeally complicated pensions change will help the NHS - but at the cost of giving £, earners a tax break. Basically, doctors had warned they were refusing overtime shts because they were being pushed over into a dferent set of pension rules. The current system meanspeople earn £ over a £k threshold, they are classed under a completely new set of rules for calculating their income to decide what tax relief theyaposll get on their pension. The rules are pretty simplepeople are definitely in one system or the other. But because doctors’ average salary is £k they didn’t know which system they were in. Treasury officials were looking at raising the £, threshold to £,. Now they’ve gone even further and raised it to £, from next month. But the relief will apply to everyone, not just doctors. And the small print shows it will deprive the Treasury of £.bn over five years. . There’s no mention of where tampon tax funding will go  Since  the money raised by the hated % VAT charge on tampons and sanitary towels, which couldnapost be abolished while the UK was in the EU, has been used to fund a charity pot for womenaposs groups. Since its creation, £million has been awarded by the fund to projects that help disadvantaged and vulnerable women across the UK. But now the Budget makes no mention of where that money will go. Women’s Budget Group Director Mary-Ann Stephenson said: “We welcome the removal of the tampon tax, but the Chancellor said nothing about what would replace it as a source of funding for violence against women and girls services, which it is estimated need £ million a year.” . Brexit is taking a massive hit to the British economy  Boris Johnson ’s Brexit will slow down economic growth to the tune of £, for every person in the country, the government’s spending watchdog has said.Brexit appeared just twice in Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s first Budget speech despite the huge impact it’s predicted to have on the national finances. The Office for Budget Responsibilitysaid based on current Brexit plans, growth would be slowed by around % in the long run. They said part of the slowdown was a result of lower migration - but most was from a slump in business investment. The body - set up by George Osborne to scrutinise Budgets - said the economy had only seen a third of the impact of Brexit so far. Another third will happen over the next five years, and the remainder after . And... The Tories’ new immigration system will hurt economic growth The OBR watchdog also warns the Tories’ Brexit immigration system will take a hit to GDP. The salary cap of £, will leave GDP .% smaller than it would have been in  . In fairness, though, the OBR also says this wouldn’t be a signicant change compared to other factors, some of which also involve Brexit. . That £bn in infrastructure spending  Most of it was already announced  The Budget goes on about a £bn infrastructure fund which, by any stretch of the imagination, sounds very very impressive. But actually £bn was announced in the Tory manesto, and the £bn figure is a “gross” total. The actual figure is still big, but a lot less so.  . That £m for rough sleepers  £m of it was already announced Chancellor Rishi Sunak boasted of £million to tackle rough sleeping. But when you break it down, it’s not quite as impressive. £million of it for , rough sleepers’ accommodation was already announced previously by Boris Johnson. The further money is £m for “associated support services” abd £m for drug and alcohol abuse treatment. .

Todayaposs Budget - the first in  months - announced a shake-up in benefits and sick pay rules and a stimulus for businesses like pubs and music venues to deal with a slowdown from COVID-. Fuel duty was frozen for the th year in a row with no rises to taxes on beer, wine, spirits or cider. And National Insurance contributions will be cut, saving middle and higher earners £ a year. The Chancellor said £bn would go on measures to tackle Coronavirus, plus another £bn of fiscal loosening to help the economy more generally - a £bn total. There was also money for the environment, including a new plastics tax.  He promised extra funds for broadband, road building and further education. But inborrowing per year will almost DOUBLE per year by  - driving a coach and horses through a decade of failed Tory pledges to rebalance the economy after the Labour years. And a sting in the tail includes a tax on gas suppliers that could see household bills rise by £ a year.

Another third will happen over the next five years, and the remainder after .In their assessment of Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s first budget, the OBR said: “Real business investment has barely grown since the referendum, whereas our March  forecast assumed it would have risen more than % by now. “We expect this shortfall to be partly reversed as the specics of the trading relationship are claried, hence reducing uncertainty. “But, working in the other direction, we expect the adverse effect of higher trade barriers to build through our five-year forecast period and beyond.” The so-called “Brexit idend” is also listed in the Budget red book as a benefit to the economy.  The figure amounts to £. billion a year by  - more or less the £ million a week written on the side of Boris Johnson ’s bus, less the ‘rebate’ from the EU. Meanwhile, the coronavirus outbreak may delay the next round of Brexit talks between the UK and the EU, Downing Street has said. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Talks remain scheduled to go ahead next week but clearly we will keep the situation under review and we will be guided by the scientic advice.

Visitors to Wood Norton are now being limited to keep the facility clean and prevent the risk of it becoming infected, according to a source. London-based workers rely heavily on public transport, where the threat of contracting the disease is deemed greater. But Wood Norton has no public transport links, meaning it is easier to keep the site free of the virus. The source said staff already based at Wood Norton “have the skills and capacity to do what London control rooms do”.

Yet there is no doubt this Budget is a sht in gears by the Conservatives.

An apology that didn’t work was noticeably missing, leech doctor bloodsucking deflating wages and growth while inflating national debt over the lost decade. Had the Tories applied a coronavirus-style financial blood transfusion after the banking collapse instead of raising VAT by a record £-billion and scything investment, we’d all be better off.

The Chancellor’s decision to splash the cash was forced in part by the coronavirus crisis.Yet his spree was also an acknowledgement Labour was right to argue you need investment to stimulate growth and protect jobs. We withhold judgement on whether his package of measures to help Britain weather the Covid- threat is sufficient. While support for staff and small firms is welcome there was not nearly enough to help the self-employed and gig economy workers.  It was also troubling that the Chancellor had nothing to say on social care, childcare or the funding crisis in local government.The extra investment in the NHS and further education was long overdue, as was the money to remove cladding from high-rise buildings. So many measures announced yesterday should and could have come years earlier. The Chancellor spoke of levelling up yet this remained a fundamentally Tory Budget in many respects. Even the Treasury’s own analysis showed the losers were the poorest %.  Mr Sunak has to deliver on his ambitious plans. Voters have heard talk of getting things done – now they want to see action that will improve communities, hospitals and schools. To listen to the Chancellor, you would not believe his party had been in power since . For all his emphasis on this being a Budget by a new government at the start of the new decade, he cannot wash his hands of responsibility for what happened in the past  years. This was a confident debut but the Chancellor yet he knows his plans could hit the rocks of coronavirus and Brexit.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced today that among the governmentaposs new measures there will be £million spent on repairing potholes, business rates discount to protect pubs, and beer, wine, cider and spirits duties will also be frozen. There will also be a % retail discount on business rates to protect hotels, pubs and guest houses. Minimum Income Floor in Universal Credit will also be temporarily removed but the government failed to announce measures that will directly tackle growing child poverty numbers. Alison Garnham, Chief Executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: When it comes to the nation’s longer-term priorities, action on poverty must trump potholes and pubs. We need to properly re-invest in our social infrastructure. Have you been affected by this story Email  webnews@mirror The temporary lting of the Minimum Income Floor in Universal Credit is very welcome, but to be effective, a plan for prosperity must include fixes to the fundamental design flaws and funding shortfalls that have left universal credit unfit for purpose. “Universal credit continues to cause havoc for millions so it is disappointing that the Chancellor brought no substantial permanent reforms to the table today. “It is within the Government’s power to spread opportunity more evenly across the UK and to enable struggling families to get on, but unless funding is restored for universal credit and for children’s benefits, investment in infrastructure will have limited effects. This Budget was an opportunity to begin to slow the rise in child poverty but there was no evidence today that low incomes are the priority that they should be in any effective strategy to level up the country and boost the economy. Since the Tories came to power in  child poverty has soared by more half a million from . million to . million. The Daily Mirror is calling on the government to raise child benefit by £ a week to end of child poverty. A £-a-week increase would mean families gain £ a year on average and lt , children out of poverty. In addition the benefit cap has left , single parents worse off as it limits the amount families can receive to £. a weekthey live in London and £. in the rest of the country.  Ms Garnham said: The Government could lt , children from poverty by it restored support for children in Universal Credit to its  value, added £ to child benefit and removed the two-child limit and benefit cap. That would begin to level up those children and to send a strong signal to struggling families that they have not been forgotten.” End Child Poverty, a coalition of more than  charities, Unions, faith groups, professional bodies and community groups is dismayed that the Chancellor has not done more to loosen the grip of poverty on . million children in the UK. Anna Feuchtwang, Chair of the End Child Poverty coalition and Chief Executive of the National Children’s Bureau said: We welcome the Chancellor’s actions on the benefits system to help the most vulnerable during the Coronavirus crisis.  * Read more about our  Give Me Five campaign However, low income families could be forgiven for thinking that they are simply not part of the Government’s long term plan for prosperity for this nation. This budget was an opportunity, with ambitious policymaking, to set a course of action to end child poverty. It is not right that growing up in poverty restricts and restrains children’s everyday lives and their futures. Their chances of prospering are unjustly much less that their peers. Yet this is the reality for . million children – the majority from working households. In addition to increases to the national living wage and reductions to National Insurance, working families need: benefits to keep pace with inflation and private rents an end to the five week wait for Universal Credit and an end to the two-child limit. And we are disappointed that there has been no increase in child benefit, which the Mirror has been campaigning for. Sadly, without an explicit commitment to end child poverty this isn’t a budget that will mean prosperity for all.  The Chancellor also said in response to the coronavirus crisis statutory sick pay will become available for any advised to self isolate - eventhey haven’t presented with symptoms. A move welcomed by Ms Garnham but she called for more support for people on Universal Credit who have been forced to self-isolate. “The new coronavirus emergency measures on Statutory Sickness Pay, employment support allowance and universal credit are welcome but low-income families need support in health and in sickness, she said. “It is critical that universal credit payments are made available immediately on a non-repayable basis to anyone self-isolating who needs to claim.” In Poplar and Limehouse % of children are living in poverty making the east London constituency the child poverty capital in the country.

Emma Revie, Chief Executive of the Trussell Trust, warned that Brits living in poverty face an “unprecedented challenge” as the COVID- outbreak leads to empty supermarkets and stockpiling.A spokesperson for the trust, which has  food banks in its network, told  Mirror  that while   food banks will continue to provide the leline of emergency food - “what this could look like in the coming weeks is hard for us to say at this stage”.  The stark warning came as the number of people in the UK to be diagnosed with the virus jumped up by  to  and some food banks started to run out of basics and are rationing out parcels. Ms Revie said it is possible that food banks will face increased demand at a time when donations may drop and volunteers become unavailable due to the strict rules that are being enforced to stop further spread of the virus. And she encouraged people to drop off vital items at their nearest food bank - after checking what is running low. She said: “Time and again over the past decade, food banks across the UK – aided by a generous public who have donated time, food and money – have stepped up to protect people on the lowest incomes in our communities. But with the spread of coronavirus we all now face an unprecedented challenge and uncertain future. It is possible that food banks will face increased demand as people lose income, at the same time as food donations drop or staff and volunteers are unavailable, due to measures rightly put in place to slow the spread of infection. All of this comes when food banks are already dealing with a record level of need for emergency food.”  The Trussell Trust charity handed out a record , three-day emergency food parcels in the six months to September - a % rise on the previous year. Low income was the primary reason for % of referrals followed by benefit delays , benefit changesand debt . Ms Revie added:“We’re working with our network on how best to support people as the situation unfolds.

The red tape around the door makes it crystal clear that this is a high contamination zone. I am in Flucamp, where  human guinea pigs will be willingly infected with a strain of coronavirus in the coming months. The Mirror has gained exclusive access to the facility, which could play a vital role in the fight against Covid- by helping create a vaccine or anti-viral drugs. Triallists can earn between £,-£,. Tens of thousands of volunteers have already applied. “This is a critical step to fast-track development of these anti-virals and vaccines,” explains Dr Andrew Catchpole, chief scientist at Hvivo which runs the facility. “We’re trying to use our expertise in this area to see what we can do.” Volunteers will not be infected with Covid-, but with “harmless” strains of the coronavirus – OC and E – which will cause a very mild respiratory illness. The aim is to safely expose them to “close relatives” of the deadly strain, helping pharmaceutical firms test potential vaccines. Dr Catchpole added: “If it can work on our virus, there’s no reason why it can’t work with Covid-.” Cathal Friel, executive chairman of Hvivo’s owner Open Orphan, added: “The company is starting the process of developing the world’s first coronavirus challenge study model – basically, we take a harmless version of the virus that we can use and monitor. “This is a British company which is the world centre for virology.” Hvivo, which has been running clinical trials on flu and cold viruses since , has seen an unprecedented , apply for coronavirus tests at its site in Whitechapel, East London.  But the odds of being suitable are -. Only  to -year-olds are even considered and smokers are immediately ruled out. Dr Catchpole said: “We want very healthy iniduals so we can be sure that the disease that’s given is controlled. Then they come in and have a blood sample. We’re testing for pre-existing immunity. We’ve all been exposed to family members of the coronavirus, we’ve all got some levels of immunity. “We need to screen people so we’re only giving the virus to those who would get sick. That can eliminate up to % of subjects.”For those who clear that hurdle, lungand livertests follow. Dr Catchpole said: “If you get through, participants would be invited back in for quarantine.” A month before quarantine begins, half of the group will be given a potential Covid- vaccine – currently in development by a third party. The other % will get a placebo. One month later, all are infected with a “lesser” virus via a nasal spray before being confined to one of the ft by ft rooms, only half of which have windows, for  days.Staff in blue scrubs, gloves and ventilators will come in several times a day to take nasal swabs and other routine tests. Gruesomely, the amount of mucus produced by participants is weighed daily. Dr Catchpole explained: “When you have a cold you need to blow your nose, it’s an effective measure of the level of symptoms someone has. “So we provide them with pre-weighed tissues so we know the weight of the tissue at the start and they have a sealed bag which they put used tissues in.” Meals will be delivered on a tray by staff wearing ventilators and other protective gear. Access to TV, games consoles, wi-fi, and a few home comforts help ease the boredom of two weeks’ solitary confinement. Site manager Laura Krizman said: “They’re encouraged to bring laptops, books, students bring projects. Some brought teddy bears, cuddly things.” All personal belongings are decontaminated at the end of the trial. Surprisingly given all that, ex-triallists have left rave reviews on Flucamp’s website.

And those living in north London, Torbay, Devon and parts of Hampshire are feared to be most susceptible at the moment. These areas have had the most confirmed cases in the UK. Six people have died so far after being diagnosed with Covid- in the UK, reports Devon Live . However, coronavirus has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation. For updates on the coronavirus outbreak,  read our live blogPHEaposs useful tool shows that, of am on March , , there were  cases confirmed in the capital. A further  had been recorded in the southeast of England, and  people had been infected in the southwest. There had been some  cases recorded in the northwest of England. A further  were recorded across the Midlands. As a result, the NHS in England will ramp up testing facilities so , more coronavirus tests can be performed each day.  Professor Dame Sue Hill, NHS chief scientic officer, said: “The NHS is ramping up the number of testing centres across the country, to help people get care quickly or have their mind put at ease. “England’s NHS has world-leading expertise and every hospital across the country, and the healthcare professionals who run them, are now actively planning to respond flexibly to manage new demand. “The public can help us to help the country to stay safe by practising good hygiene and washing their hands more often, for at least  seconds.”  Now local hospital labs will join specialist services, including those already provided by PHE, in being able to accurately detect the presence of the new virus. Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, added: “Wider testing is important as it allows us to continue to meet demand as the number of people being tested increases in the coming weeks. This will ensure that PHE and the NHS have the most robust system possible to understand what is happening with the virus.

Even with a cold it takes a few weeks to get rid of it. She goes blue and gets breathless. Iaposm not so worried about myself, but for Kyra itaposs really scary.

Schools across the country were put on alert tonight that they might need to shut their doors for a fortnight, the Mirror can reveal. The nationwide coronavirus closures could come into effect on March  - weeks before the traditional Easter break. It would mean youngsters spending a month out of the classroom and create a childcare nightmare for working parents. Follow our coronavirus live blog for the latest updates Another plan being considered is shortening the Easter break by a week and scrapping the May half-term. But this would create havoc with families who have already booked trips away during the traditional holidays. Teachers have been told the ‘home-learning packs’ must be ready to send out by Friday. But sources said any enforced closure would almost certainly not take place until the end of next week. The packs include coursework for GCSE and A-Level students and curriculum-based learning for younger children. Schools are also busy compiling lists of children who have access to the internet at home. The plan is for work to be set via online education s that pupils can log-on to remotely. Workers are also expected to go into schools during the shutdown to perform ‘deep cleans’.  One teacher said: “We have had guidance from our head of the academy who has been told to expect at least a week-long closure, possibly two. “If schools are closed from mid-March, it wouldn’t make sense to open them up again so close to Easter. We’re preparing for a month at home. “The home-learning packs have to be all ready by this Friday, with the aim of sending them home with the kids the following Friday.” Another teacher at a school in the north of England said they had been ordered to get emergency plans underway.  They told the Mirror: “We have been told an extended Easter break is a very real possibilitythe virus spread continues at the predicted rate. “We are now preparing for that eventuality. But this will not mean two weeks’ extra holiday. “Schools in our local authority area - both primary and secondary – are drawing up plans for children to be given lessons at home.

The newly married police officer, , suffered catastrophic injuries after trying to stop three teenagers stealing a quad bike on August  last year. The Old Bailey today heard how the Thames Valley police constable desperately flailed his arms like a rag doll after he became tangled in a loading strap attached to their getaway car. They allegedly dumped the £, bike but pulled PC Harper, who had become trapped around the ankles, for over a mile after roaring down Lambdens Hill, a country lane in Bradfield Southend, Bekshire. The officer who was with him, PC Andrew Shaw, likened the moment he was dragged away by the SEAT vehicle to when a water-skier loses his footing and is whipped forward before landing on his back.  Driver Henry Long, , allegedly swerved from side to side in an attempt to free the officer, causing him to hit hedgerows and other items in the lane. Prosecuting, Brian Altman, QC described how two of PC Harperaposs colleagues, both police dog handlers, were waiting in their cars at the A junction after being alerted to what had happened. One of them, PC Andrew Kemp, described coming across his fellow officeraposs body - which by then had been stripped naked - in Ufton Lane. As the SEAT crossed the A, PC Kemp saw what he thought was strapping trailing from the vehicle, and, as he turned into Ufton Lane, he saw what he thought were ratchet straps in the road, Mr Altman said. To his right he saw out of the corner of his eye something moving and tumbling in the road. At the same time, he heard on the radio a message from his colleague PC Christopher Bushnell, the other dog unit, who had driven ahead of him, that there was a body from the car or thrown from the car. While PC Christopher Bushnell gave chase in a Mitsubishi Outlander, PC Kemp pulled over and got out of his car. He described his injuries [as] utterly catastrophic injuries. Another colleague, PC Katherine Darling, who had responded to a radio call for assistance, described seeing blood which was bright red and running all the way down the centre of the road on tarmac.

It was an embarrassing blow for the Duke of Sussex, , who, along with we Meghan Markle and baby son Archie, will officially quit their roles as senior royals at the end of March. In an astonishing recording, Harry spoke to the fake Greta about his uncle Prince Andrew, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his frequent flying, his belief that the world is run by some very sick people and his battle with the media.He was tricked by notorious Russian pranksters Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov, who are reported to have called Harry on New Yearaposs Eve and January  while the Sussexes were staying in Canada. Kuznetsov and Stolyarov posted the recording on social media, providing more embarrassing headlines for a Royal Family in crisis.They posed as Swedish climate change activist Greta, , and her father Svante, the Sun reported.The hoaxersapos previous victims include music legend Elton John and US Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. The calls involving Harry emerged after he and Meghan attended their final royal engagement - Mondayaposs Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey in central London. Here are some of the highlights of the calls.Harry on quitting royal le The duke opened up to the fake Greta about his reasons for quitting senior royal le, saying he is withdrawing to protect my son. He told the Russians: “It’s, that’s probably a conversation for another time, there’s lots of layers to it and lots of pieces to the puzzle. “But sometimes the right decision isn’t always the easy one. “And this decision certainly wasn’t the easy one but it was the right decision for our family, the right decision to be able to protect my son.  “And I think there’s a hell of a lot of people around the world that can identy and respect us for putting our family first. “But, yeah, it’s a tricky one, but we will start a new le.” He also joked: “I can assure you, marrying a prince or princess is not all it’s made up to be.” aposNo one has stripped us of our titlesapos The fake Greta and Svante prodded Harry about reports that he and Meghan, , had been stripped of their royal titles. Harry replied: “No. Again, you mustn’t believe what you read, no one has stripped us of our titles. “Because of a technicality within the family,we are earning money separately from within the family structure, then we obviously have been asked not to use our titles in order to make money, which we would never do. “But the press managed to jump on that to make it look like we had been stripped.” Harry on Donald Trump  Harry was also pressed for his opinion on Donald Trump. During one call, he said: I think the mere fact that Donald Trump is pushing the coal industry is so big in America, he has blood on his hands. aposGretaapos told the duke that the US President had run away from her, referring to the time Trump refused to be pictured with the real activist. Harry told aposGretaapos: “What a surprise.  He told the aposteenapos that she would outsmart Trump in a conversation about climate change, but she should always meet him when the opportunity presents itself.Harry, who met Trump at an event in London after the president called Meghan nasty, said: “Whether you have an option to meet President Trump or an option to meet Boris Johnson, I think I would always.Harry on Prince Andrew  During one of the calls, the discussion moved to Prince Andrewaposs friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Harry said: “I have very little to say on that. “But whatever he has done or hasn’t done, is completely separate from me and my we. We operate in a way of inclusivity and we are focusing on community. And so we are completely separate from the majority of my family.” Harry on Boris Johnson  It appears Harry has a more favourable opinion of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He told the fake daughter and father: “I think he is a good man, so you are one of few people who can reach into his soul and get him to feel and believe in you. “But you have to understand that because he has been around for so long like all of these other people, they are already set in their ways. “They believe what they want to believe, they believe what they have been told. “What you are now saying to them is not only inconvenient but is completely against everything they have ever believed. “So that is what you’re up against, up against changing habits, as you know.” UK political system aposbrokenapos  Harry also weighed in on last Decemberaposs election, which gave the Prime Minister an overwhelming majority. He said: The fact that our choice was between those two iniduals in my mind, I think, probably creates more of an observation that the system itself might be broken. Thereaposs a lot that the leaders of today can learn and can listen to people like yourself. Harry on his future in private le The Duke of Sussex also opened up on his future and plans for his own projects. He said he and Meghan decided against starting their own foundation because we don’t think the world needs necessarily another foundation from us.  With a hell of a lot of money being passed around the world, Harry said they are taking some time to consider starting an organisation to bring people together. Harry on Greta Prince Harry gushed over the real Gretaaposs work during one of the phone calls and said extreme action was needed to combat climate change.He told the fake Greta: “I’ve spent many, many years being criticised by the media for doing all sorts of things and trying to change the way we think, and I can sympathise but at the same time applaud the work that all of you are doing because it’s not an easy time and the world is a troubled place and can be very easy to give up and I think what you guys are doing absolutely remarkable. “Unfortunately the world is being led by some very sick people, so people like yourselves and younger generation are the ones that are going to make all the dference.” Normal le aposbetter than royal leapos  The fake Svante askednormal le was worse than royal le. “You forget, I was in the military for ten years so I’m more normal than my family would like to believe. “But certainly being in a dferent position now gives us the ability to say things and do things that we might not have been able to do. “And seeing as everyone under the age of  or , seems to be carrying out an activist’s role, gives us the opportunity to try and make more of a dference without being criticised . Harry laughed as he replied: “Oh no, I think it’s much better. Harry on criticism over his private jet flights The duke dismissed criticism over his use of private jets. He said: Unfortunately, there is very few alternatives. We have to fly on commercial planes all over the world. Nowhere near as much as most people who do it for a night or weekends. Certainly for my family, to protect my family, from these people, as you can well understand.

Hand holding, stolen kisses and, in many cases, heartbreak when theyaposre still teenagers. And for Mary Baker, she was certain she had met her soulmate when she was still a schoolgirl. She was just  when Royce Plyers moved to the small town of Bantry in West Cork, Ireland - and she was instantly smitten. Mary explained: One beautul day a new guy moved to town with his family. He was tall and dark haired, with a cheeky smile and a lovely Welsh English accent. His name was Royce Plyer and he was the same age as me. My friends and I took a shine to him immediately. I was attending school in Dublin at the time. So every time I came home at the weekend, we all hung out together and went out to the local discos.  He never went out with any of the girls in our area, but not for want of them trying. Heartbreakingly, Mary thought she wasnapost good enough for Royce but was happy to be his friend. Then, one night in June , at the local disco, while they were dancing to David Bowieaposs Letaposs Dance, Royce asked Mary a question she would never forget. She explained: I was sitting and chatting with Royce when a song, that is now etched on my brain.  Laughing and joking, Royce came closer and said, aposMary  If I kiss you, would you hit me apos My reply  aposWhy don’t you try it and find out apos So he did. In case you are wondering, no I didn’t hit him. I kissed him back. Mary and Royce became a couple and their friends and family were delighted. Mary said: I had found a great guy who respected me, was kind, gentle, trust worthy, polite and heaps of fun. A really special guy. For two years, the cople were very much in love but then fate dealt them a devastating blow. Heartbroken, Royce had to tell Mary that his family were moving back to the UK - with just  hours notice. He bought his childhood sweetheart a Claddagh ring, which is an old Irish wedding ring. Mary said: It signies love, loyalty and friendship. I wore it around my neck on a long chain. We couldn’t bear to leave each other and made plans to be together when I had finished school. The couple kept in touch as often as they could but this was in the days before mobile phones and the internet, so they were limited to letters and expensive landline calls. Finally, they met up for a weekend in Manchester - it would be the last tie thet wiykd see each other for the next  years. Both married other people, had children and seemed to be getting on with their lives apart - but neither forgot the other. Mary said: I used to tell my friends how I lost the love of my le and talked about him all the time.  Royce was constantly watching Irish registered cars, on the off chance it was me inside or spotting people that looked similar to me on the street.  But the years went by and we never bumped into each other. I went to other s and wrote to radio stations and newspapers to try to find him but alas no joy.Finally, with the advent of Facebook , the pair had a chance to reconnect - and Mary went to incredible s to find her first love.She said: To my surprise, there were more Royce Plyers in the world than just mine.  So they all got a message from me in the hope that one of them was the love of my le. And then silence … silence for two long years. On August , , at exactly .pm, as I ed to the sitting room, coffee in hand, I glanced at my phone on the table and saw a message that would change our lives forever. Royce had finally replied with aposhi, sorry have only just seen this message . Yes I lived in Bantry and we went out togetherapos. Mary dropped her coffee in shock and instantly replied aposis that really you apos. The messages carried on every day and Mary admitted it felt asthe couple had never been apart. Mary said: It emerged that neither of us had been happy for a long time and I was at the latter end of my orce.  We decided to meet each other again, that October I flew from Cork to Bristol, on an Aer Lingus flight where I had told one of the air hostesses my story.  I was keen to look my best and needed to doll myself up. She allowed me to commandeer the bathroom.  Unbeknownst to me, she primed the other passengers and on my exit all I heard was a chorus of The Rose of Tralee.  I was so excited – I could not find my suitcase fast enough and get out to the arrivals hall.  Meanwhile, as Royce waited, he could not understand why the passengers were all pointing and staring at him as they passed by. Mary finally got through the airport and ran into Royceaposs arms. They spent the next five days together, which she said confirmed the couple should be together. Royce moved to Ireland the following November and the couple, both now , started their new le together. But that was far from the end of their journey. Mary said: As we reconnected we discovered that we both had the same dream of living abroad.  "},{"url":null,"title":"cheeky boy makes 9 charging","story":"NewsCheeky boy makes £ charging kids to use his hand sanitiser - but school isnt impressedA mum has gone viral on social media after explaining why her teenage son was sent home from school rather early on Wednesday morningShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News-year-old Oliver Cooper charged his friends to use his hand sanitiser \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Some of the hotels on the Spanish island are expected to remain closed until June.  While there are only ten confirmed cases of coronavirus in Majorca, the holiday destination has been hit hard by punters fearful of the disease. The Hotel Chain Association announced that there had been more cancellations than reservations on the Balearic island. The low occupancy rates are expected to continue for the next five or six weeks. The organisation said that all hotels with less than % of beds filled would close. Those booked into the beleaguered institutions would be moved to hotels that remain open. The president of ACH, Gabriel Llobera, told the Olive Press : The low sales levels are unlikely to change in the next two weeks, so the Balearic Islands and other holiday will be affected at Easter. The cancellation of a high profile medical event is also likely to hurt business on the island. The XV Congress of the Spanish Society of Glaucoma has been called off, meaning  ophthalmologists will not longer be heading to Majorca.  The coronavirus spread across the world is predicted to have a huge financial impact on the tourist industry.

Declaring Covid- a apospandemicapos and expressing major concerns of the levels of aposinactionapos by governments across the globe, WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added that the tide can be turned on the deadly coronavirus. The WHO chief said several countries had shown it can be suppressed and controlled but questioned whether all had the resolve to do what was required. The doctor called on countries to take a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach, built around a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact. He summarised it in four key areas:Prepare and be ready. Detect, protect and treat. Reduce transmission. Innovate and learn.Dr Ghebreyesus said: All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic  social disruption and respecting human rights. WHO’s mandate is public health. But we’re working with many partners across all sectors to mitigate the social and economic consequences of this Covid- pandemic. Every person in the world, and every sector of society, must join the fight against Covid-, said Dr Ghebreyesus. He described it as not not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector. He added: We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace, and mobilize their people in the response, those with a handful of Covid- cases can prevent those cases becoming clusters, and those clusters becoming community transmission. Sounding a final not of optimism, Dr Ghebreyesus said beating the deadly virus was doable. He said: I remind all countries that we are calling on you to ready your hospitals, and protect and train your healthworkers. Let’s all look out for each other.  There’s been so much attention on one word. Let me give you some other words that matter much more, and that are much more actionable: Prevention. Preparedness. Public health. Political leadership. And most of all, People. We’re in this together, to do the right things with calm and protect the citizens of the world. It’s doable. Meanwhile in the UK, health secretary Matt Hancock has been speaking in the House of Commons this evening. He said Parliament will be kept open.  Mr Hancock said: “This afternoon the World Health Organisation declared coronavirus a global pandemic. I’ve spoken to the leader of the House and we have had discussions Mr Speaker, and we have resolved that we will keep Parliament open. “Of course, in some ways this House may have todferently, but the ability to hold the Government to account and to legislate are as vital in a time of emergency as in normal times - our democracy is the foundation of our way of le.” He added that the Government will continue to work closely with Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, the Lord Speaker and the authorities in both Houses in the coming days and weeks. Mr Hancock added: “As the leader of the House said in business questions last week the public will expect Parliament to sit and to get on with its job. Our approach will be guided by the best scientic evidence and medical advice and we will take all necessary measures to deal with this outbreak.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus world health organisations full","story":"NewsCoronavirus: World Health Organisations full statement as Covid- declared pandemicChief of the World Health Organisation Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called for countries and iniduals to step up in the fight against the Covid- disease which is caused by coronavirusShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video world-health-organisation-class-coronavirus-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news coronavirus-world-health-organisations-full-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the blunt admission that the Covid- form of the coronavirus should now be characterized as a pandemic. By the organisations own definition, a pandemic is defined as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”. Dr Tedros said: In the past two weeks, the number of cases of Covid- outside China has increased -fold and the number of affected countries has tripled. There are now more than , cases in  countries and , people have lost their lives. Thousands more are fighting for their lives in hospitals. In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of Covid- cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries climb even higher. WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made the assessment that Covid- can be characterized as a pandemic. Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that,misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustied acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.  Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO’s assessment of the threat posed by this coronavirus It doesn’t change what WHO is doing, and it doesn’t change what countries should do. We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. And we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time. WHO has been in full response mode since we were notied of the first cases. We have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear.As I said on Monday, just looking at the number of Covid- cases and the number of countries affected does not tell the full story. Of the , Covid- cases reported globally in  countries, more than  percent of cases are in just four countries, and two of those – China and South Korea - have signicantly declining epidemics.  countries have not reported any Covid- cases, and  countries have reported  cases or less. We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace, and mobilize their people in the response, those with a handful of Covid- cases can prevent those cases becoming clusters, and those clusters becoming community transmission. “Even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide on this coronaviru.  Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled. The challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large Covid- clusters or community transmission is not whether they can do the same – it’s whether they will. “Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resources. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve. We are grateful for the measures being taken in Iran, Italy and South Korea ro slow the virus and control their Covid- epidemics. We know that these measures are taking a heavy toll on societies and economies, just as they did in. All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic  social disruption and respecting human rights.  WHO’s mandate is public health. But we’re working with many partners across all sectors to mitigate the social and economic consequences of this Covid- pandemic. This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector – so every sector and every inidual must be involved in the fight. I have said from the beginning that countries must take a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach, built around a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact. Let me summarize it in four key areas. One: Prepare and be ready. Two: Detect, protect and treat. Three: Reduce transmission. Four: Innovate and learn.

Doctors have been able to identy specic abnormalities caused by Covid- and the patterns are similar to those found in patients from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. The scans show patches in the lungs and the expertsapos findings could lead to a quicker diagnosis and help to prevent infections. The first British person to catch the flu-like illness had previously told how it hit him like a train and left him suffocating and in blinding pain for weeks. Have you been diagnosed with coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story. CT scans of a -year-old woman who tested positive after visiting Wuhan, China - the initial epicentre of the global outbreak - show white patches in her lungs. The abnormalities are known as ground glass opacity, or fluid in the spaces in the lungs, and they were more pronounced in later scans. The woman was admitted to hospital after having a fever for a week, a cough, fatigue and chest congestion. She was diagnosed with severe Covid- pneumonia and treated with oxygen and antibiotics.  In another case, a -year-old man, who worked at the Wuhan seafood market where the virus was though to have been passed to humans, went to a hospital after suffering a high fever and cough for almost two weeks on December  last year. A chest CT scan showed similar patches and scans taken later showed how the opacities had spread. The man was diagnosed with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, but he died a week later. A -year-old woman from Sichuan Province in China was diagnosed after ing from Japan and developing a fever, cough and chest pain.  There were extensive white patches in her chest scan and a reversed halo sign was observed in the left upper lobe, the medical journal Radiology reported. A recent study of more than , patients, published in Radiology, found that chest CT scans were better than lab testing at diagnosing coronavirus at an early stage. The researchers concluded that CT scans should be the primary screening method.  In the US, doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City were the first in America to analyse CT scans of Covid- sufferers. The doctors said they identied specic patterns in the lungs of dozens of patients who were hospitalised in China at the height of the epidemic there. The ground glass opacities, or patches, became more dense over time, and the patterns were similar to those found in patients who contracted SARS or MERS.The doctors found fully involved lung disease in  patients who had scans between six and  days after they reported symptoms. In the UK, six people have died after testing positive for coronavirus. All were aged over  and had underlying health conditions. At least  people have been diagnosed with the virus in Britain. The first Briton to die was a man who caught the bug on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/PSmi_-Eilish_McColgan_speaking_to_young_Dundee_Hawkhill_Harrier_athletes_191119_07.jpg ","title":"colourful mural honouring eilish mccolgan planned for dundee","story":"A #passionate# and vibrant mural honouring Dundee runner Eilish McColgan has been proposed for a city centre gable end.A marketing firm has submitted plans for the  metretall painting to Dundee City Council on behalf of Scottish Athletics.It depicts the Hawkhill Harrier at full pelt in a past event, and is designed to celebrate her and her team#s success in the run-up to the  Tokyo Olympics.The runner said: #I#m really excited to be part of the Scottish Athletics murals project.#It feels special to be part of such a strong crop of Scottish athletes and hopefully it will inspire a new generation of youngsters coming through.#It makes it even more special to have it in Dundee where my running club Dundee Hawks is and where I went to school and university too.#I#m honoured to be part of it all and I know my family are proud too.#The -year-old, who notched up a silver medal in the m at the European Championships in , is aiming to compete in the m and ,m events in Japan.She also picked up a bronze in the m at the European Indoor Championships in .Planning documents detail how the mural is proposed for Palais Court, to the west of West Marketgait and to the south of the South Tay Street car park.The building is owned by the Home Group, which has given permission for the artwork to be put up on the gable end.Funding has been provided for the mural by legal firm Lindsays to put up and maintain the mural until the Olympics concludes on August .If the runner is successful in Tokyo, there is an option to extend the mural#s le beyond the end of the Summer Games.The mural is the second in Tayside to be proposed, following an already-approved bid to display a mural of Perthshire hurdler and relay-runner Eilidh Doyle in the Fair City.Mark Munro, chief executive of Scottish Athletics, previously said: #Our aim is to encourage children and adults around Scotland to support the athletes and realise that athletics and exercise is open to all.#We think street images of top athletes can really help build on a growing profile for athletics in Scotland.#Dundee city planners have until May  to consider the proposal."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/19893463-859x564.jpg ","title":"dundee 2 0 ayr hemmings and crankshaw goals see dark blues leapfrog honest men","story":"A FIFTH clean sheet on the bounce saw Dundee move into third spot after a deserved - victory over Ayr United at Dens Park.The Dark Blues stretched their unbeaten run to six matches as they saw off the Honest Men thanks to Kane Hemmings# th-minute opener and Olly Crankshaw#s first for the club.There were two changes to the Dundee starting XI as Christie Elliott replaced Cammy Kerr at right wing-back while Andrew Nelson came in for Jordan McGhee, who hadn#t recovered from a dead leg picked up against the Honest Men on Saturday.Goalkeeper Jack Hamilton was missing from the squad after his we gave birth on Monday night.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC. Kick-off is pm with Kintyre Park the expected venue.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

There is a general consensus that,Scotland were to vote for independence, then the country would immediately apply to rejoin the European Union as a fully-fledged member state.One current report suggests that this entire process could take as little as five years, meaning that Scotland could very well be a paid-up member of the EU, once again, by the middle of the decade. While there are plenty of benefits in the EU for a country with a GDP and population roughly the same as Finland joining the club, there would also be some trade-offs.It is more than likely that Scotland would be unable to retain a currency opt-out, meaning that it would have to switch its currency from the British Pound Sterlingto the Euro . It would also mean that Scotlands sizeable financial sector would have to sign up to EU passporting regulations, governing trades, and transactions.All of this would likely have a signicant impact on private financial traders across Scotland. With all this in mind, here is what we might expect is Scotland rejoined the EU.CurrencyThe most noticeable change for private citizens and traders, in the event of Scotland joining the EU, would be the currency. The Scottish pounds in your pocket would no longer be considered legal tender once the Eurozone rules kick in and the Euro becomes the official currency of Scotland. This would hence affect all forms of trade within a newly independent Scotland.In terms of import and export markets, the cost of buying and selling would be determined largely by the value of the Euro, which is currently lower than the value of the Pound. This would also have a sizeable impact on Scotlands foreign exchangetrading markets.Those who would like to learn more about what forex trading is,should keep in mind that it is one of the largest financial activities in the world, in which the conversion of one currency to another accounts for more than  trillion worth of trades per day. Scotlands entry into the EU would likely have a signicant impact on, say, the pairing of the GBP and EUR, that traders would need to be aware of when operating across the global financial markets.Source: UnsplashFinancial Regulations  Monetary PolicyAnother impact of Scotland joining the EU that would quickly become noticeable would be the new financial regulations that would be put in place. At the moment, the UK currently follows most of the financial regulations laid out in the EU trade policy, although there is less regulation in certain areas of the UKs market than in most EU countries.This would likely change in Scotland upon rejoining. In order for the large financial companies in Edinburgh to enjoy access to EU markets, they would have to sign up to EU rules regarding passporting, which is the process by which member states can complete financial trades and transactions freely across the Bloc.Another impact for traders would be in the realm of monetary policy. Key decisions such as interest rate rises and quantitative easing would be signed off at the European Central Bank headquarters in Frankfurt. While Scotland would have a say over monetary decisions that affect it, so would the  other EU member states.These are the main ways that Scotlands re-accession to the EU would affect financial trading. While it is impossible to predict exactly how things would change, the previous experience of new EU member states suggests that this is broadly accurate."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  the heated question of     heat","story":"Here in the heart of the Borders, I look back on that flat with nostalgia.

I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil.

The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it. I was well on my way when Lazarus rose from the duvet to check on the proceedings and pointed out that I was laying them sideways rather than end-on. As the sun disappeared and clouds gathered I started again. By this time a neighbour had spotted me, and helped me finish the job.The sense of satisfaction in having it all safely stored, shortly before snowfall, was incalculable. Thatrsquos the thing about wood. The connection between you and the trees yoursquore burning creates a new respect and understanding. For a start, freshly chopped logs give off a delicious scent. And each one is dferent ndash whorled, fissured, misshapen, or neatly wedged like a giant slice of cake.

I think this is a matter for standards.ldquoIt should be put in the code of conduct for MSPs that we should not have unsupervised contact with vulnerable people.Alex Neilwarned that forcing politicians to undergo backgroundchecks before they stand for office could lead to ldquoa real danger that it becomes a political football for people to kick.He added: ldquoThat would do no service to children or other vulnerable people.ldquoItrsquos fair for us to ask the standards committee to review the code of conduct for MSPs and establish whether therersquos any need to add to the code of conduct.Speaking after his amnedment was rejected, Mr Cole-Hamilton, said: \"It is not good enough for MSPs to rely on self-policing or say that they have voluntarily adopted the good practice of not spending time unaccompanied with children or vulnerable adults.\"We need to legislate for people as we occasionally find them not as we would wish them to be. History and inquiries have proven that approach puts people at risk so I canrsquot help but feel that in rejecting my amendments this parliament is making that same mistake again.\"He added: \"Elected office brings with it status, influence and access to vulnerable groups. We canrsquot just assume that because someone wins an election their conduct will be guaranteed or their intentions beyond reproach.ldquoPeople will be stunned that in the wake of high profile incidents of grooming and exploitation, the response of the other parties has been to conclude that this legislation should apply to everyone bar elected representatives.ldquoTo claim it is too complicated or that this shouldnrsquot be done through this once-in-a-decade child protection legislation is short-sighted and will be rightly questioned by the million people who we already insist must have a PVG.

Therefore, the decision to go with one team was made.“As I’m sure we can all understand, Shetland, who have supported us throughout, were unhappy with this decision and asked Orkney to reconsider and look at other ways to try to field a second team.“For Orkney, the cost of travel and the amount the association would have to subsidise players’ travel made sending two teams unfeasible.“Shetland voiced their concern over the cost of organising the event for only one team, and, after further discussions, the decision was finally taken that this year’s senior inter-county would not take place.“This decision has not been taken lightly, and the committee and players involved are very disappointed.“We hope the fixtures willnext year.”Shetland are in the midst of an unrelenting winning run at senior inter-county level Orkney having last won the ‘A’ fixture in .Leask said: “We tried to re-arrange it. Both counties have tried to do as much as we can.”The  inter-county will be the th anniversary of the fixtures, and both counties will be eager to ensure the occasion is celebrated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The slow progress on establishing basic connectivity for businesses and iniduals in the Northern Isles has been deeply frustrating. Concrete action to remedy this problem can only be a good thing.“This, however, is only the first step. I have been led to understand that the first upgrades to the network are to begin in the autumn, and we will be looking for swt action.”He continued: “With a plan in place and an agreement signed there can be no more excuses.

According to this report, in fact, Huawei is one of the companies that has benefitted.”Responding during the debate, Iain Duncan Smith MP said: “I think that’s shocking. I thinkthat is true it is an absolutely indictment and I do think the British Government has got to be speaking up more. It is shocking and it is time that we call it for what it is.”Summing up at the end of the debate, the minister for digital infrastructure, Matt Warman MP, said: #The UK has been vocal in drawing attention to the systematic violation of human rights of Uighur Muslims. We set out our expectations in the UK National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights.”Speaking after the debate, Mr Carmichael added: “The reports surrounding Huawei and the use of forced labour are concerning.

Youth team Strom-West also offers a pathway for young girls to develop to senior football.Kirsty Brown, who plays for Kirkwall City, explained: “Women’s football in Orkney, over the last couple of years, has taken a massive step.“We’ve seen the development of Kirkwall City, in addition to Orkney Women’s Football Club, and the logical step now is try and come together, get as strong as we possibly can, and to get inter-county and Island Games going.“ is a massive step ahead of us. It’s not that long away, so we definitely need to work together and see what we can do.“There’s fantastic players in both sides. It’s great that we’ve got two clubs. It’s completely needed for the number of players in Orkney. Both teams are in the Highlands and Islands League this year, playing  matches each.“That’s a massive opportunity for the girls and women in Orkney to play competitively, but the association will bring these two teams together and form an even stronger squad who can play on an inter-county level.“The meeting itself is an initial AGM. We would really like to be in a position where we could form a committee, officially start the association, and move forward in the best way possible for the future of football.”Developing Orkney as a county squad and an Island Games regular will take time, effort and commitment.Like many sports, women’s football is now putting the building blocks in place for a successful Games in , but early discussions are taking place in regards to sending a side to the  Games in Guernsey.Nicola Croy, who plays her football for Orkney Women’s, said: “The  Games will be an eye-opener. There’s a lot of great teams out there, so it will show Orkney how much we need to come together as an Island Games team and prepare ourselves for our home  Games.“Once this committee is set up, we can start with developing the county and Island Games team.”Among the positions to fill will be coach of the new county side, tasked with guiding the development of the team and leading the team to success.And in a bid to expand the playing pool even further, women who may not be playing league football currently are still encouraged to attend the meeting in April.Brown added: “There is a magnitude of abilities out there in Orkney and they’re maybe not playing.“Anybody that wants to get involved in any way, come along on April . It’s a fantastic opportunity for girls and Orkney in general.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This data will then be used in further assessing the viability of the sites.The masts are due to be installed at Quanterness and Hoy by the end of March — with a dferent kind of measurement system being used at the site in Faray.Planning permission for the masts was approved in December last year.Meteorological masts are an assembly of bolted, galvanised steel tube sections, consisting of a series of anemometers, wind vanes and a data logger, solar , temperature sensor and antenna. The equipment gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.The masts will be up to  metres in height and will be in place for up to two years.If the Community Wind Farm Project#s proposals and sites are found through the planning process to be appropriate and the project goes forward, OIC believes it could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney. The council has stated that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling OIC to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon and providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council also hopes that developments will also allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a needs case for a new interconnector for Orkney, with the aim of substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Due to practical limitations, the Faray site has already had a Lidar system installed to measure wind speed and direction.  Lidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is very similar to radar.The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six turbines and the site on Faray has enough space for up to seven turbines. The current proposal at the site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines at a blade tip height of up to .m.Pre-application consultation for the proposed site at Quanterness took place in November last year and a planning application was lodged with the planning authority in January. OIC has since written to the Scottish Government to ask that they call in the application, on grounds of national signicance.Further public consultation events are planned for Hoy in March, with Faray events in Eday and Westray likely to take place in May.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John.

West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material. The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages.

I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March .

It is no longer day-by-day. Parents, teachers and students need to know that there is a solid plan in place. I would also like a helpline for schools beyond what is on the Public Health Authority.Two weeks ago, Italy had the same number of cases as the UK does now. We must use this time to get in front of this situation because we do not want to be in the same position as Italy in two weeks# time.In Co Armagh two schools on the same site, Newtownhamilton primary and high school, were shut after a student tested positive for the virus.The NASUWT, the largest teaching union here with around , members, and the Ulster Teachers Union are understood to be waiting on guidance from the Education Authority. The NASUWT#s website has added a page updating members who are infected and advice on school trips.It says: As cases occur, more people will be required to self-isolate. It is vital that staff follow the advice of the Government to prevent the spread.Where teachers are absent from work due to self-isolation, this should be considered a medical suspension rather than sick leave and full pay should apply. Absence should also be disregarded for absence management procedures.Schools should ensure that risk assessments for visits abroad are reviewed, taking into account not only the risk of infection, but also the risk of becoming stranded, should the situation deteriorate rapidly. Schools should liaise closely with tour operators in their decision-making process of whether to cancel any visits.SDLP education spokesman and West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan also asked for an action plan for schools.However, the Ulster Unionists# spokesman for health said there was no need for alarm.Robbie Butler MLA added: If the scientic advice changes, then we must react accordingly, but we must listen to what the medical and scientic experts are saying and take their advice.Belfast Related ContentGalleryCoronavirusCoronavirus: Economist warns of £k blow to Belfast over St Patrick#s shutdownCancelling Belfast#s St Patrick#s Day parade could cost the city#s economy around £, and affect staff numbers, an economist has said. ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Sunak also abolished tax relief on red diesel for most sectors. The changes will not take effect for two years and the relief will be retained for agriculture, rail, domestic heating and fishing.An increase in the National Insurance threshold from £, to £, will be worth £ a year to  million people, the Chancellor said.VAT on books, newspapers, magazines and academic journals will be scrapped from December , while a £ billion building safety fund will be set up to ensure all unsafe combustible cladding is removed from buildings above fttall in the wake of the Grenfell fire disaster.

Auditors from energy watchdog Ofgem have deemed this irregular spending, which is expected to hit a total of £m by the year  .In , there was a massive spike in applications to the scheme which the RHI inquiry was told was partly due to information being shared with the renewable energy industry.The then Department for Enterprise discussed possible tarf cuts to the scheme with firms in the biomass sector in the summer of that year.One civil servant told the inquiry  he thought there should have been less promotion of the scheme as officials already knew the cost for that year was twice the available budget. Ex-DUP MLA Jonathan Bell, then the minister responsible for RHI, told the inquiry that officials had not informed him of the spike in applications.It was told that one adviser said we could fill our boots as the scheme was being paid for from the Westminster budget, rather than Stormont#s.The forecast cost of the RHI scheme in   is £-m, thanks to cost controls which were put in place in . Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadLyra McKee#s heartbroken mum Joan dies ahead of first anniversary of daughter#s murder Derry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widowJudge dismisses #waste of time# injury claims backed by now struck-off Northern Ireland GPBelfast owners in big Cheltenham win as Ravenhill romps in at  Sex abuser made boy #do things#he got footballer names wrong, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We had to do a petition first to make sure that everybody wanted it on their street, estate or road.”“We have the names for all the sites – the only one we didn’t get was the Foreglen Road because of theof it! We just did around Foreglen and Muldonagh.”Mr McCloskey said the people in the village have shown an interest in Irish and are keen to see it developed in Foreglen.He said: “People have been coming to me saying they would like to see Irish classes.“It’s something that they’re into and people have been speaking to me from all walks of le. It’s about having that option.“I think it’s a good thing and hopefully,we can get classes up and running, it’s something that could really take off.”Local MLA Kathleen McGurk has been supportive of the plan and is confident it will improve the area.She said: “Quite a few areas of Foreglen didn’t even have signage.“This will harmonise the whole area, get some nice new signs in and the residents were keen to get them in Irish as well.“It’s a small, close-knit community with a lot of Irish roots and the people would be keen. The council have been undertaking village planning of the smaller settlements within the area.“They asked communities to put together wishlists that they would like to see and that was one of them – the Irish signs.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Councillor for the area, Brenda Chivers, said that although the provision of a waste water plant was still an issue for the school development, she didn’t see it as ‘problematic’. She said: “I sincerely hope that work on the new school will commence as soon as possible. “I would praise all the good work of pupils, staff, parents and the Board of Governors for all their diligent work to date.”Local GAA side Limavady Wolfhounds have also been given the go-ahead to develop their existing provision on the Scroggy Road.The work will include a new grass pitch, G training area, ball catchers and a walking path around the complex. Committee member Declan Quigley and his company AQB Architectural Workshop were a driving force in the development.He said: “This involves the redevelopment of an empty field known to the club as the ‘hill field’. It lies to the rear of our existing main pitch.“We were facing the possibility of losing our existing training grounds at some point when the lease runs out and the parish kindly agreed to sell us the area required to build a second pitch.“Once that was put in place, a planning application was lodged for a second full-size grass pitch with floodlighting, fences, dugouts and ball catches.“We had enough ground to provide an underage G training pitch. It’s a half-size pitch which is also floodlit.“Looking towards giving back to the community and giving parents something to do while their kids are down at training, we developed the idea of a km walking loop.“It meanders around the existing pitch and will go around the proposed new phase development. It will have lighting on it so anyone can come and do walk when it suits them.“That was approved through council last week and the club would like to thank Causeway Coast and Glens council for the approval. “It leaves us in a position where we can develop that bit of ground and protect the club’s future, while maintaining a valuable youth link, which is very important in an urban setting.“We have five years to develop it from a planning point of view, but would like to get that process started immediately, or as soon as financially possible.”Cllr Chivers said the development would further improve the developments the club has made to date.She said: “This will signicantly enhance the excellent facilities that this far-seeing and dynamic club have provided to date.“I congratulate all the management, members, players and supporters on all their efforts.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Following the decision, the applicant Clanmil Housing Association, said it was ‘very disappointed’ and would consider the full range of options moving forward. The application was for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of  two-bedroom apartments with rooftop amenity space, new access arrangements from Victoria Road, servicing and drop off provision, bin stores, cycle parking, landscaping and associated site works. The Council’s planning department recommended that committee members approve the application with an officer saying it was entirely compliant. googletag.cmd.push It was described as possibly the most dficult regeneration site in the city, which was originally given planning approval in . It sits m below the level of the Victoria Road and is boxed in by the River Foyle and perimeter walls with limited accessibility. The application received a total of  representations,  objections and one letter of support. Of the total,  related to the amended design which incorporates a glass tower separating the two blocks. In the report it is noted that the primary objections to this development are no parking provision for residents and the adverse impact of congestion on Victoria Road caused by vehicles turning in and out of the site. googletag.cmd.push Developers proposed that there would be no parking on site, aside from operational parking, such as bin lorries and emergency services. CCTV monitoring and barrier operation would be automated for -hour operation. Planning officers said it will reinvigorate riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. The natural brick was chosen to better complement the stone finish of the historic Ice House - which sits adjacent - and provide a contemporary building as recognition of the industrial heritage of the wider area. Around two stories of the building would be visible from the Victoria Road and you would see the building from lands opposite on the Foyle Road. ‘Eyesore’ Speaking at the meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group raised a number of objections. He described the design as a horric brutalist East German style eyesore . He said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. Mr Hegarty believed Clanmil Developments would later apply for parking spaces. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in hazardous parking on Victoria Road. He envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. The local resident questioned how it would work allowing only one vehicle on to the site at a timeother vehicles were waiting. Mistakes have been made in the past with the BT building and others near Derry’s riverfront and he hoped the planning committee wouldn’t be remembered for this carbuncle. In response, an agent representing Clanmil said the development would go some way to reducing the housing demand in Derry with around , people on the waiting list. He refuted the suggestion of a future application for car parking saying that was absolutely not the case as there will be a zero parking solution on site and people would manage deliveries. Housing applicants would be made aware that there is no car ownership in this scheme. It is a highly accessible location with bus stops and train travel nearby, he added. The agent also contended that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. Congestion  Above: Artists impression of the building from Foyle Road. Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney who is a lorry driver said it would only take one heavy goods vehicleto block the Victoria Road and there would be massive tailbacks. “At the best of times it’s absolutely horrendous, it would only take one timed delivery to go wrong and traffic would be down past the Everglades Hotel.” He was assured there would be no disruption to traffic on the Victoria Road and told there’s enough room for one vehiclethe barrier was down. SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins said she normally had brilliant things to say about Clanmil but on this occasion believed that the no parking clause discriminates against disabled applicants. “Disability Action will have a lot of issues with this development.” She added: “You’re saying, people can have an apartment with lovely views overlooking the Foyle as long as they’re not disabled or have complex needs.” In terms of parking on Duke Street and Spencer Road, she said it has a one hour parking restriction and askedresidents would be expected to park after pm. The Ballyarnett Cllr suggested Clanmil needed to be educated. While acknowledging a “housing deficit”, she said, people need quality housing, a quality le, quality access and disabled people should have the same rights as everyone . A Clanmil representative said a range of accommodation is needed and people with complex needs are allocated houses by the Housing Executive. Refused Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Patricia Logue, said no distinction should be made between applicants and homes are allocated on a points-based system. “Those with the highest points are given first offer and refusal.” Disabled tenants may have carers who have to visit them three times a day. She warned that Clanmil could be taken to the Equality Commission over the scheme as some people need a car and can’t be treated dferently to those who don’t. Chair of the committee, Christopher Jackson, echoed her views saying those waiting years on homes shouldn’t have to choose between a home or their car. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced the need for housing but believes it has to be done right. He said: “Representatives are trying to create a more accessible city and district for those with disabilities.” He wasn’t convinced about the aesthetics of the building and insisted that the beautul riverfront must be regenerated appropriately. “It looks to me like a car parking facility, I don’t mean to insult the designer.” Picking up on Cllr Logue’s point about carers, DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said people want letime homes but don’t know when their circumstances might change. Cllr Dobbins proposed that members do not accept the planning officers’ recommendation and refuse the application on grounds that it is contrary to access and movement and because of the design. “It does not allow people with disabilities to be included in a social housing scheme,” she concluded. Seven councillors voted in favour of her proposal, none against and there were four abstentions. The application was therefore refused. Afterwards a Clanmil spokesperson said: “Whilst we acknowledge the thinking of committee members, this city centre scheme could help address urgent housing need in the Waterside area. “This decision is therefore particularly bad news for families who desperately need a home. “We are considering the full range of options available to us and will decide on a way forward shortly.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Getting a renowned author to the school, and to get one such as Kelly is amazing.“Creativity is so important to students, and hopefully she will help inspire future young writers.”Describing how the students loved the many dferent formats the event took, the librarian continued: “The circus theme of the talk went down a storm. Students loved the real or fake freak show characters, with lots of gasps and laughs.“The hall fell wonderfully silent as Kelly read aloud from her book, leaving the pupils wanting more.“And, more important, she was happy to answer all the students questions and received a rapturous applause at the end.”Kelly McCaughrain was last year’s recipient of Children’s Books Ireland Book of the Year, the Eilis Dillon and Children’s Choice Awards  winner for her ‘Flying Tips for Flightless Birds’ novel.The author said she enjoyed her first journey to the north west.“I’m grateful to Mairead for asking me along here today and hope the students got as much fun and learning out of it as I did. “This is one of eight visits to schools across Northern Ireland over this week and it was lovely to visit Oakgrove Integrated College. Indeed, I hope to be asked back again in the not too distant future.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Amongst them, one person beamed you should write I couldn’t see anyone there!’, laughing like he had pulled a joke out of the Billy Connolly catalogue. So firstly, I want to assure you I won’t be taking that route. So,you are looking for a pun or two, you won’t be able to see any he... - dammit, let’s move on.The Invisible Man is a continuation of Hollywood’s new found love for reboots, with the classic novel by HG Wells first brought to the big screen back in , and this time we have Australian director Leigh Whannell taking the reins to give it a more modern touch.Whanell, who is attached to previous horror thriller block- busters such as Saw and Insidious as a writer, is well experienced in the genre, and from minute one, you know the film is in very good hands.The film tells the story of Cecilia, played by Elisabeth Moss.We are thrown straight into her unhappy world in an opening sequence that absolutely sets the tone for what is to come in terms of sheer tension.Cecilia has drugged her boyfriend Adrianinto a deep sleep in the early hours of the morning, and immediately sets about the process of getting the hell out of there.Which wouldnt be too dficult in a normal house, but a normal house it is not.She has to tread a gadget world obstacle course featuring security alarms, passwords and cameras in what I can only describe is a setting you would see in a Mission Impossible meets  type of film.Because it turns out, her boyfriend is a genius millionaire scientist control freak who has taken every precaution in an attempt to keep her in his clutches.After narrowly making her escape thanks to her sister Emily, Cecilia finally has some sort of freedom, but matters soon take a very strange turn. Shortly afterwards she is delivered the news that Adrian has killed himself by his lawyer brother, and that he has also left  million of his vast fortune to her. So hey, it’s not all bad.Except it is it’s very bad.Just when Cecilia believes her le is becoming a little bit rosier, events begin to spiral out of control in quite sinister ways. The oven suddenly goes on fire, her blanket is tossed around her bedroom, and she too ends up drugged. Adrian still very much has a pulse, and through his scientic and technical wizardy, he’s only gone and made himself invisible in a bid to make his ex’s le a living hell, with very tricks more brutal than the last. A new tinder account and going back on the market would have been less hassle, but, what do I know Now on paper, it all sounds a bit over the top, and in the hands of a lesser film maker I may have headed for the exit early.But this film delivers, for two reasons.Firstly, Whanell’s direction is flawless. He burrows into the quite effective horror trope of less is more, not resorting at all to endless jump scares that we see too often nowadays.His camera work excels in making the viewer completely uneasy throughout. There is one sequence where the camera is simply moving slowly from left to right while Cecila wanders the house alone during the night. Whanell plays with the audience superbly. He knows he has us in the palm of his hand. Where is Adrian  What will he do next Now in a role that requires the lead to portray terror, paranoia, rejection and abuse, Elisabeth Moss is outstanding.This is a film with very strong themes in some quarters it has been called the first big film of the #metoo movement in its representation of domestic abuse, and there is certainly symbols of that at dferent stages, with Moss carrying the flame in fine fashion as she attempts to defeat her own predator.She is utterly convincing in her despair as her world begins to fall apart from all angles, including one horrying turn of events that will have your jaw almost touching the floor - you have been warned. She shows all her acting props that were also on display in the hugely popular Handmaids Tale series.So,you’re a weirdo like myself and enjoy being disturbed and uncomfortable for two hours or so, then ‘The Invisible Man’ will be money well spent.Hey, we might even get a sequel, although, given the films climax, ‘I canny see that’ happening.I’ll stop now.The Invisible Man is now showing at Brunswick Moviebowl. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As I said there’s no easy matches in the league and the sooner we realise that, the better.”McChrystal made his first start of the season at the RSC and was arguably the only City player to leave the pitch with his head high, but that is of no consolation to the -year old, who believes the visitors did not appear for the second half.“I don’t think we performed the way we can and obviously the manner of the two goals, one right before half-time and the other right before the final whistle, isn’t what we wanted,” he added.“It’s always going to be tough and you have to roll your sleeves up and do all the dirty parts of the game and then hopefully you can open things up in the final third as the game progressives and then maybe create something and get a goal, which we did, but their goal right before half-time, killed us.“In saying that it was only - and we were still in the game we had to come out in the second half try to go again and look to create the chances, but as I don’t think we did that tonight and probably got what we deserved in the end.” googletag.cmd.push Far from convincingAs an attacking threat, City have been far from convincing this season so far, with just four goals in four games. They laboured in attacking areas of the pitch on Friday and McChrystal admitted that it is a concern.“The way the game was going, they had the momentum and as a group we have to sit in there and just say ‘listen you know what, we’ll take a - and get back up the road with a point’, because in the second half I don’t think we looked like scoring,” he explained.“It’s concerning that we didn’t look like scoring, but it’s up to us to change that. As a group now we have got to get our work done in the training ground and go again next week, that’s the only way you can go about this.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At , the long-time proprietor of a Pennyburn sports shop is a le-affirming example to others of how to live a meaningful le after sporting retirement, thanks to the enduring power of friendship.  He pulls up the metal shutters of the shop and fights with the key as it struggles to unlock the door.It’s a short trip from home to his premises in Pennyburn but it’s a well-trodden path for a man now in his s.With a local paper snuggly secured under his armpit he’s made this journey in rain, hail and shine. Through good times and bad.It’s the same old routine every morning, one well-rehearsed over  years of business. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Jobby’s Sports Centre opened in the late s after he bought it from his friend Raymond Daly. I was entering a business I knew something about,’ Jobby says now. Picture: Tom Heaney  But this is no ordinary shop, and this is no ordinary shopkeeper.John Hume can probably hold claim to be Derry’s most famous living citizen. But without any shadow of a doubt, the Maiden City’s most famous sporting son is John ‘Jobby’ Crossan.Crossan needs no introduction in these parts, but for the benefit of the uninitiated ‘Jobby’ Crossan was born in  at Hamilton Street in Derry.A precocious talent Crossan played as an inside forwardfor his hometown team, Derry City. His performances quickly garnered the attention of the top scouts from England, where thespoke of the -year-old wonder boy of Irish soccer … Irelands Jimmy Greaves. In August  he joined Sparta Rotterdam, before making his debut for Ireland against England at Wembley. But more of that game later.Crossan joined Standard Liegravege in , playing for the Belgian side in a European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid.Ian Rush may have famously described playing in Italy like being in a foreign country, but the Derry man negotiated this precarious new le abroad with all the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Fully focused: team captain Crossan leads out Manchester City, a club he joined after a successful spell at Sunderland. He moved on to Middlebrough in .  “It was great,” he enthused. “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I might have been lucky as a player but obviously I could play a wee bit. We learned a couple of languages and things. We were fortunate because we were winning matches, playing for trophies. Played against the top teams. We played Real Madrid in the semi-final of the  European Cup. We beat Rangers in the quarter-finals and I happened to get two goals.”In September  he moved to Sunderland, the start of a successful eight-year spell in England that also took him to Manchester Cityand Middlesbrough.In a European Championship qualier against Poland he scored one of the finest goals that Windsor Park has ever witnessed, a spectacular and acrobatic volley from  yards. And in a World Cup preliminary game Crossan scored three against Albania.He retired from the professional game in .But this isn’t a feature about a footballer, a special talent, a shopkeeper. That tale has been told before.This is a story about something more important than that.This is a story of friendship.Upon retirement Crossan faced the same dilemma as most professional sportsmen – how to fill the void.“Your whole world changes and you have to find something to fill that hole,” he explains. “I decided to come back home to Derry.”  PICTURED:Jobby Crossan in his Sunderland days. He was a prolic striker, scoring  goals in his  appearnces for the club between  and . That particular hole in his le was filled by a sports shop in Pennyburn he bought in the late s.“I bought the shop from a friend of mine, Raymond Daly. I thought I knew a bit about sport and this might do. I was entering a business I knew something about.” Jobby’s Sports Centre was born.You think of Barcelona’s great club motto – Meacutes que unclub . Well Jobby’s became more than a shop.Almost from its inception the place became a magnet for friends – old and new – to congregate to chat about football, to hotly debate, to blether, but above all  to laugh.This has been the case for over four decades now, and, like the proprietor himself, shows little sign of slowing down. Not dissimilar to the barber shop scenes in Coming To America, the cast in Jobby’s Sports Centre ies from day to day. But it never empties.Joe Quigg, Roger ODoherty, Donal Ferry, Bobby Ross were all in attendance on this particular wet and windy Monday morning.Charlie Johnstone calls, as does Wee Black Joe Doherty, Harry Nelis and Noel Crampsie.Joe Doherty comes down from Strabane to chew the fat on all matters cricket related.On Thursdays Jimmy Blair, an old friend from Jobby’s playing days, Harry O’Kane and Alfie Taylor make the trek up from Coleraine without fail.Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs to go round and the host perches himself on a low hanging shelf, when he’s not ferrying tea back and forth.  PICTURED: Old friends: Jobby Crossan catches up with another well-known local football figure Gerry Doherty. They huddle around a gas heater that owes them nothing, swapping stories, slagging, telling tall tales – all cloaked with that quintessentially Derry sense of humour, based on familiarity and gentle ribbing.“These boys would come into the shop and I thought they’d keep me on the straight and narrow. Turns out they just kept me on the narrow, and drank all my tea,” explains the host. “I go through three kettles a year!”Stories abound of local players, local teams, past and present. Their love of the game still undimmed, and the warmth among this band of brothers is evident.Football connects people. And sometimes those connections last a letime.Jobby, of course, has encountered more than most.“I’ve met three kings. The Swedish, Belgian and Norwegian Kings,” insists Crossan, very matter-of-factly.In , before his debut for Northern Ireland against England, he met Field Marshall Montgomery at Wembley.Crossan re-tells the occasion with a photographic recall.“You’re from my neck of the woods old spud ” says Crossan in a posh English accent to the mirth of his companions.“Nearby” replied Jobby. “You’re from Moville and I’m from Derry.”“Very good,” came back Montgomery, “Have a good game!”, again to enthusiastic laughter.“But that’s how it is in football. You run round making friends, and there was I from the Brandywell in Derry rubbing shoulders with a World War  general.”Jobby, of course, became great friends with George Best and the Derry man has nothing but fond memories of his old Manchester housemate and international team-mate.“Not for publication!” he says with a glint in his eye when asked did he have any stories he’d like to share.“George was one of the greats. There were good players about like Pele and Di Stefano, but George played in a league where they would kicks lumps out you. Players went out to nail him. But George was unique, a class of his own. He was more or less reared in my house in Manchester. We never got peace. One Friday afternoon we had two Miss Worlds in.”“George had them both!” jumps in Donal Ferry, again to roars of laughter.  PICTURED: Jobby pictured with manager Joe Mercer and his Manchester City teammates The bond between friends get much stronger with age, according to a recent study from the University of Michigan. Friendships play a key role in health and happiness – especially as we get older.The study wasn’t written about Jobby Crossan and his friends in the shop, but it might as well have been.Former East Stirling and Derry City player Bobby Ross would be the longest serving attendee at Jobby’s.Indeed, the two veterans had been playing in a weekly five-aside game at the Templemore Complex up until last year when a locked cartilage finally brought an end to the great man’s career at the age of .“Cut short in my prime!” Jobby quips, only half joking and ever the competitor.“I’ve been coming in here from the start,” says his friend Bobby in a soft Scottish accent that hasn’t left him despite living in these shores as long as the shop has been open.“Sure, I’ve nothing  to bloody well do!”“No, the craic’s good,” he continues, “the craic’s always very good in here. It soon passes an hour or two and you can get tea and coffee any time. And you might get an odd bun!”In a final poignant moment he confesses: “No, I’d be lost without it to tell you the truth.”Bobby Ross seems to speak for them all when he says these words.At the close of business, the gas heater is switched off, the lights dimmed and the shutter comes down once more.The front door key still refuses to play ball, especially in these dark nights, before it finally turns in the lock.But this is far from daily drudgery, it’s a labour of love.In the sweetness of friendship let there be conversation and laughter, for in the dew of the morning that is where the heart is refreshed and stays forever young.Jobby’s Sports Centre – more than a shop.

He pulls up the metal shutters of the shop and fights with the key as it struggles to unlock the door.It’s a short trip from home to his premises in Pennyburn but it’s a well-trodden path for a man now in his s.With a local paper snuggly secured under his armpit he’s made this journey in rain, hail and shine. Through good times and bad.It’s the same old routine every morning, one well-rehearsed over  years of business. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Jobby’s Sports Centre opened in the late s after he bought it from his friend Raymond Daly. I was entering a business I knew something about,’ Jobby says now. Picture: Tom Heaney  But this is no ordinary shop, and this is no ordinary shopkeeper.John Hume can probably hold claim to be Derry’s most famous living citizen. But without any shadow of a doubt, the Maiden City’s most famous sporting son is John ‘Jobby’ Crossan.Crossan needs no introduction in these parts, but for the benefit of the uninitiated ‘Jobby’ Crossan was born in  at Hamilton Street in Derry.A precocious talent Crossan played as an inside forwardfor his hometown team, Derry City. His performances quickly garnered the attention of the top scouts from England, where thespoke of the -year-old wonder boy of Irish soccer … Irelands Jimmy Greaves. In August  he joined Sparta Rotterdam, before making his debut for Ireland against England at Wembley. But more of that game later.Crossan joined Standard Liegravege in , playing for the Belgian side in a European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid.Ian Rush may have famously described playing in Italy like being in a foreign country, but the Derry man negotiated this precarious new le abroad with all the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Fully focused: team captain Crossan leads out Manchester City, a club he joined after a successful spell at Sunderland. He moved on to Middlebrough in .  “It was great,” he enthused. “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I might have been lucky as a player but obviously I could play a wee bit. We learned a couple of languages and things. We were fortunate because we were winning matches, playing for trophies. Played against the top teams. We played Real Madrid in the semi-final of the  European Cup. We beat Rangers in the quarter-finals and I happened to get two goals.”In September  he moved to Sunderland, the start of a successful eight-year spell in England that also took him to Manchester Cityand Middlesbrough.In a European Championship qualier against Poland he scored one of the finest goals that Windsor Park has ever witnessed, a spectacular and acrobatic volley from  yards. And in a World Cup preliminary game Crossan scored three against Albania.He retired from the professional game in .But this isn’t a feature about a footballer, a special talent, a shopkeeper. That tale has been told before.This is a story about something more important than that.This is a story of friendship.Upon retirement Crossan faced the same dilemma as most professional sportsmen – how to fill the void.“Your whole world changes and you have to find something to fill that hole,” he explains. “I decided to come back home to Derry.”  PICTURED:Jobby Crossan in his Sunderland days. He was a prolic striker, scoring  goals in his  appearnces for the club between  and . That particular hole in his le was filled by a sports shop in Pennyburn he bought in the late s.“I bought the shop from a friend of mine, Raymond Daly. I thought I knew a bit about sport and this might do. I was entering a business I knew something about.” Jobby’s Sports Centre was born.You think of Barcelona’s great club motto – Meacutes que unclub . Well Jobby’s became more than a shop.Almost from its inception the place became a magnet for friends – old and new – to congregate to chat about football, to hotly debate, to blether, but above all  to laugh.This has been the case for over four decades now, and, like the proprietor himself, shows little sign of slowing down. Not dissimilar to the barber shop scenes in Coming To America, the cast in Jobby’s Sports Centre ies from day to day. But it never empties.Joe Quigg, Roger ODoherty, Donal Ferry, Bobby Ross were all in attendance on this particular wet and windy Monday morning.Charlie Johnstone calls, as does Wee Black Joe Doherty, Harry Nelis and Noel Crampsie.Joe Doherty comes down from Strabane to chew the fat on all matters cricket related.On Thursdays Jimmy Blair, an old friend from Jobby’s playing days, Harry O’Kane and Alfie Taylor make the trek up from Coleraine without fail.Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs to go round and the host perches himself on a low hanging shelf, when he’s not ferrying tea back and forth.  PICTURED: Old friends: Jobby Crossan catches up with another well-known local football figure Gerry Doherty. They huddle around a gas heater that owes them nothing, swapping stories, slagging, telling tall tales – all cloaked with that quintessentially Derry sense of humour, based on familiarity and gentle ribbing.“These boys would come into the shop and I thought they’d keep me on the straight and narrow. Turns out they just kept me on the narrow, and drank all my tea,” explains the host. “I go through three kettles a year!”Stories abound of local players, local teams, past and present. Their love of the game still undimmed, and the warmth among this band of brothers is evident.Football connects people. And sometimes those connections last a letime.Jobby, of course, has encountered more than most.“I’ve met three kings. The Swedish, Belgian and Norwegian Kings,” insists Crossan, very matter-of-factly.In , before his debut for Northern Ireland against England, he met Field Marshall Montgomery at Wembley.Crossan re-tells the occasion with a photographic recall.“You’re from my neck of the woods old spud ” says Crossan in a posh English accent to the mirth of his companions.“Nearby” replied Jobby. “You’re from Moville and I’m from Derry.”“Very good,” came back Montgomery, “Have a good game!”, again to enthusiastic laughter.“But that’s how it is in football. You run round making friends, and there was I from the Brandywell in Derry rubbing shoulders with a World War  general.”Jobby, of course, became great friends with George Best and the Derry man has nothing but fond memories of his old Manchester housemate and international team-mate.“Not for publication!” he says with a glint in his eye when asked did he have any stories he’d like to share.“George was one of the greats. There were good players about like Pele and Di Stefano, but George played in a league where they would kicks lumps out you. Players went out to nail him. But George was unique, a class of his own. He was more or less reared in my house in Manchester. We never got peace. One Friday afternoon we had two Miss Worlds in.”“George had them both!” jumps in Donal Ferry, again to roars of laughter.  PICTURED: Jobby pictured with manager Joe Mercer and his Manchester City teammates The bond between friends get much stronger with age, according to a recent study from the University of Michigan. Friendships play a key role in health and happiness – especially as we get older.The study wasn’t written about Jobby Crossan and his friends in the shop, but it might as well have been.Former East Stirling and Derry City player Bobby Ross would be the longest serving attendee at Jobby’s.Indeed, the two veterans had been playing in a weekly five-aside game at the Templemore Complex up until last year when a locked cartilage finally brought an end to the great man’s career at the age of .“Cut short in my prime!” Jobby quips, only half joking and ever the competitor.“I’ve been coming in here from the start,” says his friend Bobby in a soft Scottish accent that hasn’t left him despite living in these shores as long as the shop has been open.“Sure, I’ve nothing  to bloody well do!”“No, the craic’s good,” he continues, “the craic’s always very good in here. It soon passes an hour or two and you can get tea and coffee any time. And you might get an odd bun!”In a final poignant moment he confesses: “No, I’d be lost without it to tell you the truth.”Bobby Ross seems to speak for them all when he says these words.At the close of business, the gas heater is switched off, the lights dimmed and the shutter comes down once more.The front door key still refuses to play ball, especially in these dark nights, before it finally turns in the lock.But this is far from daily drudgery, it’s a labour of love.In the sweetness of friendship let there be conversation and laughter, for in the dew of the morning that is where the heart is refreshed and stays forever young.Jobby’s Sports Centre – more than a shop.

Clubs across Europe have this week taken the unprecedented action of playing games behind closed doors as the spread of the coronavirus continues across the world. Public gatherings across Europe and beyond have been banned in a bid to limit the spread of the virus, and this week discussions have been held at a national level to discuss the situation with regards public events in Ireland. The Football Association of Ireland met yesterday with the National League Executive Committee and the Professional Footballer’s Association of Ireland to discuss the impact of the Covid- outbreak on domestic football and established a steering group to monitor developments on a daily basis. An FAI spokesman said: “The meeting was a productive one and allowed us all to focus on the situation facing our National League clubs and players. We discussed atour serious concerns around Covid- and began to develop a contingency plan to help our clubs during this potentially dficult time.“We are currently gathering all financial data and working with the clubs and the players on the financial implications they face. Once we have a true understanding of this, we will be approaching Government and UEFA on behalf of the clubs to seek their support.”Devine however, is in no doubt what should happen in the coming weeks.“The one thing that we have in our league is time to play with,” he explained. “We shut down on the last week of October but maybe we dont have to do that this year. The one thing I am concerned about is the welfare of the clubs. Its fine whenever you have multi-million pound TV deals and sponsorship deals. We need the revenue of our support and every club in Ireland does. My worry is first and foremost the health of the players and the health of the supporters and secondly that we are sustainable to have a professional football club.“If it means postponing for a few weeks and looking after the safety of our players and fans, then so be it. The season doesnt start to next February or March so theres nothing set in stone. Were very fortunate that were not on any deadlines. For me, the safe option is to restrict but at the same time we know that we have a lot of football to be played this season and we have got to look at it that way and not panic.” googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Derry City boss Declan Devine has called for league postponement for the good of clubs, players and fansnecessary The English Premier League already postponed a game this week due to the spread of the virus and there are fears that the current campaign may have to be put on hold. No such pressure exists across the water however according to Devine.“We are in the fortunate position where there are no trophies getting handed out in five or six weeks time. Our trophies arent getting handed out for another nine or ten months. The panic doesnt need to set in here just yet. I think the health authorities have to take major decisions, but for me personally, whats right is right and I certainly dont want to be playing football in empty stadiums and clubs having to find money where its near enough impossible in dficult times to do.” googletag.cmd.push League actionIn the meantime, Devine and his staff must focus on tomorrow nights game against Sligo Rovers as the Candystripes look to bounce back from a poor display in Waterford last week. Despite a modestof four points from four games so far, City are favourites to beat a Sligo side who have lost all four games, but the City boss is expecting a big showing from Liam Biuckleys team.“I was impressed with Sligo against Rovers on Saturday,” he stated. I thought they were very unfortunate to lose to Finn Harps and I thought they were excellent against St. Pats. They have a lot of good players and there was a lot of close matches between us last year. Im expecting nothing other than a right, tough Northwest derby and Sligo will come here and enjoy playing on our pitch. No doubt they are coming here to put it up to us.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hes won four times at Cheltenham and while hes not the horse he was when finishing third in the  Stayers Hurdle, he is capable of plugging away and into a place here. At those odds, hes worth a small risk. : - There are too many positives to ignore here for A PLUS TARD  who won here last year for the in-form combination of Henry de Bromhead and Racheal Blackmore. With the Arkle and Mares Hurdle in the bag on day , its clear Henry De Bromhead has his horses in great form and this could mark his latest trip to the Prestbury Park winners enclosure. His three- defeat of Chacun Pour Soi is the best form in the book this year, confirmed by Mins loss to the same rival at Leopardstown last month. googletag.cmd.push : - Much like Envoi Allen on Wednesday, its hard to imagine anything other than Paisley park winning this race, but I cant tip up a   shot. For the place or eachway markets, SUMMERVILLE BOY  represents good value. He won the Supreme Novices Hurdle two years ago and, after a brief stint over fences, reverted to hurdles and easily accounted for Roksana over M F at this course in January. He stepped into a real top-class stayers field in the Cleeve Hurdle here later that same month and pushed Paisley Park all the way. I expect both of them to be coming up the hill side by side again and Id be surprisedthere was anything ahead of them. Summerville Boy is capable of pulling off the shock but Id be happy to see him place here. : - The brilliantly named SIMPLY THE BETTS  looks a good thing here given his form with Tuesday winner Imperial Aura at this course in January. Imperial Aura was a tidy winner of the Brown Advisory earlier this week but Simply The Betts accounted for that rival while giving him four pounds. Simply the Betts has been given an extra nine pounds for that win but is hugely progressive and has won three times in four races this season. I expect a gamble on this one so get on at the early prices. Vision Des Flosis one at a big price who will handle the ground and could stay into a place. : - In the same colours as Honeysuckle, MINELLA MELODY  could easily be a   shot for this race and could be another star in the making for Henry De Bromhead. The way this mare stayed on after being joined at the last in Fairyhouse in January was eye-catching. She extended and beat Colreevy, a promising sort in her own right, by more than two s. Minella Melody is unbeaten in three starts over hurdles and should be good enough to confirm that form and win here. : - Another one for a big eachway hope and FLYING ANGEL  gets a tentative nod. He won a weak enough contest by eight s at Ascot in November but was well beaten by Vintage Clouds subsequently. The biggest tick in his favour is his festival form. He was a game fth and just seven s behind Beware the Bear in the  Ultima over a similar distance. Hes sure to stay and will handle the testing ground. At a smaller eachway price, MILAN NATIVE  has a super chance for Gordon Elliott with a seven-pound claimer taking weight off his back. He was second to Allaho, albeit a - defeat, in a recent start and could be well handicapped going over this extended trip.

From his excitement I could tell this was a big deal. I know Derry bands have been there in the intervening years when it has become a showbiz show-off party for the desperately cool kids out there and band managers desperate to be taken seriously.It’s not a music festival in the traditional sense where you go and watch bands and enjoy yourself it’s a bit like the Output Festival in Belfast, which is what I imagine hell is going to be like, except on a much bigger scale.Think of someone in your dream job telling you how they’ve made it, so they’ll be there forever, and you know what I mean.This Friday, March , until Sunday the nd,atAustin Convention Centre, Austin, Texas, United Statesthe gloriously great bands and the good at getting attention for themselves rather than their bands will be out in force.It doesn’t matterthese bands don’t do anything other than support other bands —you say you’ve been to South By South West , then that should be enough to get taken seriously for a little while longer.Paddy went at the right time andEoin O’Callaghanadded to the sentiment saying he’s “delighted to see what all the fuss is about. It’s a coming together of all that is relevant — apparently — so we’ll be there”. In Eoin’s defence he and Ryan Vail have been out touring the planet with their Borders album and really do deserve the acknowledgement.Between them, this is their seventh album and very few local acts can say they’ve achieved what they have. Following their win at the Northern Ireland Music Prize last November among numerous other accolades and even a BBC documentary, Ryan Vail said: “South by South West has been one of the most important music industry events in the world. To be part of it this year feels great.”Eventhis is just a bunch of industry suits patting each other on the back then at least there’s a couple of fellas from Derry in the middle of them and justiably so, there will undoubtedly be acts in among them who haven’t had one album out and still have a heap of their singles stashed away somewhere.To be fair the slackers will inherit the earth.Also heading over areThe Wood Burning Savages,who used to be from Derry, but we still love them.Lead singer and guitaristPaul Connollytold me: “It’s a coup for a band from here to be invited, it’s the world’s largest international get together of musicians, producers, venues, festivals and the chances of falling in with the right people are quite high. “We’ve put in a lot of groundwork ahead of it and our previous tours and festival appearances have linked us up with some fantastic people who want to championTWBSin the US. We’re just looking forward to playing our shows, trying out some new songs as well as eating some hot wings and drinking a few cold beers with new friends too. Derry’s legendary Hammond organ player,Caolan McLaughlinis going to be out there with us too as luck would have it, so the craic will be mighty!”Out of curiosity,what have they got coming up “We’re currently working on our second album and experimenting with a lot of new sounds. We’ve also just been invited on tour with our buddies Ash, as they celebrate their th anniversary.” Twenty-five years: they’ve come a long way since battles of the bands in the Argyle and summer days in the Gasyard. Hands up who feels old Elliot Finlaywas the only other Savage to get back, adding: “We’re excited to have the opportunity to go over and play in the States and, hopefully, get a few more people over there to take notice of the good things that are happening in the Northern Ireland music scene at the minute.”Just while I’m on the subject, anyone remember the line “I’ve never been to America, but I’ve been in some states with you ”At least this year the bands representing the parish will have something to justy their being there. I’m sure Paddy Lynch will be there in spirit. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tickets for Horslips concert at St Columbs Hall on Saturday, March , sold out quickly.However another gig has been arranged for the following night and some tickets are still available for this.The weekend gigs will be a welcometo Derry for Horslips.When Barry, Johnny, Jim and Ray take the stage in St Columb’s Hall they will play the songs that gave them iconic status back in the ’s.“St Columb’s has huge signicance for us,” says flautist and keyboard player Jim Lockhart.“We played here a number of times in the turbulent seventies and the gigs were always intense, with audiences that really rocked. But it has a more recent importance in our story. You could call it crucial.”Guitarist Johnny Fean takes up the story.“We’d been off the road for  years and as far as anyone knew, that was that.“But Derryman Jim Nelis, joined by two friends, Paul Callaghan and Stephen Ferris, designed and curated an exhibition in the Orchard Gallery.“We agreed to come up and open it. And we got up on stage again to sing a couple of songs and liked it so much, we got back together: and we’ve been on the road ever since.”The last word is with Jim Lockhart.“We’re really looking forward to these very special gigs on what will be our th anniversary year.”As part of the concerts, a donation will be made by the band and promoter to local disability organisation Destined who provide a range of support services for people with learning disabilities.Destined is based at a new centre at Foyle Road which was recently damaged in an arson attack. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners. A best kept garden competition is another idea.The town committee hopes to tie all the events into Down Councilrsquos anti-litter campaign later this year when a prize of pound will be awarded to the best kept town or village in the council area.Some members of the town committee, however, fear Killyleagh could get off to a bad start in the competition because of the major housing redevelopment schemes at Shore Street and Irish Street, and the overall shabby appearance of roads and footpaths in the area.DUNDRUM mdash Ambitious plans to make Dundrum Regatta and Sports bigger and better were drawn at the Regatta Committeersquos annual meeting in the Bay Inn on Monday night.Ideas to cater for teenagers, introduce a more ied programme and revert to a date in mid July were considered at the well attended meeting.Before the election of officers, which saw Mr Hugh Graham re-elected as chairman and Mr Pierce Rice appointed secretary, the committee congratulated Mr Dan McNeill for his -year association with the committee,  of which were spent as chairman.One of the more pleasing aspects to come out of the meeting was the formation of a group, to be known as the teenage committee, which will should out what teenagers want to see in the programme of events, this ensuring young, middle-aged and elderly will be catered for. The dates for this yearrsquos Regatta are July -.LOUGHINISLAND mdash Loughinisland hasnrsquot had a public phone kiosk since it was knocked down by a lorry three years ago.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies. This support has helped secure almost poundm of investment and is helping companies to create , jobs, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoIn direct response to Mr Hazzardrsquos comment that our focus is solely directed at investors in Belfast, in the last five years nearly % of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast and nearly % of Invest NIrsquos offers are to companies outside of Belfast.The spokeswoman said it was solely a companyrsquos decision on where it wished to visit and locate, based on its business needs.She added: ldquoThe vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations or, in some cases, the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our headquarters in Belfast which is why the Belfast figures are high.ldquoSteering an investor to locate in any one area that does not meet their requirements would be both counterproductive and damaging to Northern Irelandrsquos investment reputation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Late RUGBY.jpg","title":"Late Lansdowne try leaves ‘Hinch in relegation spot  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH suffered heartbreak on Saturday in their battle to avoid relegation from the ultra competitive AIL Division A as their Dublin opponents stole the result at the death, despite a much-improved Ballynahinch performance.The articial surface at Aviva Stadiumrsquos back pitch was the venue and the large travelling support braved Storm Jorge to roar their men on.It looked like turning into a famous victory until powerful Leinster Academy hooker Dan Sheehan drove over in the dying moments of a hard-fought match to seal victory for the home side and avenge their seven try thumping at Ballymacarn Park in November.Brian McLaughlin had made a few changes to his starting back line with Aaron Cairns moving into scrum half and Greg Hutley earning his first AIL start at out half. Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead. It is too early to comment on inidual schemes in the absence of more certainty around budget availability to the Department in   and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 PD.jpg","title":"PD prepares for CrossFit Games  ","story":"A LEITRIM man is preparing to take on the worldrsquos best this summer in the CrossFit Games in the United States.PD Savage will represent Ireland in the five-day competition in Madison, Wisconsin, in July.

It started off with her forgetting things, not knowing how to get home in the car and we thought it was just a bad period of depression at first.ldquoShe literally went from being highly ing in work and at home to not being able to drive and being in a wheelchair in six months, thatrsquos how progressive the disease was.ldquoPeople usually die within five years of having this disease.

I did my first competition and then I got hooked. Itrsquos only now I realise how exercise and fitness helped deal with what was going on with my motherrsquos illness.PD is the current All Ireland CrossFit champion and recently ramped up his training.He said: ldquoIrsquom working out twice a day, six days a week.

It really has taken over my le at the moment and I guess it has really spiralled from initially being a hobby and slowly becoming more and more competitive.PD is halfway to raising the pound, he needs for being in the US for seven weeks leading up to the competition.He hopes to raise a further pound, for Alzheimerrsquos Research through some sponsored events in his gym and by the sale of event tee-shirts.To support PD, you can find him on social media s, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Roads.jpg","title":"Roads top agenda in public meeting  ","story":"A SERIES of roads issues topped the agenda at a public meeting in Newcastle last week.Organised by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local SDLP councillors, a number of people took part in the event at the Newcastle Centre.The public session is the first of many the SDLP plans to organise across the constituency to provide people with an opportunity to voice their concern on a iety of issues.Mr McGrath described last weekrsquos meeting and future events across the district as ldquonew activism with the focus on listening to and engaging with the community.He continued: ldquoWe had no ing Stormont Executive or Assembly for so long and we have had no accountability.

The school run. Feeding, dressing, washing, homework. Keeping my son entertained. Stories, dancing, games, wrestling, singing, reading. His constant need for stimulation burning my energy until all that’s left is a thin line of hazy black smoke.We’re in bed, covers pulled up tight to our chins. I’ve just finished the bedtime story and I haven’t got enough energy left to move him into his own room.I’m probably closer to sleep than him. He’s still talking, incessantly asking questions.

He’s been silent for a while so I assume he’s gone. But then.‘Daddy ’ his voice heavy and slow with the immediacy of sleep.‘Yes son ’‘What will we dream about tonight daddy ’It’s a ritual of his. Usually the last question of the day. Some infantile notion that his dreams can be controlled. That our stories are of our own choosing. It gives him some comfort. I’m spent. I don’t have much more creativity to give. I force myself to think of something.‘Why don’t we dream that we’re two planes racing high up in the sky,’ I whisper.There’s a short silence, ashe’s pondering the notion. His answer is barely audible.‘OK daddy.’And then he’s gone. His eyes have become dark rings. Sometimes he emits soft groans, sometimes he grinds his teeth. His mouth slightly open, yellow skin. The slightest discolouration where the vein runs along the temple. I move the back of my hand along his face, old skin against young. Rough touching smooth.Despite my extreme state of tiredness I don’t feel that I can settle. I try to read a book but the words on the page seem stale. I put it down and just lie there. Watching my son.I notice some animation enter his body. He turns in his sleep. Sometimes he reaches for me with his hand or foot, asto check I’m still there. There’s the occasional strangled giggle or whine. I know that something’s going on in his brain and I’d love to be able to read him now. It occurs to me that this sums up parenting, trying to understand what’s going on in his head.I imagine some sort of disparate narrative is probably being pulled together within him as a dream. Something which makes sense to only him, and even then only at this moment. He most likely won’t remember it in the morning. It’s probably already gone forever. Dreams can’t be captured like butterflies.When he’s awake he talks often about dreams, the fleeting scraps he remembers. The ideas that fill his head through the day. He often gives us a small glimpse of the scope of his imagination. The ideas, conundrums, concerns, questions, concepts. He talks about the future too, Recently he asked us ‘When I’m a daddy, who will be the mummy ’He’s chosen his career already. He says he wants to be a doctor and a scientist. It’s noble and serious. Maybe he will. Maybe he’ll change his mind dozens of times.But tonight my mind is tired from wondering and wandering. I settle down, letting the first stages of sleep caress me.It’s been years since I’ve remembered any of my dreams. Perhaps my mind just doesn’t work that way anymore. I get little hints occasionally, a teasing feeling or emotion, but I can never put the mirror back together.My brain feels worn, broken down, empty. I suppose there was a time when I had the energy to grow ideas and to order them. Now I just look at my son. When he sleeps. When he watches the TV, chewing slowly on a biscuit. When he’s with his friends, his face flushed with joy. I’m content that he is the realisation of my ambitions. The stick that all of my dreams would be measured against. We both sleep well.The morning is welcome and everything seems to work. My we is back home and my son is excitedly telling her all his adventures from the day before. The games, the dancing, the dream about the two planes racing high up in the sky.It’s a school and work day which brings its own feeling of urgency, a sense that things have to be done. But it’s also Friday and the sweetness of the weekend and the time together is close, reflecting onto all of us.I hurriedly get my son into his unorm and coat and he doesn’t really bother to complain. I brush his hair and clean his face. I take him outside, it’s definitely still winter but the weather seems more benign this morning. I’m fiddling with the straps of the car seat when he lets out an excited yell.‘Look daddy! Look in the sky!’I gaze upwards. There’s a flinty blue horizon and the beginning of a sunrise over the roofs of the distant houses, just a promise at this hour. And above, two clear lines cut across the sky like the silvery trails of flat slugs. They are parallel, even, moving away. At the edge of the contrails I can just about make out two aircraft that appear tinier than toys.My son is jumping up and down.‘Daddy, it’s our dream! It’s our dream! Two planes racing high up in the sky!’I lt him into his chair, checking the straps are secure. He’s still straining his neck to watch the distant planes. I warm the car and slowly reverse it down the driveway.‘You see daddy, I told you, dreams do come true.’‘You’re right son. You’re absolutely right.’\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

Victims are regularly kept updated on progress of investigations.ldquoWe are dedicated to making our communities even safer by preventing and reducing crime and building on our success in solving crime and seeking justice for victims.ldquoCompared to similar forces in the UK, South Wales Police is the best performing force on recorded crime and there is a  per cent lower chance of being a victim of crime in South Wales than where.ldquoThere was a  per cent year-on-year reduction in burglaries in the Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan area, where people are far less likely to become a victim of burglary than where in South Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Doubts are rising about what can come from the US government, though, even after President Donald Trump promised some aid.Investors know that lower interest rates or government spending programmes alone will not solve the crisis. Only the containment of the virus can do that.But such measures could help support the economy in the meantime, and investors fear things would be much worse without them.The Bank of England became the latest big central bank on Wednesday to make an emergency interest rate cut in hopes of blunting the economic pain caused by the virus, which economists call the global economyrsquos biggest threat.The stakes are rising as the World Health Organisation cited ldquoalarming levels of inaction by governments in corralling the virus when it made its pandemic declaration.ldquoThe government probably should have been thinking about stimulus last month, said Kristina Hooper, Invescorsquos chief global market strategist. ldquoEvery day that passes makes the economic impact of coronavirus that much worse.Many investors are worried that a ided Congress will have trouble agreeing to any plan, she said.Besides worries about the virus and the governmentrsquos ability to get something done for the economy, the market was also weighed down by a continued decline in oil prices, said Patrick Schaffer, global investment specialist at JP Morgan Private Bank.ldquoI want all retail investors to expect this environment will continue: sharp down days, sharp up days, he said. ldquoThis feeling of whiplash that people feel probably continues for some period of time.The speed of the marketrsquos declines and the degree of its swings the last few weeks have been breathtaking.

delay phase mean uk","story":"When Cobra meets on Thursday lunchtime, the Prime Minister is expected to advance preparations for combating the deadly virus by switching to tactics designed to delay its spread rather than contain the disease.It comes after the global Covid- outbreak was categorised as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation and eight people in the UK were confirmed to have died after contracting the illness.Here the PA news agency takes a closer look at the delay phase:What is the ldquodelay phase The delay phase will see a mixture of the same advice given out, such as encouraging the washing of hands regularly, while also introducing social restriction measures to slow the spread of the virus. those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect\" data-source\"Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer\"The Government has confirmed it will be guided by the experts about what the most effective measures for delaying the virus will be.How will it help deal with the outbreak The end goal of the delay phase is to slow the rate of coronavirus being contracted and allow the NHS to clear the annual winter pressure it faces.It would also provide a buffer to allow a possible vaccine to be found.The Governmentrsquos planning document explained: ldquoThe benefits are thatthe peak of the outbreak can be delayed until the warmer months, we can reduce signicantly the risk of overlapping with seasonal flu and other challenges, societal or medical, that the colder months bring.ldquoThe delay phase also buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines and or improved therapies or tests to help reduce the impact of the disease.What do they mean by social restrictions According to the Governmentrsquos published action plan, the restrictions being considered would have ldquosocial costs.These are thought to include urging employees to work from home where possible and even shutting down schools and cancelling events where masses of people will gather.ldquoSome of these will have social costs where the benefit of doing them to delay the peak will need to be considered against the social impact, said the Governmentrsquos action plan.Is it the same as what is happening in Italy and China The severity of the interventions have dfered on a country by country basis.China and Italy have put full scale lock downs in place, with court action and fines threatened for people breaking imposed curfews. vw,vw,px, px\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce that the UK has entered the delay phase in the bid to combat coronavirus Wuhan, the Chinese city of  million people, which was at the epicentre of the initial outbreak, temporarily shut down its public transport network.And in countries such as France and Spain, large public gatherings have been banned in a bid to prevent widespread contamination.Are sporting events at risk Football matches in the European countries, including Paris Saint-Germainrsquos Champions League tie against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday, have been played behind closed doors as a result of bans on gatherings of , people or more.But there is doubt about whether the UK would follow suit after the deputy chief medical officer suggested scientic research did not back up the decision to outlaw public events.Dr Jenny Harries, in a video exchange with the PM on Wednesday, said: ldquoIn general, those sorts of events and big gatherings are not seen to be something which is going to have a big effect, so we donrsquot want to disrupt peoplersquos lives.Why is the UK not doing the same as Italy Mr Johnson suggested the decisions had come about because ldquopoliticians and governments around the world are under a lot of pressure to be seen to act, so they may do things that are not necessarily dictated by the science.Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, came into DowningStreet to answer some of the most commonly asked questions on coronavirus. pic jByRhFFfatmdash Boris JohnsonMarch , Why has it taken so long to move from the contain phase to delay Ministers have regularly stated that implementing tough social clampdowns too early can prove counterproductive as the public could tire of the restrictions, but it appears the PM and his advisers feel the time is right to escalate delay preparations.Current advice, including washing hands and catching coughs and sneezes with tissues before binning them will continue during the delay period, as will trying to find and

And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
