I mean in the summer he said that everybody who needed treatment got the treatment that they required.\u0027He knew that that was a lie because he had been briefed by the chief scientific adviser and the chief medical officer himself about the first peak, and we were told explicitly people did not get the treatment they deserved, many people were left to die in horrific circumstances.\u0027On care homes, Mr Cummings told MPs Government talk of putting a shield around care homes was \u0027complete nonsense\u0027.\u0027We were told categorically in March (by Mr Hancock) that people would be tested before they went back to homes, we only subsequently found out that that hadn\u0027t happened.\u0027Now while the Government rhetoric was we have put a shield around care homes and blah blah blah, it was complete nonsense. Quite the opposite of putting a shield around them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.\u0027 Liz Kendall MP, Labour\u0027s shadow social care minister, said: \u0027Mr Cummings\u0027 comments have revealed what we knew all along – that the Government\u0027s \u0027protective shield\u0027 around care homes during this pandemic did not exist.\u0027Over 30,000 care home residents have died of coronavirus during this pandemic. 25,000 elderly people were discharged from hospitals to care homes without any tests whatsoever, and frontline care workers were left without PPE.\u0027The Government was much too slow to act to protect residents and staff. As we emerge from this pandemic Ministers must put in place a plan to transform social care and ensure that care homes never again face a crisis of this scale.\u0027Mr Cummings said that assurances given to him by Mr Hancock in January last year that pandemic preparations were brilliant \u0027were basically completely hollow\u0027. The former chief aide to the Prime Minister told the Commons committee he received a response from Health Secretary Matt Hancock assuring: \u0027We\u0027ve got full plans up to and including pandemic levels regularly prepared and refreshed, CMOs and epidemiologists, we\u0027re stress testing now, it\u0027s our top tier risk register, we have an SR bid before this.\u0027Mr Cummings told the committee: \u0027I would like to stress and apologise for the fact that it is true that I did this but I did not follow up on this and push it the way I should\u0027ve done.\u0027We were told in No 10 at the time that this is literally top of the risk register, this has been planned and there\u0027s been exercises on this over and over again, everyone knows what to do.\u0027And it\u0027s sort of tragic in a way, that someone who wrote so often about running red teams and not trusting things and not digging into things, whilst I was running red teams about lots of other things in government at this time, I didn\u0027t do it on this.\u0027If I had said at the end of January, we\u0027re going to take a Saturday and I want all of these documents put on the table and I want it all gone through and I want outside experts to look at it all, then we\u0027d have figured out much, much earlier that all the claims about brilliant preparations and how everything was in order were basically completely hollow, but we didn\u0027t figure this out until the back end of February.\u0027Dominic Cummings said scientists on Sage and officials in the Department of Health were \u0027completely wrong\u0027 to assume the British public would \u0027not accept the lockdown\u0027 or a test and trace system.He said: \u0027Those two assumptions were completely central to the official plan and were both obviously, completely wrong.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Staycations UK photographs famous landmarks","story":"Share this article          ‹ Slide me ›    Welsh wizardry: The Czech city of Kutna Hora (left) is pretty, but it is no match for the styling of Portmeirion (right) where iconic TV show The Prisoner was filmed           ‹ Slide me ›    Spantastic: California may have the famous mile-long Golden Gate Bridge (left(, but our heavenly Humber (right), which opened in 1981, is even longer           ‹ Slide me ›    The mauve the merrier: Loads of lush lavender at the Abbaye de Senanque in France (left) and at Norfolk Lavender Farm in Caley Mill (right)           ‹ Slide me ›    Brick by brick: China has its spectacular 12,000-mile Great Wall (left), but we’ve got Hadrian’s (right), which is steeped in history and drama  "},{"url":null,"title":"Britain set sunny 68F today start two week mini heatwave","story":"Share this article Some showers are expected to return Thursday evening and early on Friday morning before the warm weather returns just in time for the Bank Holiday weekend.Next week, Brits can expect warm, settled conditions which are likely to persist across many areas from Monday.

After seeing demand battered by the pandemic, aerospace manufacturer Airbus says the recovery is beginning. It’s alerted its suppliers to prepare for a steep acceleration in production of its popular A320 single-aisle passenger jets, as it sets target above pre-pandemic levels in two years time. The European aerospace group has confirmed plans to increase A320 output to 45 jets per month in the last quarter of this year, from 40 at present. It has also set suppliers a new target -- 64 a month by the second quarter of 2023, and wants to ensure it has the long term capacity in place. That’s above the 60month peak it hit in 2019, before Covid-19.  Airbus says it expect the commercial aircraft market to recover to pre-COVID levels between 2023 and 2025, led by the single-aisle segment.  Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, says this morning: Looking further ahead, Airbus is anticipating a “continued recovering market”. It also asking suppliers to “ enable a scenario” for production to expand further to 70 by the first quarter of 2024. And long term, it’s also investigating whether it could boost production to 75 by 2025.  This steep ramp up looks like a sign of confidence in the recovery of the aviation industry from the pandemic - with Covid-19 vaccinations enabling a pick-up in international tourism. Faury says Airbus wants its suppliers to be ready for the pick-up in demand.  Airbus is also slightly increasing its production goals for its small A220 jet, and the wide-body A350 - again, in a mix of provisional goals and firm plans.

However, in all the time that I’ve been immersed in music in its many different forms, I’ve never attempted to make my own. I had a keyboard when I was nine or 10, but that was as far as it went. The closest I came to getting into music production was when I worked at a music school and I was allowed to take a production course for free. But, sadly, I had to drop out because I had so much going on in my personal life. But the hunger is still there. I’ll often play tunes on my 21-month-old daughter’s musical toys. However, when it comes to trying my hand at music production, I struggle to know where to begin. There is an abundance of information available online, from simple beginners lessons, all the way up to advanced masterclasses for those wishing to brush up on their engineering skills. With the advancement and democratisation of music production technology over the past couple of decades, bedroom producers are commonplace and many of those who’ve become adept at making music kindly share their experiences online. Finding something relevant to meet my needs proves a tad overwhelming, however, and I get lost in a sea of waveforms, EQ tips and info on achieving a decent level of dB. So I turn to TikTok, using simple hashtag searches. The hashtag #MusicProductionBeginners brings up a host of user-generated videos that really help cut through the noise, so to speak. One of the producers I encounter is Kade, who posts TikTok videos under the handle @musicbykade. He manages to break down how music production works in perhaps the simplest way I’ve ever heard, hailing the convenience of loops – little repetitive clips of music that can be used as the foundation for myriad genres. For me, I was angling to try my hand at a bit of “doof doof” – loud electronic music centred on a bass-heavy kick drum. Kade’s video uses GarageBand, free software for Apple Mac users, but I use another free platform called Waveform. The basic premise and layout for most production software is the same, so I follow his succinctly delivered tip to download some loops, put them into Waveform and get started. He recommends a site called cymatics.fm, where there are free loops and I start downloading house music samples to finally take my first baby steps into the world of production. Another TikTok creator, Mikey C, drops a gem in his own series of production tips: “Here’s my best advice for first-time producers – your first songs are not going to be hits, so don’t spend forever on them,” he says. Nothing technical there, but it’s solid gold for anyone who has lofty ambitions and feels frustrated when they can’t match up to their favourite artist. Learning the basics is about exploration and experimentation, not relentlessly overworking your very first attempt at a track – Mikey C’s video was less than 30 seconds long, but his tip probably saved me hours and hours of fruitless tinkering. Another of his videos suggests reaching the chorus of a song within 45 seconds. “Anything later is going to be too long of a wait and you’re going to lose listeners,” he says. While I’m nowhere near making a song yet, it’s incredibly useful to have an experienced producer share a key tip that’s easily remembered. On my hashtag travels, I stop off at Sarah Maddack’s account. Maddack has more than a million followers and describes herself as “the silliest rapper you know”. Her comedic approach is immediately disarming. Not afraid to laugh at herself, she explains how to create the sound of a “crowd” screaming by recording different types of screams with your own voice, and then layering them to create a multi-scream, group effect. I have a microphone, which I usually use to record podcasts and radio shows, so I decide to put it to use in my new producer “lab” and record my own voice. Another video I find incredibly helpful is a demonstration of how to make field recordings from TikTok creator Arthur Caplan. “You’ve reached sound design TikTok,” says the text on his video. There’s no talking, just text explaining what he’s doing. So I take my dictaphone outside to get some recordings of the trains going past on the local line, birds chirping in the trees, and the trusty sounds of people running. The simplicity of the tips I discover on TikTok have helped me take the plunge into a world that I had always felt some trepidation towards. I’ve learned that music production doesn’t have to be this grand expedition, where you spend hours meticulously arranging and creating sounds. It can be as basic as recording the sound of leaves blowing in the wind, grabbing some premade loops and basslines, talking into a mic, uploading it all into your production software and simply having fun with it. Just don’t ask me to play any of the “music” I’ve made so far. "},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown is lifting could tiktok help you re learn how to socialise","story":"The reality was, as much as I longed to see my friends and my family, the thought of getting back out there was a daunting prospect. Feelings of self-doubt and a sudden lack of confidence consumed me. Like many people, I’ve been wondering how to actually socialise again. My anxiety levels have skyrocketed. Lockdown has played tricks with my ego and confidence. The question has been what to do about it. As a busy mum-of-three, I don’t exactly have bags of spare time. During lockdown I’d become intrigued by TikTok. I’d looked at some of the uplifting videos that had gone viral and grabbed the whole world’s attention. But I sensed there was more to TikTok than just dance fads. Could its wealth of videos about every subject under the sun help me regain my social skills and self-confidence? I start my exploration of motivational TikTok videos by granting myself permission for some basic “me time”. Given my hectic schedule, I’ve never really been one for so-called “me time” – but watching and listening to some everyday women with little sprinklings of genius on TikTok really made me stop and think: hold on, it is actually about me. “You can’t give to your family from an empty cup,” explains TikTok creator @ivanarichey – one of her many short and snappy pearls of wisdom. I scoffed at it at first, and thought what a cliche. But then I realised that, actually, if I go down, then pretty much the whole ship goes down too. From then on, whenever I could grab five minutes in between the school run and dinnertime, I’d have a quick browse at some other motivational accounts to give me that extra perk I needed to make it through to bedtime. “Compliment yourself, praise yourself,” says TikTok creator @spencer.barbosa, whose motivational gems and quick and quirky style tips will perk you up in an instant. Another of her quotes that I loved was: “You don’t have to be the best, just be the best version of yourself.” I don’t know what it was that made me more receptive to heeding advice in this format. It could have been the sincerity and authenticity of the TikTok creators themselves. It could have been their uplifting vibe or disarming humour. Or it could have been the snappy, no-nonsense format. But pretty soon, I was hooked. I honestly hadn’t actually realised until now just how important and effective it is to consciously lift yourself up, dust off that crown, and so on. Suddenly, the prospect of seeing my friends and socialising again after nearly 18 months didn’t seem so daunting. One of the things I used to love doing before lockdown was get a makeover in the lead-up to a glam event. Given that this has not been an option for quite some time, I wondered if I’d ever be glam again and didn’t want to shock people when they saw me in person. I realised I was a far cry from my filtered image on social media. So I started scrolling for quick makeovers for those of us with not much time to spare. And @thepatriciabright was just the tonic I needed to give me the lift to get my face back on and get back out there. Her videos were great for providing seemingly instant glam, and they were so funny, too – especially when she teamed up with her hubby for a parody clip. It’s amazing what a sprinkling of gold dust over your cheekbones can do. And makeup artist @dominiqueallison taught me some awesome mum tricks to hide those bags by putting a slick of concealer on over your foundation. She also whipped up some funky retro looks for when we are allowed to go #outout again. I’m also a big fan of videos posted by @jaimykoroma and @werejagreeneyes, which had me in hysterics with her life hacks in ultra-short, 10-second videos. A change was coming and it didn’t have to be scary. Something remarkable was happening. Thanks to TikTok, I realised I could love life – and myself – after lockdown.

Merlino said it would be a matter for the federal government on whether the vaccine would be available for those in that age group at GP surgeries, but said the decision was arrived at due to frustration over the slow pace of the vaccine rollout. “If we had the vaccine, the commonwealth’s vaccine program effectively rolled out, we may well not be here today talking about these circuit-breaker restrictions that we must impose to keep our community safe.” Read more here: Victoria’s hotline for booking Covid vaccines crashes after being inundated with calls The deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre confirmed the investigation would include any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese lab. “China wasn’t transparent enough,” she said. “We have been saying that for a very long time, that China needed to provide more access to the lab, cooperate more fully with the scientific investigators.” Read more here: Washington Post – The Wuhan lab-leak theory is getting more attention.

Health and welfare minister Chen Chih-Shung said most of the fatalities were elderly people. More than half of the new cases were in people under the age of 40, including 45 children aged up to nine. The new cases remain concentrated in the northern cities of New Taipei and Taipei. Issues with Taiwan’s test recording system has resulted in a backlog of thousands of results, with clearance work producing hundreds of cases to revised totals each day, making it difficult to determine clear trends. The number of backlogged cases is reportedly still growing as more tests come in, despite clearance efforts. Taiwan remains under a level 3 alert, which is not a full lockdown but instead restricts personal gatherings to five indoors and 10 outdoors, encourages but does not require working from home, and which has ordered entertainment and recreation venues to close. Yesterday restaurants were ordered to transition to takeaway services only. Alarmed by their first significant outbreak since the pandemic began, Taiwan’s population has largely complied with both mandatory and requested restrictions, staying home and avoiding travel. Almost 1500 people are in centralised quarantine facilities, established for people with asymptomatic or mild cases of Covid-19 to reduce pressure on hospitals - several of which have recorded their own clusters of infections. That’s UK health minister Matt Hancock leaving his house this morning, being asked if the country can still have confidence in him. It was a suit today, not his running gear like yesterday. Hancock is to answer urgent questions in parliament at 10.30am and will later lead a Downing Street press conference, likely to be around 17.00.AFP state that the companies reported positive results from interim human trials earlier this month after a disappointing outcome from initial studies last year left France without its own vaccine. Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline have started enrolment for Phase 3 of a clinical study that will include more than 35,000 adult volunteers at sites in the United States, Asia, Africa and Latin America, the firms said. Sanofi and GSK will also study their vaccine’s ability to work as a booster shot in people who had previously received another vaccine. The Phase 2 trials already showed a strong immune response after a single shot in participants who had previously contracted the coronavirus. The companies hope to launch their vaccine by the end of 2021 - one year after Pfizer and Moderna jabs were approved by regulators. “We have adapted our vaccine development strategy based on forward-looking considerations as the virus continues to evolve, as well as anticipating what may be needed in a post-pandemic setting,” Sanofi executive vice president Thomas Triomphe said in a statement. Like most of the other jabs in circulation, the Sanofi-GSK vaccine would require two doses.President Tsai Ing-wen said Taiwan had made successful deals for AstraZeneca from the UK and Moderna from the US, and were engaging with Germany’s BioNTech for the Pfizer vaccine. “We had almost completed the contract signing with the German manufacturer at one point, but it has been delayed till now because China has interfered,” Tsai told a party meeting on Wednesday, in the most explicit comments to date, after months of suggestions that Beijing had been getting in the way of Taiwan’s procurement process. Pfizer-BioNTech reportedly has an exclusive deal with the Shanghai-based Fosun pharmaceuticals company to distribute the vaccine to the Greater China region, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. Fosun has offered to supply Taiwan with vaccine doses, but Taiwan has said it is not possible. Beijing denies obstructing Taiwan’s deal with BioNtech and has accused Taiwan’s leaders of sacrificing the health of residents for politics. Taiwan’s opposition Kuomintang party has accused Tsai of bungling the vaccine rollout. “Taiwan access to vaccines continues to be slowed down by Chinese interference, while they insist we buy Chinese-made ones,” said Taiwan’s presidential spokeswoman, Kolas Yotaka. “If you really want to help, please don’t stand in the doorway, don’t block up the hall.” Read more here: Taiwan accuses China of interfering with Covid vaccine deals She went on to say: She also made a value for money argument about scientific advice being sidelined, saying: “I think it’s important for the public to know how taxpayers money is being spent, because obviously there’s a substantial expense to serving a big scientific infrastructure.” Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme when the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), of which he was part, determined that a policy of pursuing herd immunity would lead to a vast number of deaths, he said a key meeting was held with the NHS on 1 March “which finalised estimates around health impacts, so the week after that really.” PA report Ferguson said he “wasn’t privy to what officials were thinking within government”, but added: “I would say from the scientific side there was increasing concern that week leading up to the 13 of March about the lack of clear, let’s say, (a) resolved plan of what would happen in the next few days in terms of implementing social distancing.” He said: “I think one of the biggest lessons to learn in such circumstances is we really need good surveillance within the country at a much earlier point than we actually had it back in March last year. As we saw the data build up, and it was matching the modelling, even worse than the modelling, let’s say it focused minds”. He then said locking down a week earlier would have saved 20,000 to 30,000 lives “and I think that’s unarguable. I mean the epidemic was doubling every three to four days in weeks 13th to 23rd of March, and so had we moved the interventions back a week we would have curtailed that and saved many lives”. Needless to say, lockdown sceptic Fraser Nelson, editor of the Spectator, is having none of it. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I am delighted that our vaccination programme is now open to all adults in Northern Ireland. I know this will be very welcome news for young people who have been waiting patiently for their turn to get the jab.” You can check on the latest status of vaccination in all of the UK’s constituent countries here: "},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Growing awareness of climate change among consumers drives corporate movesYou could set your watch by many biological events, but not anymoreState is offering \u0026euro2bn in support to electricity generators over the next decade through the Renewable Energy Support Scheme"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Return would be a great success for Bord na M\u0026oacutena\u0026rsquos peatland bioersity measures"},{"url":null,"title":"supermoon lights up irish skies on wednesday night","story":"Last night’s  supermoon over Ireland’s Eye, off Howth Harbour in north Dublin. Photograph: David BehanA supermoon lit up the Irish skies last night, while in some other countries people got to experience the rare sight of a “super blood moon”.A supermoon is a full or “new” moon that appears when the moon is closest to the Earth in its orbit. During the event, the moon usually appears about 15 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter.The May supermoon coincided with a lunar eclipse which saw the moon turn red but that was only visible in parts of world including South America, Australia and South-East Asia.A blood moon occurs when the moon sits directly in the Earth’s shadow and is struck by light filtered through the Earth’s atmosphere.“A little bit of sunlight skims the Earth’s atmosphere,” explained Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist and cosmologist based at the Australian National University in Canberra. He said this creates the effect of “sunrise and sunset being projected onto the moon.”Depending on your vantage point and the amount of dust, clouds and pollution in the atmosphere, he added, the moon appears pink-orange or burned red or even a brown colour.“A super poo moon doesn’t really have the same ring,” he remarked.Sky gazers in eastern Australia caught the eclipse beginning around 6.47pm local time Wednesday. Some took to the skies on a special flight to see the supermoon.Vanessa Moss, an astronomer with Australia’s national science agency, noted that because a lunar eclipse occurred in the Earth’s shadow, only those on the “night side of the Earth” could experience it. Places like Europe and the east coast of the US missed out.In all, there are 12 “full moons” every year. This is where the word “month” came from as early civilisations broke the yearly calendar into the 12 moons of the year, Astronomy Ireland’s David Moore explained.Each full moon has an unofficial folklore name, usually taken from North American folklore. The best known is the Harvest Moon in September, with the May full moon being known as the Flower Moon.For those who miss the supermoon on Thursday, a fourth and final supermoon of 2021 will be visible on June 24th. – Additional reporting New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

He added: “We know there are new variants spreading in Europe. There are new variants spreading in the UK. There are relatively high case rates in a number of European countries.”Prof McLysaght said the uncertainty surrounding the transmissibility of the Indian variant means it is worth waiting a number of weeks to observe what occurs in the UK, which is also reopening society while the variant is in circulation.“In a few weeks it will be quite clear,” she said. “It will either be that something unusual happened in Bolton – bad luck and a few different factors coinciding – or there is some biological feature of the variant that makes it more transmissible.“The price of waiting those few weeks to have more certainty is quite slim – it’s a holding pattern – but the potential cost of opening up now, if it is as bad as it might be, is really huge, and I think that’s a point that needs to be made quite clearly.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus 448 new cases reported in the state","story":"The Department of Health said that the daily number of cases may change due to future data validation.

Keep windows and doors open where possible and avoid cramped, crowded settings.”Wednesday saw the eighth consecutive day in Northern Ireland where no further deaths of patients who had previously tested positive for Covid-19 were notified.The Department of Health said another 66 positive cases had been confirmed, while there were 28 Covid-positive patients in hospital, of whom two were in intensive care. – PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"edwin poots says north south relations have never been worse","story":"The incoming DUP leader Edwin Poots was answering questions in the Assembly on Tuesday in his capacity as the North’s Minister for Agriculture. Photograph: PAThe incoming DUP leader has claimed in the Stormont Assembly that North-South relations have “never been worse”.He was answering questions in the Assembly on Tuesday in his capacity as the North’s Minister for Agriculture.“As a consequence of that every home is being damaged, and on the Executive’s papers . . . in every area of health, in medical devices and medicines we are in the red zone, that is a zone that we have been put there as a result of the protocol which was driven very heavily by the former taoiseach and tánaiste,” Mr Poots claimed.Reassurances“So Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland relations are very bad and they need to be fixed, but we need to get some reassurances that we’re going to get something considerably better than we currently are in terms of protocol to fix those relations.”The North’s Minister for Agriculture, Nichola Mallon, said on Tuesday that she had sought legal advice over the DUP’s boycott of some North-South Ministerial Council meetings as part of its campaign against the Northern Ireland protocol.Unionists are opposed to the protocol because it places a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea, and Mr Poots has pledged that as DUP leader he will take a tougher stance against the protocol.The absence of the DUP has meant that some of the council’s meetings have been unable to take place.“I understand the DUP are having new leadership but, regardless of who the leader is, they have legal responsibilities and I am so concerned by this matter that I have sought legal advice from the attorney general on this particular issue,” Ms Mallon said.Mr Poots was speaking in the Assembly in response to a question from the SDLP Assembly member (MLA) Patsy McGlone, who asked him to “confirm that he would not obstruct any further North-South meetings”.Defend recordThe incoming DUP leader also said he “remained committed to all of my duties as a Minister in this devolved assembly” and went on to defend his record on North-South co-operation, citing his role as a former minister for health in the establishment of a cross-Border radiotherapy service at Altnagelvin hospital in Derry and the agreement that paediatric cardiac patients from the North could receive surgery in Dublin.Asked by the DUP MLA Keith Buchanan for the staffing cost incurred at Northern Ireland’s ports because of the implementation of the protocol, Mr Poots said the figure came to almost £24.5 million (€28.3 million) since June 2020.Meanwhile, the DUP met David Frost, the UK minister responsible for EU relations, on Tuesday and called again for the replacement of the protocol.DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson said there had been a “direct and forthright exchange of views” and they had made clear that the UK government “must act carefully but decisively to restore the delicate balance of community relations in the coming days”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"limit non essential cross border travel north s chief medical officer says","story":"Dr Michael McBride said health authorities in the North recognised that people living in Border communities needed to cross the border for work, education and family reasons. File photograph: Kelvin BoyesPress EyePA WireThe North’s chief medical officer has appealed to people in the Republic to limit non-essential travel to Northern Ireland. Dr Michael McBride said there was “no doubt” non-essential cross-border trips were “contributing to some of the increased incidence of infection that we’re seeing in Derry City and Strabane and in the Newry and Mourne areas”. Speaking at a press briefing on Wednesday, Dr McBride said that while the health authorities in the North recognised that people living in Border communities needed to cross the border for work, education and family reasons, “in terms of those who are travelling for non-essential reasons it would be preferable from a public health point of view that that sort of travel was limited at this time”. The public health rationale for this, he said, was the “higher incidence of the infection in the Republic of Ireland at this time ... and we also have a very different rate of rollout of vaccination, although I think that gap will probably close significantly over the summer. “I think we just need to make sure we keep each other safe, recognising that we’re in different places at this moment and hopefully those differences will become less over time,” he said. Dr McBride’s comments were echoed by the North’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Lourda Geoghegan, who said that that in regard to discretionary or non-essential travel “we would ask people to assess their journeys – if they really want to take them, if they really need to take them, and if they’re doing so in a safe manner”. Northern Ireland’s lockdown restrictions were substantially lifted on Monday, with the full reopening of the hospitality industry both indoors and outdoors. People are also allowed to meet inside private homes for the first time since Christmas. Under the rules which came into force on May 24th, travel to Northern Ireland from within the Common Travel Area is permitted, though the advice is that if visitors plan to remain for at least 24 hours they should self-isolate for ten days, unless subject to a number of exemptions. These include work, education and visits to family and friends, as well as – for those who live in Border counties – buying essential goods and services within a local area. A further 66 positive cases of Covid-19 have been identified in the North, the Northern Ireland Department of Health said on Wednesday. There were no additional fatalities A total of 28 people were receiving hospital treatment for Covid-19, with two in intensive care. The North’s Minister for Health said on Wednesday that he plans to announce the extension of the Covid-19 vaccination programme in Northern Ireland to 18 to 24-year-olds “in the very near future.” So far more than 70 per cent of the adult population of Northern Ireland have received their first dose of the vaccine, and more than 40 per cent have been given both doses. A total of 15 cases of the so-called Indian variant of Covid-19 have been identified in Northern Ireland, but Dr McBride said there was no evidence of sustained community transmission of the mutation. However with the potential for increased travel over the summer he said it was likely this figure would increase, and it “may in due course” become the dominant variant. Meanwhile the “new technology” of waste water testing is being used to track cases of Covid-19, with an estimated 38 per cent of the waste water in the North’s sewage system currently being tested at 13 different sites to determine where the virus is present. Dr Geoghegan said it was potentially more effective than relying on people who have contracted the virus to come forward. “The benefit with waste water surveillance is that regular testing of the water is telling us for a geographical area if there is Covid in the area or not, and secondly it can tell us if there is a variant of concern in a particular area,” she said.

Photograph: Carlos CostAAFP via GettyCovid welfare and business supports will not be scaled back until the autumn at the earliest, senior Government figures said on Wednesday, suggesting that the multi-billion euro expenditure on the schemes could continue until the end of the year.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Fine Gael parliamentary party on Wednesday night there would be no “dramatic changes” in the third quarter of the year but added that the Government would next week outline how it intended to phase out the payments from the fourth quarter.Speaking at the Institute of Directors on Wednesday, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said “continued support could be necessary out to the end of 2021 to help maintain viable businesses and employment, and to provide businesses with certainty”.However, he added that “while there will be no cliff-edge, there must be an end to them at the right point”.The three main Covid support schemes – the wage subsidy scheme, the PUP and the Covid Restrictions Support Scheme, which gives cash to businesses forced to close – are all due to lapse on June 30th. However, the Government will announce next week that all three are to be extended when it unveils its plan for economic recovery in the post-Covid era. The schemes have cost more than €14 billion to date. The cabinet economic committee will meet today to discuss next week’s plan.The signal that the schemes will be extended comes amid a sense in Government that the country is entering the final phase of the acute Covid crisis. Removing these supports now, Mr Donohoe said on Wednesday, “would be akin to falling at the final hurdle”.Officials and Ministers are engaged in detailed preparations for the announcement of the next, extensive phase of the reopening of commercial and social life on Friday.Final approvalThe National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) met on Wednesday to discuss issues relating to the reopening plan. On Thursday, the Cabinet sub-committee on Covid-19 will meet senior public health and health service officials for discussions on the plan, while the three leaders of the Coalition parties will also meet to consider the plans. The Cabinet will then meet on Friday to give final approval of the plan, after which Taoiseach Micheál Martin will announce the reopening measures.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly met the chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, on Wednesday evening following the Nphet meeting and sources reported that the two men had a positive and constructive meeting.Nphet has concerns about the risks presented by the Indian variant and also discussed the intensity of some local outbreaks. These concerns are likely to form part of Nphet’s advice to Government, though it is understood the outlook from the body remains broadly positive.Easing of restrictionsOn Wednesday night Mr Donnelly indicated that Nphet had cleared the way for the further easing of restrictions.“I’m very happy to report, and I’m sure members will be aware, that Nphet’s view is that the trajectory is positive thanks to the Irish people getting behind the measures day after day after day and keeping those case numbers and hospitalisations low,” he told the Dáil.While Mr Varadkar on Wednesday night warned of the danger of a fourth wave of the virus – telling Fine Gael TDs the country is “not out of the woods yet” – Friday’s announcement is likely to proceed along expected lines, according to sources involved in the process."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland becomes first eu country to declare israel is involved in de facto annexation","story":"Palestinians sit around a fire between their families’ destroyed houses in Beit Hanoun town, northern Gaza Strip, on Wednesday.

The Dáil rejected, however, a proposal to expel the Israeli ambassador to the Republic and impose comprehensive sanctions against Israel by 87 votes to 46, with no abstentions.A spokesman for Israel’s foreign ministry said it “outright rejects” the motion.Lior Haiat said on Twitter that Ireland’s “outrageous and baseless” position regarding some Israeli settlements reflects a “blatantly one-sided and simplistic policy” and constitutes a “victory for extremist Palestinian factions”. “The motion distances Ireland from its ambition to contribute and play a constructive role in the Israeli-Palestinian context,” he wrote.Mr Haiat said the vote followed “unacceptable anti-Israel statements that were heard in Ireland at a time when the citizens of Israel were being subject to terror attacks by the more than 4,000 rockets that were launched from the Gaza Strip by the Hamas terrorist organization.”The Government had in a debate on Tuesday night supported the Sinn Féin proposal and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said during debate on the issue that “we need to be honest with what is happening on the ground and call it out” as “de facto annexation”.He added that the Republic is the first EU country to state this and it could be a message to the global community.Mr Coveney echoed the comments of Sinn Féin foreign affairs spokesman John Brady, who said that “we are baldly stating that Israel is acting illegally under international law”.Sinn Féin had accepted for their motion a Government amendment condemning the actions of militant Palestinian group Hamas.Cabinet meetingA Cabinet meeting was held on Tuesday and agreed to back the Sinn Féin proposal if the party included reference to violence “on all sides in the conflict”, following intense violence in the Gaza region over the past two weeks before a ceasefire was called.More than 240 Palestinians have been killed in the outbreak of violence, including 66 children, with 10 Israeli deaths, including two children.Mr Coveney had said he found it “deeply troubling” that Sinn Féin could not bring itself to also condemn the actions of Hamas for also killing children and innocent civilians.However, when the Minister insisted in Tuesday’s debate on the condemnation of “the killing of civilians by both sides in this conflict”, Sinn Féin accepted this amendment without a vote.People Before Profit had introduced the amendment calling for the ambassador’s expulsion to the Sinn Féin motion. The Dáil passed the Sinn Féin motion itself on Wednesday night.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, speaking before the vote on his party’s amendment, described it as “historic” and said that it was the first time the Irish parliament would vote on the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.“Most likely it is the first time any parliament in the EU has held such a vote,” he said.Amendment wordingThe rejected amendment stated that “the Israeli apartheid system through its ongoing ethnic cleansing, brutal state repression and murderous military violence, including four savage military assaults on Gaza in recent years, has no place among the international community of nations”.It called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and “all Israeli diplomatic staff”, as well as for the application of “a comprehensive package of economic, political and cultural sanctions against the state of Israel, similar to that applied to apartheid South Africa”.The amendment also called for the maintenance of such sanctions and their promotion within the EU and internationally “until the entire Israeli apartheid system is dismantled and all the Palestinian people enjoy national self-determination and full and equal rights”.

Video: The White HouseJoe Biden has ordered the US intelligence community to intensify its efforts to study the origins of coronavirus, adding that it will continue to press for China to participate in a full investigation.The US president said he received a report earlier this month with the “most up-to-date analysis of the origins of Covid-19”, but had asked intelligence agencies to “redouble” their efforts to identify a “definitive conclusion” on how the virus was first transmitted in humans.“I have now asked the intelligence community to redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days. As part of that report, I have asked for areas of further inquiry that may be required, including specific questions for China,” Mr Biden said in a statement on Wednesday.The novel coronavirus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and has since spread around the world, killing almost 3.5 million people and infecting almost 168 million, according to Johns Hopkins. Much remains unknown about its origins and China has been sensitive about any suggestion it could have done more in the early stages of the pandemic to stop it.Mr Biden’s request included asking the US intelligence community to explore the unlikely possibility that the origins of the virus trace to Chinese lab. After months of minimising the possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is responding both to domestic and geopolitical concerns about putting pressure on China to be transparent about the outbreak.Republicans, including former president Donald Trump, have promoted the theory that the virus emerged from a laboratory accident, rather than naturally through human contact with an infected animal.Mr Biden’s request comes days after the Wall Street Journal broke the news of a previously undisclosed US intelligence report about three Wuhan researchers being hospitalised with coronavirus-like symptoms in November 2019. The report intensified public speculation that the virus began spreading as a result of a laboratory accident.In his statement, Mr Biden said the majority of the US intelligence community had “coalesced” around those two likely scenarios but “do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other”. He revealed that two of the 18 intelligence agencies lean toward the animal link and “one leans more toward” the lab theory, adding, “each with low or moderate confidence”.‘Transparent international investigation’Mr Biden directed US national laboratories to assist with the investigation and called on China to co-operate with international inquiries into the origins of the pandemic. Mr Biden said he has also asked the intelligence community to keep Congress apprised of its work on the matter.“The United States will also keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence,” he said.Earlier this year China refused to authorise a fact-finding mission to the country by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to study the origins of Covid-19. The move came amid Beijing’s attempts to reshape the narrative of where the disease originated.Asked if the US intelligence community has ruled out the possibility of a deliberate release of coronavirus, deputy White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre replied: “We haven’t ruled out anything yet.”Speaking on Wednesday, she repeatedly emphasised that the administration will have more information to offer on the investigation into the origins of coronavirus once the review is completed.Ms Jean-Pierre repeatedly criticised China for not being transparent with its information on the origins of the virus, echoing comments from other senior administration officials and international leaders.White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Tuesday that the White House supports a new WHO investigation in China, but added it “would require China finally stepping up and allowing access needed to determine the origins.”Mr Biden, for his part, held out the possibility that a firm conclusion may never be known, given the Chinese government’s refusal to fully cooperate with international investigations.“The failure to get our inspectors on the ground in those early months will always hamper any investigation into the origin of Covid-19,” he added in his statement Wednesday.On Wednesday evening, the US Senate passed a bill that seeks to declassify federal information relating to the origins of Covid-19.Elsewhere, Facebook announced it was lifting a ban on posts claiming that Covid-19 was “man-made”, saying in a statement to Axios that the decision was made “in light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts”. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

Meanwhile several countries with large Syrian refugee populations, including Turkey and Germany, have blocked voting.The vote is taking place in defiance of a 2015 United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a new constitution ahead of elections but a collapsing regional commitment to the resolution has seen increasing numbers of Arab states accept the sham elections as evidence of a genuine political transition.Last month Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry claimed that the vote would allow the Syrian people to “choose their future and form a government that represents them.”States like Egypt may cite the election as reason to readmit Syria to the Arab League, from which it was suspended in November 2011. While sclerotic and functionally irrelevant, Syria’s readmission to the body would symbolise the completion of Assad’s regional rehabilitation, a process that has progressed significantly in the past few years.The United Arab Emirates, which once supported Syrian rebels, reopened its embassy in Damascus in December 2018, followed shortly afterwards by Bahrain. The move reflected growing Arab concern over their diminished role in Syria amid the growing influence of Turkey and Iran.Even Saudi Arabia is making overtures towards Damascus, earlier this month dispatching intelligence chief Gen Khalid Humeidan for the first known meeting with his Syrian counterpart since the start of the war. The regional impact of Syria’s collapsing economy may be driving re-engagement. More than 80 per cent of Syria’s population now live in poverty amid runaway inflation. A recent survey carried out in the capital showed that nearly two in three Damascenes want to emigrate, with the majority citing declining living standards as the biggest factor.Suffering under sanctions and saddled with debt, the government has turned on former regime insiders for shakedowns. Among those targeted is Assad’s cousin Rami Makhlouf, once known as Mr Five Per Cent for the cut he was reputed to take from any new business venture.A new class of warlords, smugglers and racketeers has taken the place of the former business elite. The country now produces so much of the methamphetamine captagon that experts describe Syria as a narco-state.In April, Saudi customs intercepted millions of dollars of captagon hidden in pomegranates arriving from Lebanon, which is a conduit for Syrian drug exports. The find alarmed Saudi officials enough that they banned imports of produce from Lebanon, which is suffering its own economic collapse.While the West continues to oppose the vote, their words will be powerless to halt the process. “A legitimate election can only follow an inclusive and transparent process” – as laid out by the UN Security Council in resolution 2254 – “where all eligible voters can take part, free from intimidation,” said Jonathan Hargreaves, UK Special Representative for Syria.Assad responded to those views on Wednesday by saying that Syria would disregard them. The “value of those opinions is zero,” he said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"batley grammar teacher allowed back school prophet mohammed","story":"The Batley Grammar teacher who showed a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed in class will be allowed to return to the classroom but the picture should not be used again in any lesson, the Trust has said.The Religious Studies (RS) teacher, who was forced into hiding after receiving death threats, had not intended to cause offence, an investigation into the incident found.The investigation, commissioned by the Batley Multi Academy Trust, found that the teacher “genuinely believed” that the image had “an educational purpose and benefit”.The Trust said it was not necessary to use pictures of the Prophet Muhammed in RS lessons or any other lessons out of “respect” for the views of the school community.It added that it will not avoid addressing challenging subject matter but at the same time is committed to ensuring that offence is not caused. Critics have warned that teachers should not face a religious veto on what material they can use in the classroom, adding that the Trust\u0027s stance is a route to censorship. Batley Grammar School  sent pupils home early for the Easter holidays and issued an apology after a group of Muslims gathered at the gates to protest.The headmaster announced that  the Religious Studies teacher had been suspended while the school looked into what happened.The teacher - who was branded a “terrorist” by one Muslim community leader - reportedly said he feared he and his family would be murdered and that he would never be able to return to his job or home.The academy trust that runs Batley Grammar School then announced that it would carry out an independent investigation into the context in which the cartoon was shown.Stephen Evans, chief executive of the National Secular Society,  said he welcomes the decision to lift the teachers\u0027 suspensions. “But the trust’s stated commitment to ensuring offence is not caused is a route to censorship, and sets a very poor precedent, he said.  “The outcome of this local investigation will affect teachers’ ability to do their jobs across the country. So the government should face questions over its failure to show leadership when fundamental principles were at stake. “Teachers must be able to explore challenging issues in the classroom and shouldn\u0027t face a religious veto on which resources they can use.”The Trust\u0027s full report was not published but the executive summary cited guidelines from the Department for Education which state that schools are allowed to include a range of ideas and materials in lessons, including where they are “challenging or controversial”.The report said that schools must balance this with the need to promote respect and tolerance between people of different faiths and beliefs, including in deciding which materials to use in the classroom. The investigators said that “great care must be taken” that lessons featuring controversial topics are taught in a way that “promotes respect and tolerance between people of different faiths, beliefs and values”.The report went on to say: “In the light of the above, and in respect of the views of our school community the Trust is clear that it is not necessary for staff to use the material in question to deliver the learning outcomes on the subject of blasphemy or any such images of the type used on 22 March for use in any Trust RS lessons, or any other lessons”.Batley Multi Academy Trust said it accepts all the report’s recommendations, adding: “The findings are clear, that the teaching staff involved did not use the resource with the intention of causing offence, and that the topics covered by the lesson could have been effectively addressed in other ways.“In the light of those conclusions, the suspensions put in place while the investigation was underway will now be lifted.” It is not known whether the teachers will return to the classroom. A spokesman for the Trust added: The Trust deeply regrets the distress caused by the use of this resource, and we would like to thank all of the Trust’s stakeholders for their contributions and support during what has been a difficult period.  All those in our Trust’s family – whether parents, staff or members of our wider school community – want us to continue to provide a high-quality education so that our students aspire to excellence and achieve their full potential, both in their academic studies and personal development.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"did national trust end sorry state","story":"In the heritage world, David has just beaten Goliath. This week, Tim Parker, chairman of the National Trust, resigned after seven years in the role – and just 24 hours after a rebel group of members launched a bid to depose him at the annual general meeting.Restore Trust – of which I am a member – was only founded last month. It already has 10,000 supporters and a fighting fund of £50,000. It was founded to restore the trust to its original aims – to concentrate on conservation, an aesthetic experience, a sense of place, a feeling of welcome and an apolitical ethos. It has claimed a major scalp in the shape of Tim Parker.“This is the first step in a very important process,” a Restore Trust spokesman told me, “returning the trust to its true purpose, to care for the nation’s heritage – you can’t do that if you’re denouncing it. It’s vital it now has a chairman who cares about Britain’s heritage and can rebuild trust in the organisation.”It’s also a victory for grassroots members and volunteers over the National Trust management. During the past four years, the trust has become disastrously politicised. That – and the trust’s catastrophic dumbing-down – has been snowballing for 20 years.This decline has been at the hands of the trust’s management. The members and volunteers have only ever wanted what the trust was founded to do: preserve buildings of national interest, along with their furniture and pictures, and preserve beautiful landscapes. It’s the management that’s turned political.Last September, the trust published a report into the links between its properties – including Chartwell, the home of Winston Churchill – and Britain’s past colonial and slavery connections. The report was sloppy and littered with errors, like so much of the trust’s literature in recent years.Parker’s tenure as chairman since 2014 has only intensified the politicisation. At last year’s annual meeting, he said the trust had “not become a political organisation that has been taken over by a bunch of woke folk”. Yet in recent years, the trust has become increasingly political in its focus.There’s nothing wrong in the trust researching historical slavery links with its houses. But, as well as publishing its self-lacerating 2020 study, snappily entitled ‘Interim Report on the Connections between Colonialism and Properties now in the Care of the National Trust, Including Links with Historic Slavery’, in recent years it has launched a series of political initiatives slanted at attacking historical attitudes – and the owners of its houses – for not following modern progressive opinions.Any idea of praising the trust’s extraordinary contribution to British architectural, artistic and intellectual history has been eclipsed by this obsession with attacking “old-fashioned” attitudes.In 2018, the trust explored women’s history and suffrage via the anniversary of women gaining the vote in 1918. Of course, women getting the vote was a marvellous thing, but it is the trust’s job to look after houses and landscapes – not to celebrate political anniversaries.In 2017, as part of the trust’s ‘Prejudice and Pride’ season, it outed as gay Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer (1906-69), the kind man who’d given Felbrigg Hall to the trust. It also tried and failed to stop volunteers who refused to wear rainbow-coloured lanyards from working with the public.That year, in 2017, I went to the National Trust’s AGM in Swindon. Many of the members were up in arms. They had trekked hundreds of miles to the meeting on a cold, windy day – and their complaints were comprehensively ignored.One member, Stephen Green from Carmarthen, was outraged about what happened at Felbrigg. He asked the chairman if he would stop the trust being a political campaigning organisation that represented the “few who live and breathe political correctness”.Parker was the master of the non-apology apology: half-saying sorry, and then quickly snatching it away. He admitted that, with the benefit of hindsight, the Felbrigg incident had been a “small misjudgement”. But then he went on to say he was surprised and bemused by the hoohah.At the AGM, Patrick Streeter, a National Trust member from Essex, asked for an apology over the Felbrigg saga. Parker apologised “for any offence caused” – another classic non-apology apology.The trust also denies the catastrophic dumbing-down of its properties. Parker said: “We are not engaged in some social engineering experiment to thin out the intellectual content of our house presentation.”But the thinning-out of intellectual content at trust properties is undeniable. Last year, the trust set out its proposals for ‘Curation and Experience’, as part of its ‘Reset’ programme. It planned to get rid of all the lead curators in the regions and many junior curators. That meant losing talented scholars in architecture, archaeology, historic gardens, paintings and artefacts.Also last year, in a report called ‘Towards a 10-year vision for places and experiences, version 2.1’, Tony Berry, the trust’s Director of Visitor Experience, said he wanted to “dial down” the trust’s role as a big cultural institution and move away from looking after English country houses. The trust planned to put its collections in storage and hold fewer exhibitions at its properties to prioritise its role as the “gateway to the outdoors”. The 10-year strategy also attacked the “outdated mansion experience”.In 2017, I gave the Charles Douglas-Home Memorial Lecture, which I entitled “Betrayal of Trust: How the National Trust is losing its way”. I spent months touring trust houses and was staggered by the intellectual collapse of an organisation I’d revered since childhood.The trust’s house guides were littered with spelling mistakes. At Hughenden Manor, the Buckinghamshire house of Victorian prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, the trust’s official literature described his climb into “high soceity”. Isaac D’Israeli, Disraeli’s father, was called “Isaace” closely was spelt “closey”.It’s not just the lack of attention to detail baby language was everywhere at trust properties. At Osterley Park, the elegant Adam house on the fringes of west London, the servants’ quarters were decorated with a sign saying: “It was the scullery maid’s job to empty and clean the chamber pots every morning. A very smelly job.” A tree stump at Hughenden had a sign next to it, reading: “Please do not climb on me.”The trust has been dumbing down for 20 years, ever since Dame Fiona Reynolds, a senior civil servant, became its director general.Dame Helen Ghosh, Reynolds’s successor as director general, accelerated the dumbing-down. She even removed furniture from the fine Regency library at Ickworth House, Suffolk, temporarily replacing it with beanbags. There was “so much stuff” in trust houses, she said, that it put people off. Exhibits needed to be “simplified”.The trust is an astonishingly successful organisation, with just under six million members. And yet its management is tortured by paroxysms of self-hating agony because those six million people are largely white, middle-class and middle-aged.“Accessibility” is the trust’s great false god. Of course, anyone can go to any trust property they want. And yet the trust is deeply depressed when the visitor profile is dominated by the pale and stale. And so they’ve become obsessed with changing that profile.A former chairman, Sir Simon Jenkins, was once told by a trust employee that it “feared” many of its new members were “over 50”. As Jenkins said: “In 15 years, half the population would be over 50 and a third over 60. It was good news.”Most charities, anywhere in the world, would be delighted with six million members, of any age or skin colour. Only the National Trust is mad – and rude – enough to take against the background of its members: the people who pay for the trust, volunteer for it and love it.And, as a now-dead former senior employee of the trust once told me: “What you must understand is that a lot of senior people at the trust actually don’t like old buildings.”This whole process – the politicisation and the sad dumbing-down – need never have taken place. English Heritage has maintained its properties with no dumbing down and none of its members has complained.Here’s hoping the new National Trust chairman will end the politics and the hatred of the past and concentrate on the job – looking after its artistic, architectural and landscape treasures.Harry Mount is author of How England Made the English. To order your copy for £8.99, call 0844 851 1514 or visit the  BookshopMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"extinct giant tortoise found galapagos","story":"A giant tortoise found on the Galapagos Islands is from a species last seen more than a century ago, scientists have confirmed.An elderly female tortoise discovered during a 2019 expedition has been identified as a chelonoidis phantasticus, also known as fernandina giant tortoise.Until now the only inidual was collected in 1906 by researchers from the California Academy of Sciences, which was carrying out a survey of the island\u0027s flora and fauna.They brought a sample back to the university, allowing Yale University scientists to make a comparison with the female 113 years later.The female is currently at a breeding centre in Santa Cruz Island, California, but scientists have found prints and droppings on Fernandina Island and think there are more living in the wild, though there have been no other confirmed sightings.Fernandina Island, the third-largest in the Galapagos archipelago, is the site of an active volcano that erupts frequently, leading to fears for the tortoise\u0027s survival.Ecuador\u0027s environment minister celebrated the discovery, writing in a tweet: It was believed extinct more than 100 years ago! Hope is alive.Danny Rueda, director of the Galapagos National Park, said that a future expedition would look for more iniduals. This discovery undoubtedly renews our hope for the recovery of this species, he said.The Galapagos Islands, which are about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, have a high number of species not found anywhere else in the world.Charles Darwin developed his theory of evolution after visiting the archipelago on board HMS Beagle in 1835.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hypnotises alexander lukashenko rose become europes last dictator","story":"“He has a magnetic presence. He hypnotises you,” said the former official, who resigned last year shortly after the anti-government protests broke out.Mr Lukashenko was born to a single mother in the Vitebsk region of what was then the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954.And he has repeatedly demonstrated that he has no problem jailing, torturing, and exiling those he deems a threat.He kept those close to him off balance with frequent reshuffles, promotions and demotions designed to prevent an elite gathering enough power to challenge him.And he successfully played off Vladimir Putin\u0027s need to keep Belarus close to Russia against the EU\u0027s hopes of democratising it.“Charming might be going too far, he could be pleasant and mild when he wishes too, said Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow at the international institute for strategic studies and former UK diplomat who served as UK ambassador to Minsk between 2007 and 2009.But below the surface there is always the sense of someone who is constantly assessing their interlocutors with this almost animal sense - maybe animal scent, in fact - of what power is, and where it lies. Which is quite disconcerting.”The combination of repression, Soviet nostalgia, and cunning was a winning combination for several years.Nexta, the independent media outlet, claimed in a recent documentary that he has massively enriched himself during his time in office, making use of nearly two dozen official residences, two private jets and luxury cars which are not owned in his name. The  was unable to independently verify the claims.He also developed a dictator\u0027s eccentricities, the most visible being his grooming of his third and youngest son Nikolai as his successor.  Close observers say the pair are inseparable, and the doting on his son appears genuine - a foil to the ruthlessness that characterises his dealings with others.Mr Lukashensko\u0027s incredible self confidence even seems to have survived the clear collapse of his popularity. The transparent rigging of last August’s presidential election his mishandling of the Covid epidemic, which has seen him mock both science and victims and a years long economic malaise has seen whatever legitimacy he used to enjoy among the public melt away.Faced with enormous protests against his rule, he refused to back down -  at one point telling heckling factory workers that he would only leave office if they killed him.Instead, he sought to crush the opposition with incredible violence.

He was always very firm that it should remain non-political, and keen for it to become as businesslike as possible.The Trust said Mr Parker had already served two three-year terms and agreed to a third exceptional term to oversee the charity through the Covid crisis.It began attracting criticism during the regime of its previous director-general, Dame Helen Ghosh, who ran it from 2012 until 2018.Her successor, Hilary McGrady, courted controversy when overseeing the publication of a 115-page report which blacklisted 93 of its estates over their links to slavery, including Sir Winston Churchill\u0027s home at Chartwell in Kent.Critics allege that influential senior managers and advisers have pushed a more politicised agenda and want a new chairman to try to curb any future projects that might be seen to be straying outside the National Trust\u0027s traditional remit to preserve historic properties and countryside and keep them open to the public.It is understood that the controversial report into colonial connections at Trust properties was commissioned by the charity\u0027s influential Curation and Experience Department under the management of John Orna-Ornstein, a museum specialist who was appointed in 2017.The original project was launched in 2018 and the final report published last year, sparking an outcry.In August 2020, Mr Orna-Ornstein said the Black Lives Matter movement had made the Trust realise that we need to go much faster in addressing colonialism and slavery. Sources suggested Mr Parker had little direct involvement and remained remote from this area of work. Conservative MPs have called for the next chairman to be elected by the Trust\u0027s members and said the successful candidate needed to keep its management under a stricter watch.Sir John Hayes, the chairman of the Common Sense Group of around 60 Tory MPs, said the next chairman should overhaul the board to remove any metropolitan glitterati.The next chairman has got to recognise that the Trust has lost its way and needs to return to the principles upon which it was founded, he added. The maintenance and promotion of our heritage isn\u0027t about the faddish preoccupation with all kinds of trendy, right-on causes and campaigns.Andrew Murrison MP, a former minister, said he was worried the new appointment would be stitched up by the other board members.Mr Murrison said the successful candidate had to be put forward to an approval vote at the AGM on Oct 30 in the same way that Parliament is allowed a confirmation hearing for senior public appointments, adding: Most people would be surprised that some input from the membership was not in place already in choosing the chairman.We need a high-profile chairman who can hold his or her own, who has a proven track record, will listen to the members and also be sympathetic to the extremely dedicated workforce.”Restore Trust, a group of disaffected members who were planning to table a motion calling on Mr Parker to resign, said it wanted the recruitment process to be as open as possible. A source said: “We want an open process so we can see the shortlist.”A National Trust spokesman said the appointment would be made by the National Trust Council, which is made up of 36 members who have a range of expertise in everything from education and agriculture to nature and the built environment.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trusted instagram forex trader watched life savings disappear","story":"So where does the blame lie?

Recovery times deteriorated with age.Using artificial intelligence they were able to measure the lessening resilience of the body, and extrapolate the changes over time to the point where it would cease to have any resilience.Heather Whitson, director of the Duke University Center for the Study of Aging, who was not involved in the study, told Scientific American: They are asking the question of \u0027What’s the longest life that could be lived by a human complex system if everything else went really well, and it’s in a stress-free environment?’In doing so the study established a pace of ageing which could be used to predict the outer limit of what was possible.Read more: Human ageing process biologically reversed in world firstThe study, published in Nature Communications, was carried out by Singapore-based company Gero, in collaboration with the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York.Findings from the blood samples and step counts painted exactly the same future, the study found.It said ageing manifested itself as a progressive functional decline and resilience would be ultimately lost at the age in the range of 120–150 years, thus indicating the absolute limit of human life.The report said: We therefore argue that the loss of resilience cannot be avoided even in the most successfully ageing iniduals.Currently, the oldest human being ever recorded was Jeanne Calment, a French woman who died in 1997 at the age of 122.That was 28 years short of what the study predicted as the absolute limit for humans.Average global life expectancy is currently 73. In 1950 it was 47.The steady increase has contributed to a belief among some that it can be pushed ever higher through health and fitness initiatives.Numerous wealthy iniduals and companies have begun looking at ways to increase life. Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire entrepreneur, has funded anti-ageing research and declared himself against death.Google has also backed a company aiming to extend longevity.The Gero study said: Healthy human subjects turned out to be very resilient.But it added: If the trend holds at later ages the extrapolation shows a complete loss of human body resilience, that is the ability to recover, at some age around 120-150-years-old.The reduced resilience was observed even in iniduals not suffering from major chronic diseases.Dr Andrei Gudkov, a co-author of the study, said: It explains why even the most effective prevention and treatment of age-related diseases could only improve the average, but not the maximal, life unless true anti-ageing therapies have been developed.The scientists suggested it was possible the absolute limit could be increased in the future. Gero co-founder Dr Peter Fedichev said: Measuring something is the first step before producing an intervention.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"primates shake hands ape accents just like people","story":"For more than 150 years, since Darwin’s The Descent of Man, humans have been aware that we evolved from an ape-like ancestor, and we now know our earliest known relative lived around eight million years ago.But go further back, and we also share a more distant ancestor with monkeys who roamed Earth around 25 million years ago.And two new pieces of research reveal that despite millions of years of evolution, we still possess many of the same social behaviours as other primates. For example, a person in foreign territory surrounded by potentially violent natives will try and do everything they can to blend in, avoid drawing attention to themselves, and therefore stave off any confrontation. A new study, published in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, found red-handed tamarins, a black monkey the size of a domestic cat with golen-coloured fur on its paws, take the same approach. These monkeys are native to South America and live on an omnivorous diet of spiders, insects, fruits and tree gums. But their ideal habitat and food is the same as another species of tamarin, the pied tamarin. Unlike their brightly-fingered cousins, pied tamarins are critically endangered and have one of the smallest ranges of any primate in the world, much of it around the city of Manaus.As a result, they are fiercely protective of their land and the natural goods it yields.A study run by Anglia Ruskin University followed this tetchy dynamic and found red-handed tamarins change the sound of their voice when encroaching on pied land to sound like pieds and avoid alerting the protective locals to their presence. Red-handed tamarins use their much wider vocal range to bellow out the long calls characteristic of the pied tamarins.This phenomenon is the opposite of what normally happens, where two species often continuously erge and become more different.  Co-author Dr Jacob Dunn, associate professor in Evolutionary Biology at ARU, said: Our study is the first to show asymmetric call convergence in primates, with one species\u0027 call becoming the \u0027lingua franca\u0027 in shared territories.Because these tamarin species rely on similar resources, changing their \u0027accents\u0027 in this way is likely to help these tiny primates identify one another more easily in dense forest and potentially avoid conflict.While monkeys and humans share the desire to blend in and avoid conflict, chimps and people also share a very specific trait — different groups have their own handshake.For example, one group might opt for a fist bump with a bunch of friends, others prefer a traditional grab-and-shake, some like the humble high five, and in some cultures a clasping of the forearms is the norm. A 12-year study run by the University of Antwerp found chimpanzees also develop unique handshake-like gestures specific to their social group.Dr Edwin van Leeuwen, an expert in animal behaviour, studied dozens of chimpanzees sheltered at Zambia\u0027s Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust.Dr van Leeuwen saw that in different two groups, the apes often performed a handclasping ritual when grooming.The gesture involves each of the participants simultaneously (extending) an arm overhead and the other (clasping) the other\u0027s wrist or hand or both clasping each other\u0027s hand, according to the study, published in the journal Royal Society Biology Letters.In the research, Dr van Leeuwen notes that in one group, palm-to-palm grasping is very common in one group but not the other. He also found that female chimps were far more likely than males to grasp palms, while males were more likely to grasp wrists.The fact that they have developed different styles in different groups reflects that they learn the style socially within their groups, Dr van Leeuwen told AFP.He believes the chimps may have learned to perform the grasps as a ritual, reminiscent of secret handshakes performed by humans.The handclasp fits into the whole social interaction that two iniduals engage in sometimes, making it a special connection within an already intimate grooming bout, he said.He said the behaviour could not be explained by genetic or environmental factors since the  two groups were essentially identical - yet they each developed different grasping methods. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thursday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Adopting the role of the judge-penitent -

The Health Secretary was branded a liar who should have been sacked  to  times in an explosive Commons hearing. And most gravely, he was accused of misleading the PM about the situation in care homes before tens of thousands died. Mr Hancock will come out fighting today, with a .am debate in the Commons and a pm press conference. He has already issued a statement through his team, failing to refute any specic allegation but just saying: “We absolutely reject Mr. Cummingsapos claims about the Health Secretary. “At all times throughout this pandemic [Hancock] and everyone in DHSC has worked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives.” His supporters will write off Dominic Cummings ’ claims as the ravings of an embittered controversialist who lost his job - and point out he carefully avoided criticising potential leadership contenders Rishi Sunak and Michael Gove.But regardless of whether Cummings is a reliable witness, his statements do raise important questions for the Health Secretary. No doubt Mr Hancock will today make a broad-brush dismissal or denial of Cummings’ claims. Buthe doesn’t engage in the detail of these questions, you might need to raise an eyebrow or two. How long did you know new care home residents weren’t being routinely tested Covid was allowed to flow into care homes during a crucial month last year in which routine testing halted due to lack of capacity. Residents, new arrivals and staff with symptoms were not routinely tested from mid-March, when community testing ended, to April . Until April , not even new arrivals from hospitals were being routinely tested. More than a quarter of England’s Covid deaths have been in care homes, including many thousands in the first wave. Mr Hancock would later claim: “Right from the start we’ve tried to throw a protective ring around our care homes.” But how true was that - and when did he realise the virus was being seeded into the care system  Yesterday Mr Cummings revealed he and the PM - who were steamrollered by Covid in that crucial month - didn’t know for weeks that people were leaving hospital without being routinely tested.The ex-aide said: “He [ Boris Johnson ] came back after being ill - what on earth has happened with all these people in care homes  “Hancock told us in the Cabinet room that people were going to be tested in care homes. What the hell happened ” He added: “It was only in April after the Prime Minister and I had both ourselves been ill that we realised that what we were told never did happen, or only happened very partially and sporadically”. He went on: “The government rhetoric was ‘we put a shield around care homes, blah blah blah’ - that was complete nonsense. “Quite the opposite of putting a shield round them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.”Was it true that everyone got the treatment they needed Mr Cummings said: “In the summer he said everyone who needed treatment got the treatment they required. “He knew that was a lie because he’d been briefed by the Chief Scientic Advisor and the Chief Medical Officer himself about the first peak. “And we were told explicitly people did not get the treatment they deserved. Many people were left to die in horric circumstances.” Mr Cummings did not point to exactly where Mr Hancock made the comments and we were unable to find them last night. But it raises questions about whether he nished the truth when claiming the NHS was never “overwhelmed” by Covid. Did you ‘criminally’ interfere with Test and Trace to meet your own target Mr Cummings accused the Health Secretary of criminal, disgraceful interference with the Test and Trace scheme to meet his ”stupid testing target of , per day last year. Mr Cummings told MPs: In my opinion, disastrously, [Matt Hancock] had made - while the PM was on his near deathbed - this pledge to do , [tests a day] by the end of April. This was an incredibly stupid thing to do because we already that goal internally.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeDominic Cummings has given a searing assessment of incompetence, failure and arrogance at the top of government as the Covid- pandemic killed thousands of people “who didn’t need to die”.In a seven-hour marathon appearance at a joint Committee of MPs, Boris Johnson ’s former top aide said his old boss had ‘ignored advice’ and was late to introduce both the first and second lockdowns.Mr Cummings claimed the PM was consistently anti-lockdown, ignored scientic advice and failed to take Covid seriously - even ranting last summer that he should never have done Lockdown .MPs heard that No  was warned the UK was “absolutely f****d” and coronavirus would “kill thousands of people” as Mr Johnson dragged his feet over bringing in the first lockdown last year - something Cummings said he “bitterly” regrets.He painted a picture of a chaotic and dysal Downing Street in denial over the scale of the disaster ahead.  Mr Cummings also turned his guns on Carrie Symonds, suggesting she had pursued “completely unethical and clearly illegal” attempts to pack No  with her own friends. But his most vicious broadsides were reserved for Health Secretary Matt Hancock, whom he branded “disgraceful” - and potentially “criminal.” Mr Cummings said there were around  reasons why Mr Hancock should have been thrown out of the Cabinet - including, he claimed, lying both in meetings and publicly.But he had no such venom for Brexiteer allies Dominic Raab, Michael Gove - and particularly Rishi Sunak, whom he described as “competent and extremely able”.With Mr Sunak long touted as a future leader, and Mr Cummings having a string of personal scores to settle, that will raise questions over the motivation behind his claims today. Questions also remain over Mr Cummings reliability, after he introduced yet another explanation of his trip to Durham at the height of the first lockdown, and claimed the borders should have been shut since January despite doing little work on Covid by then. That said, his evidence raises serious questions for Boris Johnson - and is almost impossible to wade through. So to break things into bite-sized chunks, here are the all most explosive moments in his testimony to ParliamentTens of thousands of Brits died needlessly due to government failureIn what’s ultimately his most damning admission, the ex-adviser said bluntly: Tens of thousands of people died, who didnapost need to die. Mr Cummings claimed the PM was consistently anti-lockdown, ignored scientic advice and failed to take Covid seriously. The former top aide began his evidence with a mea culpa: “The truth is senior ministers, officials and advisers like me fell short of standards the public has a right to expect. “When the public needed us most, we failed. I’d like to say to all the families how sorry I am for the mistakes we made”. PM had no idea for weeks that Covid was flowing into care homesMr Cummings revealed Boris Johnson had no idea for weeks that people leaving hospital into care weren’t being routinely tested in late March. That led to the virus being seeded into care homes and tens of thousands of residents dying. Blaming the Health Secretary, he told MPs: “[Matt] Hancock told us in the Cabinet room that people were going to be tested in care homes. What the hell happened ” He added: “It was only in April after the Prime Minister and I had both ourselves been ill that we realised that what we were told never did happen, or only happened very partially and sporadically”. He went on: “The government rhetoric was ‘we put a shield around care homes, blah blah blah’ - that was complete nonsense. “Quite the opposite of putting a shield round them, we sent people with Covid back to the care homes.”  A top official admitted ‘we’re f*****, we’re going to kill thousands’ -  days before lockdownA top No official warned “we’re absolutely f****d” as the Covid response descended into chaos, he claimed - but it still took another  days to lock down. Until the second week of March the consensus in No was that there was no point locking down because it would only delay the inevitable peak. But he claimed former Deputy Cabinet Secretary Helen Macnamara voiced early doubts. She allegedly said another top official, Mark Sweeney, had told her: “I’ve been told for years there is a whole plan for this. There is no plan. We’re in huge trouble.” Mr Cummings said Ms Macnamara told him on March : “I think we are absolutely f****d. I think this country is heading for a disaster, I think we are going to kill thousands of people.” Boris Johnson thought it was all just a ‘scare story’Mr Cummings argued it would not have been helpful for his boss to attend emergency COBRA meetings in February - five of which he missed - because he would have had flippant responses to the crisis. “The basic thought was that in February the Prime Minister regarded this as just a scare story,” said Mr Cummings. “He described it as the new swine flu.”He could’ve boasted he would be injected with Covid on TVMr Cummings insisted he “definitely” told Mr Johnson the coronavirus was not just a scare story. But in a shocking claim, he told MPs: “The view of ious officials inside No waswe have the Prime Minister chairing COBRA meetings and he just tells everyone ‘it’s swine flu, don’t worry about it, I’m going to get Chris Whitty to inject me live on TV with coronavirus so everyone realises it’s nothing to be frightened of’, that would not help actually serious planning.” Boris Johnson was told to encourage ‘chicken pox parties’ for herd immunityMr Cummings made an equally explosive allegation about then-Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill. On March , he said, “the Cabinet Secretary said ‘Prime Minister, you should go on TV tomorrow ad explain to people the herd immunity and that it’s like the old chicken pox parties - we need people to get this disease because that’s how we get herd immunity by September’. “And I said Mark you’ve got to stop using this chicken pox analogy it’s not right, and he said ‘why’. “And [data scientist] Ben Warner said ‘because chicken pox isn’t spreading exponentially and killing hundreds of thousands of people.’” Mr Cummings added: “He was saying what the official advice to him from the Department of Health was.” That day, Chief Scientist Patrick Vallance told the nation suppressing the virus completely was not “desirable” because some immunity was needed. And Boris Johnson told the nation “many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.” The nation’s top civil servant wanted Matt Hancock sacked for ‘lies’Matt Hancock should have been fired for at least - things during the Covid crisis, Mr Cummings told MPs. In an extraordinary attack, he accused the Health Secretary of lying to everybody on multiple occasions - including in the Cabinet room. He said he and Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, had both personally urged the Prime Minister to sack Mr Hancock after he “performed far, far disastrously below the standards the country has a right to expect”. He said the “lies” included claiming everyone had got the treatment they needed in the first wave, despite being “explicitly told” that was untrue and “many people were left to die in horric circumstances”. They also included telling Cabinet “everything is fine on PPE, we’ve got it all covered”, before then blaming blockages on the Chancellor and NHS chief Simon Stevens. Mr Cummings said he asked Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill to investigate Mr Hancock’s blame claims, but “the Cabinet Secretary came back to me and said ‘it’s completely untrue, I have lost confidence in the Secretary of State’s honesty in these meetings.’”  No today insisted Boris Johnson has full confidence in his Health Secretary but refused to comment on specic claims. Mr Hancockaposs team said they reject Mr Cummingsapos claims, but didnapost specy which ones exactly. A spokesman for Mr Hancock said: “We absolutely reject Mr. Cummingsapos claims about the Health Secretary. “The Health Secretary will continue to work closely with the Prime Minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by iants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic.” No were distracted because Donald Trump wanted Britain to bomb IraqMr Cummings said March  was the most “surreal” day of his time in government. Just as he was waking up to the danger of No’s “delay the peak” plan, he claimed, “suddenly the national security people came in and said Trump wants us to join a bombing campaign in the Middle East tonight. “And we need to start having meetings about that through the day with COBRA as well. “So everything to do with COBRA that day on Covid was completely disrupted.” He added: “Fortunately, thank God, the attorney general persuaded the PM not to go along with the whole bombing campaign.”Carrie Symonds demanded No staff ert their time to concentrate on her dogMr Cummings went on: “And then to add, it sounds so surreal it couldn’t possibly be true, that day the Times had run a huge story about the Prime Minister and his girlfriend and their dog. “And the Prime Minister’s girlfriend was going completely crackers about this story.and demanding that the press office deal with that. “So we had this sort of completely insane situation in which part of the building was saying are we going to bomb Iraq, part of the building was arguing about whether or not we’re going to do quarantine or not, the Prime Minister has his girlfriend going crackers about something completely trivial, and you have all these meetings going on through the course of the th.”  He accused Carrie Symonds of ‘illegal’ actsMr Cummings, who eventually quit in November, said: ”My resignation was definitely connected to the fact that the Prime Ministeraposs girlfriend was trying to change a whole bunch of dferent appointments in No and appoint her friends to particular jobs. In particular she was trying to overturn the outcome of an official process about hiring a particular job in a way which was not only completely unethical but was also clearly illegal. I thought the whole process about how the Prime Minister was behaving at that point was appalling and all of that was definitely part of why I went.  He branded the PM ‘unfit for the job’Mr Cummings said the main reason was because his relationship with Boris Johnson was already finished by October. He said he blamed the PM for the second wave thanks to his flat refusal to lock down for a second time in September. He told MPs: Fundamentally I regarded him as unfit for the job. “I was trying to create a structure around him to try and stop what I thought were extremely bad decisions, and push other things through against his wishes.Cummings raised alarm over PM’s strategy -  days before lockdownMr Cummings said his “mounting panic” began on March  last year when he sent a text to a group including the PM. The next morning, at .am, he said he texted Mr Johnson: “We’ve got big problems coming. “The Cabinet Office is terryingly s***, no plans, totally behind the pace. “We must announce today not next week -you feel ill with cold or flu, stay home… We are looking at ,-, deaths between optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.”  He said he then sat down with his favoured experts at pm on March , when they “hit the total panic button” and told him “we’re heading for total and utter catastrophe, we need to have Plan B.” Yet he said he only then told Mr Johnson on March  - nine days before lockdown - “you are going to have to lock down”. He admitted this three-day gap was not good enough. “It was a huge failing of mine and I bitterly regret that I didn’t hit the emergency panic button earlier than I did,” he told MPs.There was simply no plan for lockdownMr Cummings said he told the PM on March : “There is no lockdown plan. It doesn’t exist. SAGE haven’t modelled it. [The Health Department] don’t have a plan. We are going to have to figure out and hack together a lockdown plan.” He said by March , when there was “pushback” about ordering people with coughs to stay at home, he believed “the system is basically delaying announcing all of these things because there’s not a proper plan in place.” Officials also dodged locking down because they thought the public wouldn’t accept it. But that was clearly “”, and he said he realised that when family members were texting pleading for information.Key people were off skiing when coronavirus took hold“The government itself and No was not operating on a war footing in February on this in any way, shape or form,” he said. “Lots of key people were literally skiing in the middle of February. It wasn’t until the last week of February that there was any sense of urgency, I would say.” Mr Cummings said claims about extensive preparations for a pandemic were ”basically completely hollow” and “we didn’t figure this out until the back end of February”.Boris Johnson’s refusal to lock down in September was a personal crusadeDominic Cummings rehearsed the well-known arguments that Boris Johnson refused pleas to lock down for a second time in September, only doing it from November .“He wasn’t taking any advice. He was making the decisions himself,” he said. “The Cabinet wasn’t involved...there wasn’t any formal Cabinet meeting to discuss it. Orthere was, it was a purely Potemkin exercise.” The PM had decided he was protecting the economy, and Mr Cummings said “we could not persuade him thatyou basically took the view of ‘let it rip’”, it would lead to an economic and health “disaster.” Mr Johnson later used the phrase “let it rip” as a catchphrase to showcase the kind of approach he would not take.The government was turning down ventilators in late March because prices were jacked upMr Cummings told MPs: “I think it was the day the PM tested positive… the th [of March] I think. “In that meeting we were told at the Cabinet table by officials that the Department of Health had been turning down ventilators because the price had been marked up. “It completely beggars belief that that sort of thing was happening.”No staff drew up a whiteboard asking who they couldn’t ‘save’Mr Cummings spent the days in the run-up to his appearance dripping information on his Twitter feed - including a photo of a whiteboard last March.He said the scribblings were the first sketch of a Plan B, PM study. One noticeable line at the bottom has caused a stir - where it said aposwho do we not save apos. aposNotapos has been underlined. Explaining the remark, Mr Cummings said “we were already partly over the clf” and it reflected the reality of the unfolding pandemic.  Cummings accused Hancock of ‘criminal behaviour’ over his ‘stupid target’Mr Cummings accused the Health Secretary of criminal, disgraceful interference with the Test and Trace scheme to meet a stupid testing target of , per day. Mr Cummings told MPs: In my opinion, disastrously, [Matt Hancock] had made - while the PM was on his near deathbed - this pledge to do , [tests a day] by the end of April. This was an incredibly stupid thing to do because we already that goal internally. When he ed to work after having Covid himself, Mr Cummings said he started receiving calls from people who said: Hancock is interfering with the building of the Test and Trace system because heaposs telling everybody what to do to maximise his chances of hitting his stupid target by the end of the month. He added: In my opinion he shouldaposve been fired for that thing alone. That itself meant the whole of April was hugely disrupted by dferent parts of Whitehall fundamentally trying to operate in dferent ways completely because Hancock wanted to be able to go on TV and say aposlook at me and my k targetapos. It was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm.Cummings thought about quitting and going on TV to accuse PM of killing thousands The ex-aide said he should have resigned much earlier, and “I thought about it in March. “If we hadn’t successfully bounced things in March  I had talked to ious people during that week about saying to him that I will resign and hold a press conference and say the government’s going to kill hundreds of thousands of people. “I had similar conversations with people in September.” In the end, though, he quit in what critics say is a childish power struggle over who pulled the strings at No.‘Thousands’ of people would do a better job than ‘donkey’ Prime MinisterMr Cummings said it was “crackers” that either he or Boris Johnson had their jobs, “thousands” of Brits could do it better, and hero nurses were “lions led by donkeys”.He added: “There’s a very profound question about the nature of our political system that means we got at the last election a choice between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson.“I think any system which ends up giving a choice between two people like that to lead is obviously a system that’s gone extremely badly wrong.” He added: “In any sensible rational government it is completely crazy that I should have been in such a senior position in my personal opinion. “I’m not smart. I’ve not built great things in the world. It’s completely crackers that someone like me should have been in there, just as it’s crackers that Boris was in there and the choice at the last election was Jeremy Corbyn.” “The problem in this crisis was very much lions led by donkeys over and over again.”  The PM DID say ‘let the bodies pile high’Boris Johnson DID make infamous comments about ‘bodies piling high’, Dominic Cummings declared. He said he heard the Prime Minister make the remarks, originally reported as “no more f*****g lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands”, in the PM’s study shortly after his decision to implement a second lockdown on  October . That raises serious questions over Boris Johnsonaposs honesty. The PM has denied on the record and to Parliament that he made the remarks, saying the claims were “total, total rubbish”. There was a version of it in the Sunday Times, which was not accurate. But the version that the BBC reported was accurate, Mr Cummings said. I heard that in the Prime Ministeraposs study. That was not in September though, that was immediately after he finally made the decision to do the lockdown on October .Boris Johnson wanted to be like the mayor in Jaws - with no border controlsMr Cummings said he had a fractious meeting with the PM in July  when he flat refused to introduce border controls to stop a second wave. He said: He added: “He had the Dailywith their stupid campaign on the whole subject, he had Tory MPs going crackers about it at the same time. “And essentially at that point he was in ‘we should never have done lockdown, I should have been the mayor of Jaws [who kept the beaches open], now I’m going to be, open everything up, get on with it’. “And me and others just could not win that argument.  “We never won the argument - as of today. Look at the whole thing about iants. We still don’t have a proper border policy.” No said it would “obviously refute” that the border policy was too weak now, saying: “We have some of the toughest border measures in the world and we have taken action whenever necessary to keep the public safe.Boris Johnson ranted that the first lockdown should never have happenedHe also explosively claimed the PM ranted “we should never have done lockdown ” and any border control would ruin the travel industry. Mr Cummings went on: “To which of course some of us said, there’s not going to be a tourism industry in the Autumnwe have a second wave.’ The whole logic is completely wrong. “There was just no fundamentally good logic to not shutting the borders in January in my opinion and there was never any logic to it after April.”Boris Johnson is a ’disaster zone’ who changes his mind constantly like a ‘shopping trolley’In a blistering personal attack, he said Mr Johnson “made some terrible decisions and got things wrong and then constantly U-turned on everything” Mr Cummings told MPs: “The reason for all these problems was bad policy, bad decisions, bad planning, bad operational capability. “It doesn’t matteryou’ve got great people doing communicationsthe Prime Minister changes his mind  times a day and then calls up the media and contradicts his own policy day after day. “You’re going to have a communications disaster zone.” He added: “You cannot keep changing your mind every time thewrites an editorial on the subject… nobody could find a way around the problem of the PM like a shopping trolley smashing from one side of the island to the other.” The PM ‘laughed’ and said chaos is good because it makes him look more powerfulIn his summer  conversation with the PM, Mr Cummings claimed he said: “This whole system is chaos, this building is chaos, You are more frightened of me having the power to stop the chaos than you are afraid of the chaos.” He told MPs: “The PM laughed and said ‘you’re right, I am more frightened of you having the power to stop the chaos than I am of the chaos. ‘Chaos isn’t that bad. Chaos means everyone has to look to me to see who’s in charge.’”‘Stupid’ Boris Johnson personally decided to ‘pick a fight’ with Marcus RashfordThe “stupid” PM personally decided to defy footballer Marcus Rashford’s plea for free school meals over half term, against aides’ advice, he said. Mr Cummings told MPs: “The Director of Communications said to the PM twice ‘do not pick a fight with Rashford, obviously we should do this instead’. “The PM decided to pick a fight and then surrendered twice. “After that everyone says ‘your communications are stupid’ - what’s stupid is picking a fight with Rashford over school meals and what should have happened is just getting the school meals policy right.” People in government thought Covid was over and done with last summerMr Cummings said: “From the summer fundamentally the view was ‘we’re past it now, Covid is history’ - which was a terrible, terrible mistake.” Yet curiously he avoided criticising Rishi Sunak, the architect of the ill-fated ‘Eat out to Help Out’ scheme.Cummings just couldn’t help referring to filmsAt one point he told MPs: “You know that Spiderman meme with both Spidermans pointing at each other  It’s like that, but with everybody.” At another he said: “This is like a scene from Independence Day with Jeff Goldblum saying the aliens are here and your whole plan is broken and you need a new plan.” Covid- Bereaved Families For Justice, set up in the wake of the pandemic, blasted Mr Cummings saying: That this information is being unveiled in a pantomime-style spat between Cummings and Johnson, littered with independence day, Jeff Goldblum and spiderman references, is utterly inappropriate and makes this even more appalling.”Boris Johnson slammed for ‘terrible’ decision to delay Covid inquiry Boris Johnson today angrily rejected Labour ’s demand to bring forward a Covid inquiry to this summer, saying: “No! As I’ve said before I’m not going to concentrate valuable official time on that now while we’re still battling a pandemic.”But Mr Cummings said: “I think the idea that a serious inquiry, a lessons learned, doesnapost start until next year is completely terrible. “The families... tens of thousands of people died who didnapost need to die. Thereaposs absolutely no excuse for delaying that. “Because a lot of the reasons for why that happened are still in place now. Look at the whole debate about iants and what not. This has to be honestly explained.” He added: “If Number  today wonapost tell the truth about the official [herd immunity] plan which they briefed the media about and explained on TV a year ago, what on earth  is going on in there now ”Cummings finally admits his lockdown trip undermined public trustDominic Cummings admitted the debacle over his March  lockdown road trip “undermined public confidence” in the government. The former aide “deeply apologised” for the way he presented his farcical press conference in the No rose garden. Mr Cummings said “that whole episode was definitely a major disaster for the government and for the Covid policy.” He added: “I know that my misjudgement caused huge trouble. I deeply apologise for it.”But he refuses to apologise for his -mile road trip last March However, Mr Cummings refused to apologise for his actions - instead revealing he “couldn’t tell the whole story” last year about why he drove  miles in a national lockdown to Durham. He told MPs he had already discussed moving his family out of their London home due to security threats, including a few days before he fell ill with Covid. Around March , he said, he said to his we: “We’ve been discussing it for months - we’ve got to get out of here on Friday”.  For that reason, he said, he decided to “stonewall” the Mirror’s story before U-turning and giving a press conference three days later in the No rose garden, due to demands from Boris Johnson. But he decided not to go into any detail about the security threats because he was still in government. He told MPs: “I ended up giving the whole rose garden thing where what I said was true, but we left out a crucial part of it all. The whole thing was a complete disaster. It undermined public confidence in the whole thing.”Cummings wanted a ‘dictator’ as Prime MinisterOne of the most revealing quotes about his personality, Mr Cummings said: “In a well-run entity what would have happened is, essentially in my opinion, you would have had a kind of dictator in charge of this. “If I’d been Prime Minister I would have said [data expert] Marc Warner is in charge of this whole thing. “He speaks with my authority. He has as close to kingly authority as the state has legally to do stuff, and pushing the barriers of legality.”And to sum it all up… Cummings was branded a ‘disingenuous little f*****’MP Paul Bristow quoted to Mr Cummings an anonymous No claim that heaposs a disingenuous little f*****”. He was actually distracted in mid-February by his ambitions to put Cummings acolytes in every post of power”, the MP suggested. Mr Cummings insisted most stories about his dealings with the civil service were “% nonsense”. But it’s true that large parts of the hearing were eaten up by Mr Cummings talking about his own self-importance and sense of right. One y argument was over whether he did or didn’t retrospectively edit his blog to insert a warning about Covid.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBoris JohnsonCabinetNHSCare homesCivil servantsPoliticsCoronavirusDominic Cummings"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock hold press conference","story":"NewsMatt Hancock to hold press conference after vicious attack from Dominic CummingsThe Health Secretary is set to lead a Covid press conference today - after Boris Johnsons former top aide branded him \"disgraceful” - and potentially “criminal”mirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video dominic-cummings-mounts-blistering-attack-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:MNfiVcq,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice Matt Hancock is to hold a press conference today, after coming under sustained attack from former colleague Dominic Cummings.The Health Secretary is due to lead a Covid briefing from Downing Street at pm, after Boris Johnsonaposs former top aide attacked his disastrous handling of the Covid- pandemic. He will also face a grilling from MPs in the Commons when he answers an urgent question tabled by Labouraposs Jonathan Ashworth.Mr Cummings said he had repeatedly called for Mr Hancock to be sacked over coronavirus failings and criminal, disgraceful behaviour on the testing target.And he claimed Whitehallaposs top official recommended to the Prime Minister that Mr Hancock should be sacked.Downing Street did not deny that the Prime Minister considered sacking Mr Hancock in April last year but insisted Boris Johnson has confidence in him now, as the Health Secretary disputed the allegations.  Mr Cummings said there were around  reasons why Mr Hancock should have been thrown out of the Cabinet - including, he claimed, lying both in meetings and publicly. Mr Hancock used chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance as shields to blame for his failures, Mr Cummings claimed. He said Mr Hancock performed disastrously below the standards expected and the cabinet secretary - the countryaposs top civil servant - recommended the Health Secretary should be sacked.Mr Cummings said that while Donald Trump was ordering the CIA to gazump rival countries on orders for personal protective equipment , the Department of Health and Social Carewas still trying to get orders from China by ship.I think the Secretary of State for Health shouldaposve been fired for at least ,  things, including lying to everybody on multiple occasions in meeting after meeting in the Cabinet room and publicly, Mr Cummings said. Thereaposs no doubt at all that many senior people performed far, far disastrously below the standards which the country has a right to expect. I think the Secretary of State for Health is certainly one of those people. I said repeatedly to the Prime Minister that he should be fired, so did the cabinet secretary, so did many other senior people.  Sir Mark Sedwill was the cabinet secretary until September , a period which covered the first phase of the pandemic. We absolutely reject Mr Cummingsapos claims about the Health Secretary, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said. The Health Secretary will continue to work closely with the Prime Minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by iants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic. He insisted the Health Secretary had worked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives. As he arrived at his north London home on Wednesday night, Mr Hancock said: I havenapost seen this performance today in full, and instead Iaposve been dealing with getting the vaccination rollout going, especially to over-s, and saving lives. Iaposll be giving a statement to the House of Commons tomorrow and Iaposll have more to say then. Mr Hancock will appear before the same committee where the series of hard-hitting allegations were levelled on June .  Mr Cummings has previously described Mr Hancockaposs department as a smoking ruin which could not cope with the demands of the pandemic. There were lots of great people in it but the procurement system which they were operating was just completely hopeless, he added on Wednesday. There wasnapost any system set up to deal with proper emergency procurement. At a meeting on March , Mr Cummings said he was told by officials that the DHSC had been turning down ventilators because the price had been marked up - it completely beggars belief that sort of thing was happening. On PPE, Mr Cummings said he was told in meetings that vital masks and gloves were being sent by sea because it is what we always do.  Mr Cummings said: Hang on, we are going to have a peak in the NHS around about mid-April, and you are shipping things from China that are going to arrive in monthsapos time and all the aeroplanes are not flying  Leave this meeting, commandeer the planes, fly them to China, drop them at the nearest airfield, pick up our stuff, fly it back. At this point you had Trump sending the CIA round trying to gazump everybody on PPE. The whole system was just like wading through treacle. He added that the cabinet secretary said the Government had to vy up the Health Secretaryaposs job because there were multiple huge things here that were all being dropped. On the claim that Mr Hancock lied, Mr Cummings said: There are numerous examples. In the summer he said that everybody who needed treatment got the treatment they required. He knew that that was a lie because he had been briefed by the chief scientic adviser and the chief medical officer himself about the first peak. We were told explicitly people did not get the treatment they deserved, many people were left to die in horric circumstances. Mr Hancock had also blamed NHS chief Sir Simon Stevens and Chancellor Rishi Sunak for PPE problems.Mr Cummings said he asked the cabinet secretary to investigate, who came back and said it is completely untrue, I have lost confidence in the Secretary of Stateaposs honesty in these meetings. The former aide said Mr Hancockaposs public promise to deliver , tests a day by the end of April was incredibly stupid because it was already an internal goal. In my opinion he shouldaposve been fired for that thing alone, and that itself meant the whole of April was hugely disrupted by dferent parts of Whitehall fundamentally trying to operate in dferent ways completely because Hancock wanted to be able to go on TV and say aposlook at me and my k targetapos. It was criminal, disgraceful behaviour that caused serious harm. Accusing Mr Hancock of appalling behaviour towards Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick, Mr Cummings said: He used the whole aposweaposre following the scienceapos as a way so that he could always say, aposwellthings go wrong, weaposll blame the scientists and itaposs not my faultapos. He suggested Mr Johnson kept Mr Hancock in place because he was told you should keep him there because heaposs the person you fire when the inquiry comes along. At Prime Ministeraposs Questions, Mr Johnson was asked whether the cabinet secretary had lost faith in the Health Secretaryaposs honesty. Mr Johnson said: The answer to that is aposnoapos and Iaposm afraid I havenapost had the benefit of seeing the evidence that he is bringing to the House, but I must say that I think what the people of this country want us all to do is to get on with the delicate business now of trying to reopen our economy and restore peopleaposs freedoms, get back to our way of le by rolling out the vaccine. PressedMr Johnson still has confidence in the Health Secretary, the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Yes, the Health Secretary has been working closely with the Prime Minister throughout and has been fully focused on protecting the health and care system and saving lives.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCabinetCentral Intelligence AgencyNHSDonald TrumpBoris JohnsonCare homesCivil servantsNursing homesPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"up 30k lives could been","story":"NewsUp to k lives could have been saved by locking down a week earlier, insists expertLockdown architect Professor Neil Ferguson echoed Dominic Cummings claims that tens of thousands of people died unnecessarily because of Government failingsmirrorShareCommentsByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY NewsBoris Johnson has come under fire for lockdown down to late in March  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

His comments came after the PMaposs former top aide Dominic Cummings claimed that tens of thousands of people died who didnapost need to die because of the Governmentaposs failings.Cabinet Minister Robert Jenrick denied the claims, saying we didnapost have all of the facts at the time that the decisions were being taken. But as ministers scramble to contain the fall out from the explosive seven hour Commons hearing on Wednesday, Prof Ferguson echoed Mr Cummings concern that the Government had been slow to act.  The Imperial College expert told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Had we locked down a week earlier - I said at the time - we would have saved half the lives, that really equates too, it was much earlier in the pandemic, so it equates to , to , lives and I think thataposs unarguable. I mean the epidemic was doubling every three to four days in weeks th to rd of March, and so had we moved the interventions back a week we would have curtailed that and saved many lives. Prof Ferguson, who advised the Government before quitting for breaking lockdown rules, said scientists became worried in the week leading up to March   about the lack of a clear plan. SAGE experts realised herd immunity would lead to huge number of deaths, with a key meeting was held with the NHS on March  which finalised estimates around health impacts, so the week after that really, he said. Prof Ferguson said he wasnapost privy to what officials were thinking within government, but added: I would say from the scientic side there was increasing concern that week leading up to the  of March about the lack of clear, letaposs say,resolved plan of what would happen in the next few days in terms of implementing social distancing. He also warned that the June  road map hangs in the balance as experts were still concerned about the spread of the Indian iant. Prof Ferguson said: The key issue as to whether we can go forward is: will the surge caused by the Indian iant - and we do think there will be a surge - be more than has been already planned in to the relaxation measures  So it was always expected that relaxation would lead to a surge in infections and to some extent a small third wave of transmission - thataposs inevitableyou allow contact rates in population to go up, even despite immunity -we canapost cope with that being too large. In the next two or three weeks we will be able to come to a firm assessment of whether itaposs possible to go forward.  His comments came as Mr Jenrick said he rejected Mr Cummingsapos claim that tens of thousands of people died unnecessarily during the pandemic. Asked directly whether he thinks that claim is wrong, he said: Yes, I think it is, because you have to remember that we didnapost have all of the facts at the time that the decisions were being taken. Nobody, I think, could doubt for one moment that the Prime Minister was doing anything other than acting with the best of motives with the information and the advice that was available to him. Mr Jenrick also claimed the PM had handled the pandemic with the utmost seriousness and insisted he has done a great job for the country and deserves our respect.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"before after snaps show hoarders","story":"NewsBefore and after snaps show hoarders homes filled with old food, dust balls and dead ratsChloe Wright, from Frome, Somerset, helps people clear out their cluttered homes - and the results of her work are incredible and often le-changing for her clientsmirrorShareCommentsByCarol DriverZoe ForseyFeatures Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsChloe transforms properties from clutter nightmares to tidy and organised homes \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

While her job is far from glamorous, what she does makes a huge dference to the lives of the people she helps - many of whom have mental health issues. The -year-old, from Frome, Somerset, who runs Goddess Organising, is known for her spotless homes and meticulous organisational skills and is called in to overhaul master bedrooms, kitchens and garages - but sheaposs also been asked to tackle teenagersapos messy bedrooms. She said: “Ninety percent of my clients admit to having postnatal depression, ADHD or mental health problems, anxiety or stress, and that’s why their homes are the way they are, because they can’t face tidying it, while copying with kids, work and stress, then it becomes so big, that it’s too overwhelming.  “What I do isn’t a luxury - it’s a necessity for people. People want others to say it’s OK, you’ve got this disorder, so don’t be ashamed of it. It’s an emergency service, it’s for people who really need it to make themselves feel better. “I also work with self-employed people who are too busy to worry about how messy the garage is, full-time working single parents who are struggling to juggle work, kids and le, and many others. “People often feel embarrassed they need to hire an organiser. That’s why I post before and after pictures, to show people they’re not alone. “I offer decluttering tips and le hacks to help clients keep their homes organised, clutter-free and a peaceful haven for them and their families. “Every story is dferent. There are people whose homes have just run away from them and they need me to come in and press the reset button. “Hoarding is the obsessive need to hang onto things because you’re worried that you may need it one day.” Chloe shares some of her most impressive before and after photos to show potential customers who may be embarrassed to ask for help that they are not alone. Chloe started her business three years as she needed to make some extra cash but wanted a job that would fit around her young son.  Now, her prices start at £ a day depending on the job. She said: “I do come up against a lot of mouldy food, huge dust balls like you wouldn’t believe, dead rodents and funnily enough sex toys. Chloe says her job is all about clearing out the rubbish to make room for the loved, used and needed. “Once a room is decluttered, I can be left to organise it into a more logical fashion.  “I will deep clean each area ready for the new items to find their permanent homes. And then it’s onto the fun bit, the unveiling of the room to the client. This is usually where I get cried on! “I have been described as a whirlwind, superwoman and the obvious one, a true goddess.” The super-organiser says although she doesn’t have counselling training, her clients confide in her, so she helps them to process their feelings and encourages them to say goodbye to some beloved items.  Chloe added: “For most people, being locked down in homes that suppressed them and increased their already stressed minds became the tipping point.” Soon Chloe’s clients started sharing their stories of how she changed their homes and mentally lted a huge weight of their shoulders. Chloe said: “On our initial contact, my customers are shy, withdrawn and apologetic. They feel the need to justy why they need my help. “We all need help with something in our lives after all. I also get cried on a lot.  “Having a stranger arrive who won’t judge, who is solely there to help and promises to make everything go away, tends to open the flood gates of desperation, relief and gratitude. “So many clients cry when I say it is doable. For them to know that someone is going to come in and take over is massive. “To know that tomorrow all the clutter will be gone and left in a more logical and clean organised way is le changing.”  But Chloe says her decluttering plan only worksthe client is completely on board with the process. She explains: “Most average size and cluttered rooms take a day to do. I do have one client whose house may take the rest of the year. “So far, each bedroom has taken two-and-a-half days to complete - and the entire large three-bedroom house is filled with stuff. “I usually have the clients work alongside me as I need them to have an input in the decision making of what stays and what goes. “By touching each item they either feel emotions or they don’t and they soon recognise the items that mean a lot to them and the ones that are just clutter. “The physical and mental energy that is involved in a day’s decluttering is exhausting for all so the idea of having to do this again is off putting enough not to creep stuff back to their lives.” But one of the most important parts of Chloe’s home overhauls is talking to clients about the importance of changing their mindset, so they do not slip back into old habits. Chloeaposs decluttering tipsOpen your curtains and make your bed as soon as you get up in the morning. Only keep what is needed, loved and useful. Everything should have a “home” and put it back into its “home” straight away. Do it straight away.Make every minute count. Avoid bulk buying. Buy something new, get rid of something old.Group like-for-like items togetherDo your weekly shop online. This way you won’t buy “just incase” and you wonapost be tempted by the in-store offers so you’ll save money too.

Hayley and Gary Rolfe said their world came crumbling down when medics discovered their unborn son Cameron had a cm tumour on his left arm eight weeks before he was due.The anxious parents from Middlesbrough described feeling aposnumbapos after discovering their child aposcould possibly have cancerapos, Teesside Live reports.Hayley was monitored for a number of weeks before she was booked in for a caesarean section at Newcastleaposs Royal Victoria Infirmary on April . However, the coupleaposs bundle of joy decided to make an early appearance at just  weeks. Little Cameron was born on April  by emergency c-section at James Cook University Hospital weighing just lb and .oz - but they believe most of that was tumour. The three-week-old is now undergoing treatment where he is expected to remain for between six and  months. Thankfully, doctors have ruled the tumour is not cancerous. Mum-of-two Hayley, , said: I went to a normal growth scan and they found something on the scan that wasnapost right. I went back a couple of days later and they scanned me again and told me and my partner that our baby had a cm tumour. We were transferred to the RVI where we seen the fetal medicine unit. We were at doctors appointments every week.  All the knew was that it was a rare tumour on his left arm and just one in , were diagnosed with it. We were numb, Hayley said. Our world just came crumbling down. Being told your unborn baby might have cancer is just a whole dferent ball game. Doctors booked Hayley in for a caesarean section because of Cameronaposs tumour as they feared she would be unable to give birth naturally because it was bigger than his head. After Cameron was delivered by emergency C-section at James Cook University Hospital he was transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary the same night. Due to his condition, Hayley and Gary, , were unable to enjoy the first moments with their baby, including the skin to skin contact, as he was put into an incubator. Hayley was able to see her newborn son twice but was unable to hold him before he was transferred.  Cameron remains in hospital and in his three short weeks has had four blood transfusions, chemotherapy and is on constant antibiotics. Doctors carried out a biopsy on the tumour and found that it was not cancerous and he has since been diagnosed with infantile myofibroma. Cameron still has full use of his arm and doctors hope chemotherapy will shrink the tumour - which may have to be operated on or the limb could possibly be amputated. Hayley added: At the minute because itaposs so big they donapost want to risk operating because heaposs so little. Iaposd say itaposs just as big as his head. Hayley and Gary are able to stay with their newborn son at the hospital but are rotating in order to look after their four-year-old son Fraser at home. Fraser has not been able to meet his baby brother yet. The family have praised the fantastic health care professionals at the Royal Victoria Infirmary who are looking after Cameron. Cameronaposs tumour developed due to a gene in his body and the family did everything they could right during pregnancy. Despite not being related to Cameronaposs condition, Hayley said it is annoying seeing pregnant women smoking when it may potentially harm their babies after she did everything correctly. Hayley has also set up a fundraising page to help with travel costs, food and clothing during Cameronaposs road to recovery.Donations can be made on the apos Cameronaposs survival fundapos page here.

Most other parts of Britain are set to get up to roughly C. International travel restrictions are one reason so many Brits are heading to the coast in the UK.

Half plan to go at least three times.Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters Last summer, RNLI leguards recorded roughly  million visitors on the beaches the charity was patrolling. This year’s predicted seaside invasion has prompted the RNLI and the Coastguard to launch a beach safety campaign to save lives. The organisations are “very worried” about the public’s safety and are urging people to choose beaches that have leguards.  Of the roughly  bathing beaches, only  have leguards. Gareth Morrison, the RNLI’s head of water safety, said: “We are expecting this summer to be the busiest ever for our leguards and volunteer leboat crews. This is very concerning. Our main advice is to visit a leguarded beach and swim between the red and yellow flags.” He added: “In a normal year, around  people lose their lives accidentally at the coast... With it starting to warm up we are expecting a vast influx to the beach and the coast. “People have been cooped up for so long and... history tells us the more people who go to the beach, unfortunately the more drowning we will see.” In , RNLI leguards saved  lives and helped over , people.

There were three Radford generations on the trip, and it marked their first family outing since lockdown restrictions eased across England.

At home in Morecambe, Lancashire, the family gets through  pints of milk and four loaves of bread a day, as well as  toilet rolls, three tubes of toothpaste and  yoghurts a week. Noel and Sue admit the last year has been chaotic and challenging. “You do feel like you are going a bit crazy because there are so many in the house,” Sue told The Mirror earlier this year. “The weather has been awful recently so there isn’t a lot you can do. You can’t escape either, as there is not a quiet place at home.” But the big day out brought a breath of fresh air and Sue told the Daily Star it had been an absolute treat.The Radfords had their work cut out trying to match the kidsapos energy – but said the children loved it and were completely knackered by the end.

They laughed with the Teletubbies in CBeebies Land and took a stroll in the expansive gardens. Then, they enjoyed a new ride called Gangsta Granny – and the taller children braved the white-knuckle rollercoasters Nemesis and Oblivion. They stayed in the Alton Towers Hotel and explored the resortaposs Enchanted Village, with its fairy-themed woodland lodges.  Sue and Noel said: Alton Towers Resort has been the best family escape we could have hoped for. With a brood as big as ours, itaposs often tricky for us to find somewhere we can all go that everyone will enjoy. Lockdown has been especially hard for Radfords. When Sue went to the supermarket early on in lockdown, people thought she was stockpiling.

The sections of the house and materials were then shipped to the site and assembled with cranes - and the results are absolutely stunning.It took four days for the main structure to go up and the roof to be made watertight, and just another six weeks to install electric and heating, lay the floors, build the stairs and fit the bathroom, as well as all the decorating.Photos show a huge kitchen, dining and living room space with floor to ceiling windows, as well as a covered deck space outside with a sofa to relax.The house, situated on the edge of Delamere Forest, was built in  but is now on sale as the couple are planning a move abroad.Sue, , said: \"We wanted to build an energy-efficient, economical-to-run house with short construction time.\"We loved the project of creating our own home tailored to our specic needs – it reflects who we are.\"The layout could be whatever we wanted it to be – so the freedom of choice was a little overwhelming at first.

Professor Neil Ferguson said that the B... strain could hinder the governmentaposs roadmap out of lockdownit is shown to be much more transmissible than previous iants. The Imperial College London scientist was one of the first to publicly warn of the true danger of Covid- and called for a strict lockdown in February last year. Speaking at a German media briefing today, the SAGE member warned lockdown measures may need to be tightenedthe Indian iant spreads at too fast a rate. His caution came as data showed the mutated virus is now spreading in almost half of Englandaposs -plus authorities. Against that backdrop, Professor Ferguson said it was impossible to say whether the June  date for the final lockdown lting would go ahead.  Itaposs not how high cases rise, but how quickly, he said, Sky reported. If they double every - days and hospital admissions follow the same trend, then there is a concern.  We were expecting cases to rise as we relaxed restrictions butthey rise too quickly thataposs a problem. Today the UK registered , new Covid- cases, the highest daily number since April .  It is too soon to say whether this is part of a consistent upwards trend, however. The number of cases reported each day has been broadly flat for the past month, sometimes dipping below ,but mostly staying between , and ,. Some parts of the country, particularly those where the Indian iant is known to be running rampant, have seen big increases in case rates. By contrast, Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire recorded a week-on-week rise in rates of . , Clackmannanshire in Scotland saw a rise of . , and Bolton in Greater Manchester saw a rise of . .  There are reasons to be cheerful however. Case rates in the vast majority of areas continue to remain at levels last seen in late summer or early autumn , with around four in five areas currently recording rates below  cases per ,. The vaccine rollout continues to go well, with ,, people have had a first dose and ,, a second one.  To further gladden the heart, the Indian iant may prove to be less of an issue than some have feared, Professor Ferguson has said.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeMatt Hancock appeared to dismiss sensational claims made by Dominic Cummings that he was a aposliarapos who should have been sacked. Among a string of explosive claims the ex-advisor said Mr Hancock should have been fired over Covid failings and criminal, disgraceful behaviour on the testing target. In response the Health Secretary told reporters he had not seen the aposperformanceapos in full and was busy apossaving lives.aposOn Wednesday Dominic Cummings delivered a seven-hour searing assessment of incompetence, failure and arrogance at the top of government.He claimed the PM was consistently anti-lockdown, ignored scientic advice and failed to take Covid seriously - even ranting last summer that he should never have done Lockdown .  He also took aim at Matt Hancock whom he branded “disgraceful” - and potentially “criminal.” As he arrived at his north London home last night, Mr Hancock was asked for his reaction to the allegations to MPs. He replied: I havenapost seen this performance today in full, and instead Iaposve been dealing with getting the vaccination rollout going, especially to over-s, and saving lives. Iaposll be giving a statement to the House of Commons tomorrow and Iaposll have more to say then. Downing Street did not deny that the Prime Minister considered sacking the Health Secretary in April last year but insisted Mr Johnson has confidence in him now, as Mr Hancock disputed the allegations. Mr Cummings said there were around  reasons why Mr Hancock should have been thrown out of the Cabinet - including, he claimed, lying both in meetings and publicly. Mr Hancock used chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance as shields to blame for his failures, Mr Cummings claimed. He said Mr Hancock performed disastrously below the standards expected and the cabinet secretary - the countryaposs top civil servant - recommended the Health Secretary should be sacked.Mr Cummings said that while Donald Trump was ordering the CIA to gazump rival countries on orders for personal protective equipment , the Department of Health and Social Carewas still trying to get orders from China by ship. I think the Secretary of State for Health shouldaposve been fired for at least ,  things, including lying to everybody on multiple occasions in meeting after meeting in the Cabinet room and publicly, Mr Cummings said. Thereaposs no doubt at all that many senior people performed far, far disastrously below the standards which the country has a right to expect. I think the Secretary of State for Health is certainly one of those people.Mr Hancock was lined up to lead a coronavirus press conference from Downing Street on Thursday as he rejected Mr Cummingsapos allegations.We absolutely reject Mr Cummingsapos claims about the Health Secretary, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said. The Health Secretary will continue to work closely with the Prime Minister to deliver the vaccine rollout, tackle the risks posed by iants and support the NHS and social care sector to recover from this pandemic. He insisted the Health Secretary had worked incredibly hard in unprecedented circumstances to protect the NHS and save lives. Mr Hancock will appear before the same committee where the series of hard-hitting allegations were levelled on June .FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Julia Samuel borrowed the sweet idea from her pal Princess Diana and had a special surprise in store for Georgeaposs seventh birthday in July . Ms Samuel, , was a long-time friend of Diana and is godmother to both Prince William and George. She described how she buys aposimpossibleapos toys for the family that William then spends days attempting to put together with cautious assembling. Ms Samuel said: “I do to George what [Diana] did to us, which is give impossible toys that are really noisy and take a lot of making. “William then has to spend days putting together. And then put all the machinery together, and it makes awful tooting noises and lights flashing and all of that.” Seeing William putting the toys together with dficulty is an endless source of amusement for the family - especially for cheeky George. Watching William struggle to assemble the toys “makes me laugh, and it makes George laugh”, she added.Ms Samuel made the comments as she appeared on the podcast How to Fail with Elizabeth Day. Ms Samuel added that George is amazing — Heaposs funny and feisty and cheeky and God she [Diana] would have loved him so much, she said. That is heartbreaking for all of them. The podcast was released on July  , on what would have been Princess Dianaaposs th birthday. Ms Samuel also said her favorite memory of the royal was her laugh. Therapist Ms Samuel was forced to apologise on TV last year as she promoted a new book on ITVaposs Lorraine.She turned the air blue and said a rude word while speaking about how people can cope while having a bad day. Ms Samuel said: You would go to your friend, “I’m having a s***e week,” I’m not sleeping, Iaposm furious with so and so I did a terrible show, something, something, somethingapos.  And then by the time you’ve had a cup of coffee and you’ve had a hug and you’ve roared with laughter maybe you’ve watched something funny on telly, it lessens. Whereasyou keep that in your system it kind go grows and gets bigger.

Her Majesty reportedly gave her approval for her grandson to work with Oprah Winfrey on a TV documentary about mental health amongst military veterans back in , when relations among the Royal Family members were in better shape.Now she and Prince Charles have been left gobsmacked by the claims the young royal has made in the show three years later, MailOnline reports. In the brand new docuseries - The Me You Canapost See - Harry sits down with Oprah to discuss his shock and pain at his motheraposs death, and how the Royal Family allegedly did aposnothing to help himapos.Having taken up therapy four years ago after meeting his we Meghan Markle, Harry says heaposs finally free to talk about his innermost feelings, while suggesting Charles had allowed his children to suffer. Following the shows airing trust between Harry and his relatives is said to be wearing thin. While the prince sat down with the Queen and Meghanaposs dad Thomas to discuss the idea of a multi-part documentary series on AppleTV, the way it was pitched was unrecognisable from the final product, insiders have claimed.  Instead sources told the Mail the idea centred around the importance of military veterans getting the right mental health support after ing to civilian le. Instead the final product focuses more on Harryaposs own mental health problems. It is a question of trust, and honestly any of that is hanging by a thread at the moment, an insider told Mail Online.  No one within the Palace circles has anything but sympathy for Harryaposs trauma and troubled le, but there is upset and discomfort at him sharing it on an international television show. Certainly the intimate detail of his hardships paint a very negative picture of his family and upbringing. In  Prince Harry announced the five-part AppleTV project which aimed to highlight and destigmatize mental health challenges.He wrote at the time: I truly believe that good mental health – mental fitness – is the key to powerful leadership, productive communities and a purpose-driven self. It is a huge responsibility to get this right as we bring you the facts, the science and the awareness of a subject that is so relevant during these times. I am incredibly proud to be working alongside Oprah on this vital series. In the first episode the Duke of Sussex opens up about his mental health dficulties.  I wasnapost in an environment where it was encouraged to talk about it either, that was kind of squashed, he said of his time within The Firm.the past, to heal myself from the past. I always wanted to be normal, to just be Harry. Harry levelled a number of complaints at his birth family, accusing them of apostotal neglectapos when it came to him asking for help.  He said that he and Meghan - along with son Archie - spent four years trying to make it work but their requests for help when Meghan was suicidal were met with total silence, total neglect. We did everything that we possibly could to stay there and carry on doing the role and doing the job, he stated. But Meghan was struggling. That feeling of being trapped within the family, there was no option to leave, he went on. Eventually when I made that decision for my family, I was still told, aposYou canapost do thisapos. And itaposs like, aposWell how bad does it have to get until I am allowed to do this apos She [Meghan] was going to end her le. It shouldnapost have to get to that.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnBuckingham PalaceThe QueenPrince HarryMeghan MarkleOprah WinfreyPrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"rise covid cases not national","story":"NewsRise in Covid cases not a national trend yet as fears over Indian iant growPlaces such as Blackburn with Darwen and Bolton have become Indian coronavirus iant hotspots, but it is too soon to say whether localised spikes are part of a broader patternmirrorShareCommentsByIan JonesChris KitchingSenior News ReporterMilo Boyd:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video dominic-cummings-gives-scathing-account-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:xGJsJmfm,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

It is too soon to say whether this will develop into a broader, nationwide pattern of increased infections.New figures were announced as the scientist behind the first lockdown a year ago warned that the Indian iant could lead to tighter restrictions. A total of , new cases were reported on Wednesday, the highest daily number since April , when , infections were announced. Have you been affected by the Indian coronavirus iant  Email your story to webnews@mirror.  Compared with previous Wednesdays, the total was an increase of  per cent on the , infections that were confirmed on April . It was the third straight Wednesday with a week-on-week increase - the UK reported , cases on May , , on May  and , on May . The number of cases reported each day has been broadly flat for the past month, sometimes dipping below ,but mostly staying between , and ,. The seven-day rolling average has crept upwards slightly in recent days. However, more data is needed to see whether this is the start of a continuous nationwide increase and not simply a short-term response to a spike in cases in a few hotspots. Separate data for cases by local area suggests that only a small number of places in the UK are currently recording a rise in cases that is greater than the usual day-to-day fluctuation in numbers.  Of the  UK local areas,  saw a jump in Covid- rates in the seven days to May , based on the latest figures available for cases by specimen date. But of these  areas,  recorded increases that were in single figures. By contrast, Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire recorded a week-on-week rise in rates of . , Clackmannanshire in Scotland saw a rise of . , and Bolton in Greater Manchester saw a rise of . . Meanwhile, case rates in the vast majority of areas continue to remain at levels last seen in late summer or early autumn , with around four in five areas currently recording rates below  cases per ,. Wednesdayaposs jump in the number of reported cases does not reflect a nationwide trend and, although cases have risen in some areas of the UK, it is too early to say whether these localised spikes are part of a broader pattern that could be linked to the recent easing of lockdown restrictions. On Wednesday, Professor Neil Ferguson, the scientist behind the first lockdown in , warned that the Indian iant could lead to tighter restrictions. The Sage member said the B... strain could hinder the Governmentaposs roadmap out of lockdownit is shown to be much more transmissible than previous iants. He warned lockdown measures may need to be tightenedthe Indian iant spreads at too fast a rate.

The Royal Geographical Society has come up with a list of Seven Wonders of Nature in the UK, bringing together all the beautul and unique geological sites Britainaposs nature has to offer. Pistyll Rhaeadr waterfallat Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant has made it onto the list of natural landmarks, a waterfall just inside the Welsh border and which at ft is thought to be one of Britainaposs highest. The majestic waterfall is made of streams originating in the Berwyn Mountains, falling in three stages to form the Afon Rhaeadr. It joined other top locations such as Loch Coruisk and the Cuillins, Wastwater, Dovedale, the Needles, the Jurassic Coast and the Giantaposs Causeway.What do you think of this selection of beauty spots  Let us know in the comments section below.However, a new survey commissioned as part of the project revealed a lack of knowledge of the UK’s most revered natural landmarks, the WalesOnline reports. A staggering  per cent of those polled admitted to not having heard of all the Seven Wonders. Survey results showed that  per cent of UK adults have incredibly never visited any of the Seven Wonder landmarks – with the Jurassic Coast being the most visitedand Pistyll Rhaeadr being the least visited . The survey, of , people, was commissioned by outdoor specialists Merrell ahead of the launch of its new MOAB footwear collection and revealed that more than half of UK adults are more likely to visit one the UK’s best beauty spots than they were pre-coronavirus. Results from the survey also suggests the pandemic has made the public more open to UK travel with  per cent stating they were more open to exploring unfamiliar places in the UK, more than they were before the pandemic. Television presenter Mary-Ann Ochota, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society said: “One of the few positives to come out of the pandemic is the opportunity many of us have had to explore the natural wonders on our doorsteps. And hopefully this summer will offer even more chances to explore new places in the UK. This list will have a couple of sites that might be familiar, but there’s also likely to be some hidden gems that you might never have heard of. These seven locations are really extraordinary – I think most of us would be amazed to learn that they’re right here in our own country. Simon Sweeney, UK marketing manager at Merrell, said: “The Natural Wonders have been devised to inspire native exploration and celebrate nature’s greatest gts in the UK. The other six Natural Wonders of the UK  Wastwater, Lake District Surrounded by some of the Lake District’s tallest mountains, Wastwater lies in one of the wildest and most dramatic valleys of the National Park. The valley of Wasdale was created by Ice Age glaciers carving out U-shaped hollows in the hard volcanic rocks. Although the Ice Age began about . million years ago, it was the latest period o f intense cold, about , years ago, that caused the striking features seen today in the Lake District.  Giant’s Causeway, Northern Ireland The Giant’s Causeway lies on the coast of County Antrim in Northern Ireland. The area was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in  due to it being ‘a spectacular area of global geological importance.” The geological features of the Causeway were formed around - million years ago, when the Antrim Coast was subjected to intense volcanic activity. The most characteristic and unique feature of the site is the regular polygonal basalt columns - estimates suggest that there are approximately , columns around the Causeway.  Dovedale, Peak District Located in the Peak District, Dovedale is a stretch of the Dove Valley where the Dove River tumbles through impressive limestone ravines. The limestone rock of Dovedale and the wider Peak District consists of the fossilised remains of marine le from the Carbonerous period,  million years ago when the area was underneath a shallow tropical sea. At the end of the Ice Age, vast quantities of meltwater cut through the layers of limestone leaving behind the limestone rock formations like those found in Dovedale.  The Needles, Isle of Wight The Needles form the western tip of a backbone of chalk that crosses the centre of the Isle of Wight, with three distinctive, jagged, chalk stacks that extend into the sea. However, the fourth and taller, needle-like stack that gave its name to these rocks, known as ‘Lot’s Weapos, collapsed during a storm in .  Jurassic Coast, Dorset Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in  due to the global importance of its rocks, fossils and geological landforms, the Jurassic Coast is a -mile stretch of coast from Orcombe Point in Exmouth, Devon to the Old Harry Rocks, near Swanage in Dorset. The site provides an almost continuous sequence of rock formations covering the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods, known collectively as the Mesozoic Era, and is internationally renowned for its contribution to the study of earth sciences over the past  years.  Loch Coruisk  the Cuillins Loch Coruisk, meaning ‘Cauldron of Waters’ in Scottish Gaelic, is an in-land, freshwater loch situated in the heart of the Cuillins on the Isle of Skye. Whilst the head of the loch is surrounded on three sides by the imposing volcanic Black Cuillins, the southern end connects to the sea by the Scavaig River which discharges into Loch Scavaig. Following a visit to Dunvegan Castle, Sir Walter Scott visited Loch Coruisk in , describing it as that dread lake in his poem ‘The Lord of the Isles’.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnUnited Nations Educational, Scientic, and Cultural OrganizationRoyal FamilyWaterfallsCoronavirusNatural wonders"},{"url":null,"title":"teenager metres being crushed collapsing","story":"NewsTeenager metres from being crushed by collapsing house casually keeps on walkingA doorbell camera captured the moment Ryan Puttick walked past a house in Christchurch, Dorset only for a large part of its end wall to crash down onto a car in the streetmirrorShareCommentsByMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video man-street-nearly-crushed-death-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:IWTLciQ,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Calm and collected Ryan Puttick was making his way along a road in Christchurch, Dorset on May . Suddenly the top portion of a houseaposs side wall tears away and crashes down into the road below. Instead of panicking or running away, the -year-old nonchalantly carries on his journey after a large part of the house smashed down into the road metres away from him. In footage of the incident captured on a doorbell camera a strong wind can be seen and heard whipping across the scene. As the teenager, hunched over against the breeze, passes a writhing tree a triangle shaped section of bricks comes loose. How do you think you would of reacted  Tell us in the comments below.  It hurtles down onto a silver car below, leaving it covered in bricks and causing a huge bang. Ryan then pauses slightly but does not stop altogether, instead erting his course around the pile of rubble and on. Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue service tweeted that the road was closed due to the unsafe structure after the incident. Ryan was on his way to catch a train for a college exam when the gable end of a house collapsed.  He decided to carry on so not to miss his train and exam.I know the video looks like I was fine, like it was a normal thing, but inside I was really, really nervous, really shook up, Ryan told the BBC. He said he was thinking about how he could get out of here as smoothly, as swtly as possible. A woman who lives close to the collapsed home said: I was in my living room when I heard a loud bang and it made me jump because the house was shaking. I came out to see the wall on the floor, itaposs just really shocking. The teenageraposs ice cold reaction has impressed many who perhaps harbour a healthier respect for falling buildings.This guy needs an award for just being cool, one woman wrote on Twitter.One man said: This guy. Cool as a cucumber. Nothing to see ‘ere, carries on walking. Another added: I absolutely love the nonchalance of this pedestrian.

Not exactly ideal. But was it actually possible for them to avoid this and get the sofa into the flat  Flatshare site SpareRoom have used maths to reveal that, yes, it would have been possible -only theyaposd been sure to TILT as well as PIVOT.By analysing the iconic scene in meticulous detail and estimating the dimensions of the stairs and the couchSpareRoom and data science consultant Caroline Zunckel PhD have produced an equation and methodology explaining how Ross could have moved the couch into his flat. According to the in-depth workings and diagrams, the mathematical solution would have saved Ross hundreds of pounds. The findings might even come in useful for real-le flatmates in a similar situation to Ross,they’re mathematically inclined, that is.  So how should it have been done ! The killer equation Ross needed to get his couch around the corner and up the stairs: Angle of vertical tilt. -.xWS+ .xWC+ .xLCStep : First Ross should have measured the width of the stairs WS , and the width WCandLCof the couch.Step : Ross then should have used the equation to find out the minimum angle Tthat the couch would need to be tilted upwards to move around the -degree corner of the stairwell.Step : After carrying the couch to the corner Ross, Rachel and Chandler reach a point where they can’t move any more. When this happens Ross, Rachel and Chandler should have rested the couch against the corner.Step : Here the friends should have tilted the couch vertically towards the ceiling until the angle between the stairs and the base of the couch was greater than or equal to T . At this point the verticalof the couch would be smaller than the horizontaland they should have been able to successfully pivot the couch round the corner without it getting stuck.Step : Once round the corner Ross, Rachel and Chandler should have moved the couch back to its original orientation and the carried it up to the flat. Caroline Zunckel commented: By applying Pythagoras’ theorem to the estimated measurements of Ross’s sofa in a vertical position and dimensions of the stairwell, I was able to establish that it would have been possible for Ross to get the sofa up the stairwell and into the flat without resorting to the extreme measure of chopping it in half. It’s quite simple really! Matt Hutchinson, SpareRoom Director added: We know moving new furniture into a flat can be challenging. Ross isn’t the only one to end up with his couch stuck in a stairwell or corridor. Although the research contains some headache-inducing maths, the solution for Ross is pretty simple: ‘pivot’ and ‘tilt’ - and take a little time to measure up before you buy any furniture. That, or, hire in the professionals!”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMaths-WhizzFriendsDavid SchwimmerJenner AnistonMatthew Perry"},{"url":null,"title":"mortified mum confused postman smirks","story":"NewsMortied mum confused as postman smirks handing over parcel - then reads labelChloe Lythgoe says she has resigned herself to \"years of embarrassment\" when she has to face her postman after her online Amazon order came with the product name printed on the labelmirrorShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsSenior Audience Writer:,  JUL Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video young-mum-mortied-smirking-amazon-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:FPxFzO,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Chloe Lythgoe received an alert on her phone that a delivery was arriving, when she said she saw the driver walking up the path and smiling to himself. As she signed for the package, she realised the name of the X-rated sex toy inside was printed on the label - right next to the barcode the postal worker had to scan first. I opened the door and he handed it over, smirking ashe knew what was in the box, she sad.  It was awful, I looked at him asto say aposplease, I hope youaposve not seen itapos and he looked back to say aposI know whataposs in thereapos. The -year-old ordered the £ adult toy from Amazon, with the product delivery details promising to make discretion aposa primary considerationapos. But Chloe, from Warrington, says she now feels aposmortiedapos every time she has to answer the door to face her postie. I went bright red, just closed the door and thought apostypical meapos, she said. I just wanted the ground to open up and eat me, it was less than discreet.  I opened the door in my dressing gown too with my kids stood behind me wondering who was at the door with my hair up in a aposmum bunapos - I bet I looked the part. I felt so embarrassed. Even now when he comes to the door I can’t look at him in the eye, just knowing he knows what I get up to makes me cringe. He still delivers all my parcels and every time I open the door I think aposoh why  Please changeapos. Iaposve got years of embarrassment to come.  The full-time mum-of-three ordered the product after it was recommended by friends, deciding to go for it and try something new. Chloe said her pals felt her embarrassment when she told them the story and added: On the page it said it was discreet and I thought that was fine.When I told my friends, surprisingly they asked me how it was, so the company has sold quite a few [off the back of] my [Facebook] story, I believe.An Amazon spokesperson said: Amazon is investigating the issue.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnSex toysViral"},{"url":null,"title":"tragic final photo boy taken","story":"NewsTragic final photo of boy taken moments before cable car crash killed his parentsEitan Biran, , was the only survivor of the tragic crash in northern Italy that killed both his parents among  victimsmirrorShareByClaire Gilbody-DickersonNews reporterAdam Barnett:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsEitan lost his parents Amit Biran, , Tal, , as well as his two-year-old brother Tom and his great-grandparents \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

In a haunting final photo taken moments before the crash, Eitan can be seen looking out the window of the cable car in northern Italy, standing next to his great-grandfather, moments before the crash, according to The Sun. The cable car was travelling from Stresa, on Lake Maggiore, to Mottarone mountain in Italyaposs Alps. Investigators said on Monday their initial probe into the disaster would look into how the lead cable snapped and why a safety brake mechanism failed to activate. The cable car was approaching a station on top of the ,ft Mottarone mountain when it plunged, rolled down the steep terrain and crashed into trees. It is believed the lead cable tragically snapped as it approached its final stop in the -minute trip. Italian prosecutors have opened an investigation into suspected involuntary manslaughter and negligence. Public prosecutor Olimpia Bossi said: We are starting from the empirical evidence. The cable sheared and the system of safety brakes clearly did not work,  Transport and Infrastructure Minister Enrico Giovannini visited the area on Monday and said the government would also set up a commission to look into Italyaposs worst cable car disaster since .That year  people died after a low-flying US warplane accidentally cut through a supporting cable. He said: The government, as well all the institutions, are naturally committed to understanding the causes, to understanding what happened.  The cable car underwent major maintenance work between  and . Checks were carried out in  and again last year by specialist technicians.Italian media reported that the wires were not due to be replaced until . The cabin could hold up to  people, but was less than half full because of restrictions to prevent COVID- infections.

We want to be in the top six.mdash SPFLMay , “I talk to Steve Brown quite often and, watching him after the match at the weekend, he was in tears. That’s how much that meant to him.“To do the double is almost like Leicester winning the league and things like this can happenyou get on a right run and get the right guy.”While he did not replicate Brown’s tears as he undertook rare media duties, it was evident just how important promotion was to Nelms following a two-year exile from the Premiership.And he has no intention of ever going through that again.“This year has been very dficult to navigate as we had no idea what was happening,” Nelms added candidly. “Being in the Championship really laser focuses your attention — as did being in the middle of a pandemic.“Everything we did was a proper graft and I couldn#t be more pleased with the manager and his staff.“We never want to be back in the Championship again. It is a hard slog to get out of this league and we don#t want to be there.“We are always trying to learn to make sure we don#t make those mistakes again. We will try to do things a dferent way and the right way.”mdash SPFLMay , However, Nelms is adamant that does not mean ‘starving’ McPake of funds as the Dundee gaffer seeks to build a top-flight squad.“We will have a look at [strengthening] but we have never starved our manager of finances,” he added. “Within reason, we will do what we have to and try to build a proper, sound, stable team.”Dundee star Jason Cummings in Instagram nod to classic Only Fools and Horses scene after chandelier celebration\" title\"#Dundee star Jason Cummings in Instagram nod to classic Only Fools and Horses scene after chandelier celebration# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundee-star-jason-cummings-in-instagram-nod-to-classic-only-fools-and-horses-scene-after-chandelier-celebration embed # secrethmOPKNd\" data-secret\"hmOPKNd\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"grew-glasgow-its-best-city-world---alexanders-gallowgate-memories","story":"Earliest memory of Glasgow  I remember being scared when the bombs were dropping on Glasgow during the Second World War."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-janey-buchan-fierce-glasgow-mep-fought-civil-rights","story":" Janey Buchan was a fierce cultural and political activist.

has praised the school’s response to the recent Covid surge in Moray – thanking parents and the community for the part they played.Dozens of positive cases were recorded among students and staff

families and staff to get tested while more than  youngsters were forced to self-isolate at times.Elgin Academy head teacher Kyle Scott has now revealed there has been no Covid cases at the school for

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le. As the founders of the NHS said: #From the cradle to the grave#.Hiding in plain sight in this report, in the small print, is this statement: #Politicians, health care professionals and the public must all be involvedour primary care system is to survive.# As Oprah Winfrey would put it, #WHAT # If this is what is at stake, why have we not heard more about it  Why was it enough to contact so few people among our erse population Why has health management locally cast our group out in the cold We are open to all and represent a wide cross section of community interests. And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With their strong Gaelic and Norse heritage they defied the will of kings, and their political influence was undeniable.This independence of spirit might account, in part at least, for a modern-day habit of Islay folk # to enter the world of politics.With the election earlier this month of Jenni Minto as constituency MSP, the island now has three serving Argyll and Bute politicians, with council leader Councillor Robin Currie and Councillor Alastair Redman.Orkney and Shetland LibDem MP Alistair Carmichael, another Ileach, can be added to the list # and there may be more out there.Then there is George Robertson # now Lord Robertson of Port Ellen # former Labour politician and Secretary General of NATO, and the much-respected late Labour leader John Smith, both of whom have Islay connections.All of the above from an island of little more than , people.The Argyllshire Advertiser decided to ask the politicians themselves for their theories about why Islay has the habit of producing a preponderance of politicians.Leader of Argyll and Bute Council Robin Currie explained: #Ileachs are known for their sense of community, their enthusiasm for their island and their culture, and their erse mix of skills and resilience # so it#s no surprise that so many of us want to take that a stage further by representing not only our own island but the whole of Argyll and Bute, or indeed the country itself, as is the case with George Robertson and the late John Smith.#All of these characteristics will stand anyone in good stead when it comes to le as an elected representative, whether that’s at local or national government level.#It#s great that [in Argyll and Bute] we have a good balance of elected representatives of all political flavours, who understand the needs and characteristics of that mix of communities, and who can bring that knowledge together to work on issues of strategic as well as local importance.#Councillor Currie added: #It goes without saying that I wish my fellow Ileach, Jenni Minto, every success in her new role and I look forward to working with her.#Conservative Alastair Redman # one of three councillors serving Kintyre and the Isles alongside Councillor Currieand Tarbert#s Anne Horn# pointed to Islay#s #unique economy and location# as part of the reason for its political prominence.#Islay is both rural and at the same time heavily industrialised with our large number of distilleries,# he said.#It might be considered isolated yet is a global trading powerhouse. We on Islay have a population of just a few thousand yet our name is world famous.#There is also our history which to a degree separates us from mainland Scotland. Finlaggan was the seat of the Lords of the Isles under Clan Donald with roots that go back beyond the Kingdom of Scotland, beginning with Somerled in the th century.#I feel that this has led to Ileachs being more independent and perhaps at times more forthright than others.#I hope that many more councillors, MSPs, MPs, cabinet ministers, lords and even prime ministers will come from my home island which, though small, has made a huge mark on this world.#The last word goes to the newest member of Islay#s political gang, Jenni Minto MSP.The SNP member also cited the island#s past influence on Scottish politics through Finlaggan and the Lordship of the Isles.And she highlighted more examples of single-minded Ileachs making their mark on the world.#In - three ships with Islay people on board sailed for the New York colony,# said Ms Minto.#On one of these was five-year-old Alexander McDougall, who became a key figure in America’s war for independence. He had a very successful le, rising to the rank of Major General in the continental army. He then entered public service and was elected to the New York state senate. On his death he was described by George Washington as one of the five pillars of the American revolution.##I am not Islay-born,# she continued, #but feel very lucky to live on such a wonderful island. I often describe it as the centre of the universe, and there are very few places you can visit without meeting someone from Islay or someone who has a connection with the island.#I think that coming from, or living on, an island you need a level of resilience and creativity but you also have a true sense of community and working together.#Islay is also known to be a friendly place, where everyone has time to chat and listen to other people’s thoughts and views.#I think all of these traits are needed in politics and so perhaps it is not a surprise that Islay people have entered public service.#PICS:Jenni Minto MSP. no_aScotElection_McglynnArgyll and Bute Council leader, Robin Currie. aelectionCurrienoCouncillor Alastair Redman.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"reduce farm costs save time and make life easier","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Feedback was provided by  managers # a response rate of  per cent.#Councillor Lynch, who represents the Oban South and the Isles ward, said: #I must confess I am disappointed to have only a  per centrate on the survey.#We are talking about reviewing a policy. How can we move the figure up and ensure we get all managers contributing #Jane Fowler, head of improvement and HR with the council, responded: #We would have loved to have had a greater response to that. These things come with conflicting pressures on managers’ time, which is why we offer the opportunity to be part of a working group.#The performance in getting responses to surveys is something we want to improve. We have had communications about how to pick it up.#Councillor Findlay, one of three members for the Isle of Bute ward, then asked: #Should it be compulsory for managers to complete the survey #It is vital that managers lead and lead well, so I am quite disappointed by the response.#Ms Fowler replied: #We try to avoid compulsion because we are trying to work collaboratively with our colleagues. We look to get as wide a representation as we can.#Feedback to the nature of the policy itself was more positive, with SNP Helensburgh and Lomond South councillor Richard Trail saying: #I welcome this change of emphasis, changing the policy from talking about absence to supporting attendance.#This, we hope, will improve attendance, but how will we measure that in the months and years ahead  Have you any kind of measures you will be able to bring to us ##We have detailed information on what our absences have been like during Covid,# responded Ms Fowler. #We had a requirement to report on it on a weekly basis.#We will see levels of absence reported on scorecards so members can see what our rates of absence are. We have also, over the last year, introduced information broken down to service level.#"},{"url":null,"title":"julie-forrest-loses-open-singles-world-bowls-competition","story":"BORDERS bowler Julie Forrest has been knocked out of the open singles at the World Indoor Bowls Championships .Forrest lost her last- match todayagainst Englandrsquos Greg Harlow, the competitionrsquos sixth seed.Forrest, from Hawick, shared the opening set -, but she was defeated -

of his Commons appearance and Downing Street press conference, saying he was ldquojust off to drive forward the vaccine programme as he left his north-west London home.Cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick said he was sorry for the Governmentrsquos ldquoerrors and mistakes during the pandemic but insisted Mr Hancock and his department had worked ldquoincredibly hard during the crisis.The fallout continued from Mr Cummingsrsquo seven-hour evidence session to MPs, during which he claimed his former boss Boris Johnson was ldquounfit to lead and his Governmentrsquos failures had led to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths.Apart from his damning assessment of the Prime Minister, Mr Cummings saved his fiercest criticism for Mr Hancock over failings around care homes policy, personal protective equipmentprocurement and his public pledge on a testing target which caused disruption in Whitehall.Communities Secretary Mr Jenrick told Sky News: ldquoI think the Department for Health and the Health Secretary have worked exceptionally hard over the course of this pandemic.ldquoThis was an unprecedented situation, it was a national effort involving all parts of Government in all

and wanted to be injected with Covid- on television in a bid to calm the nation.Mr Cummings, who was ousted from No  late last year as part of a behind-the-scenes power struggle, said that, by the end

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

Commissioned by Our Scottish Future, the pro-Union think tank, it had two headlines. Less than a quarter of Scots think that the Scottish and UK Governments cooperate well today.Nearly three-quarters want better cooperation. Not earth-shattering you might say. Human beings working together ndash itrsquos what we do, right  Amazingly, the poll found  per cent who disagreed. I had no idea the professional political class was so large.Okay, so that last bit is a bit unfair. However, politics is a brutal and competitive business. Greasy poles are not climbed by being nice to your opponents. Point scoring is second nature. Little wonder the population watches on wearily, itching to knock heads together.Nowhere is an inability to rub along more clear than in the fractious relationship between the Scottish and UK Governments. Lack of trust and confidence is re on both sides. UK ministers question whether Scottish counterparts, whose mission is to break up the country, are acting in good faith. Scottish ministers complain the UK Government disrespects their constitutional position.:Coronavirus: Pandemic: Take responsibility  Notyoure a Tory ministerAs in any troubled relationship both sides have a point. I recall extolling to a senior SNP leader the virtues of improving how the UK works. His reply was short and commendably frank: ldquoIrsquove no interest in strengthening the Union. And last year a senior UK Government lsquoinsiderrsquo vouchsafed to this newspaperrsquos UK Political Editor the thought that Boris Johnson ldquooutranks Nicola Sturgeon and ldquohas the pips on the collar.These remarks betray attitudes, which to outsiders appear petty and tiresome. The UK Government springs on devolved administrations a nasty surprise in the form of the UK Internal Market Bill. The Scottish Government refuses to collaborate on improving Scotlandrsquos connections with the rest of the UK. And wonrsquot play ball on developing Freeports, preferring exceptionalist Scottish Greenports ndash asports canrsquot be both free and green.For both, this is short-sighted. Separating Scotland from the rest of the UK is a very bad idea. However,thatrsquos your poison, is it really smart to demonstrate yoursquore incapable of working constructively with your nearest neighbour One whose currency you intend to use on departure, whilst leaving monetary policy in its central bankrsquos hands. And one on whose goodwill yoursquore relying to negotiate favourable lsquoScexitrsquo terms. Thatrsquos why Alex Salmond used to warble on about Scotlandrsquos place in six Unions ndash including a UK social union ndash and turning Scotland from surly lodger to good neighbour.If you think wersquore better together, then the job is surely to show Scots the value of having two governments batting for them that within the UK, Scotland doesnrsquot have to rely on a neighbourrsquos goodwill. Because when the UK Government negotiates with the Scottish Government a new post-Brexit subsidy regime, governance of the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, internal market exemptions or Scotlands fiscal framework, itrsquos not promoting Englandrsquos interests, but those of the whole country including Scotland.Fostering greater trust and confidence isnrsquot impossible. Building better relationships, however, requires investment of time and effort.Sadly, itrsquos not de rigueur these days to speak warmly of David Cameron. Yet in  Nicola Sturgeon said this about him: ldquoDavid Cameron, whose politics and mine are very far apart, always managed to have a personal rapport. You could sit with David and have a fairly frank discussion, agree on the things you could agree and accept you disagree on everything , and have a bit of banter as well. The fruits of that relationship were a fiscal framework agreed, City and Growth Deals for every part of Scotland struck and much more besides.:Andy Maciver: How Ruth Davidson could have become First Minister ndash an alternative historyWith the elections behind us, is it too much to hope for a move from Cold War to a new spirit of detente  More in tune with the national mood and an overwhelming desire to pick ourselves up after Covid.Early signs encourage. The PM is right to reach out to devolved leaders, inviting them to an early summit. And just before the recent election campaign, the UK Government published proposals, developed jointly with devolved governments, to strengthen how they work together. They reveal an impressive package of necessary reforms, most of which is already agreed. Remaining gaps seem easily bridgeable.Are they really going to fall out over what to call the new devolution council  Word of advice ndash the more clunkily contrived the name, the more likely the media will apply a colloquial, short-hand, alternative.And some UK ministers are apparently reluctant for the Foreign Office to establish an inter-ministerial forum for dialogue with devolved administrations because foreign policy is reserved. This is the tin-hatted defensiveness too often bedevilling inter-governmental relations. Is this really the ditch in which some ministers are prepared to die rather than have a package agreed  Unless Scottish ministersrsquo passports are to be revoked, wouldnrsquot it be better to take opportunities to explain to them why trashing abroad the UKrsquos brand isnrsquot the best way of promoting Scotlandrsquos So get that package of reform agreed as soon as possible, Prime Minister.

When we had to close down our Centre once Covid hit, we knew we had to somehow keep our services going.With lack of income from the groups who use the centre, we have suffered a financial haemorrhage, resulting in a shortfall of pound, and I recognise there is a long road to recovery.Finances notwithstanding, I can only pay tribute to our board of trustees who continued to support and enable us to keep operational and my amazing team which turned our operations into a online continuation of service within  hours.The team worked within the Covid restrictions but also managed to get a range of services up and running, covering everything from delivery of homemade lunches to prescriptions pickup and delivery.Since the May  Holyrood elections and the Scottish Government announcement of new ministerial posts, I welcome Humza Yousaf as Scotlandrsquos new Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care.

The Feeley Report asks for a clear distinction between the range of services provided for older people who have a neurological condition such as dementia and others with complex health needs, as the needs of each group are signicantly dferent.Looking to the future, the question is not whether Scotland can afford to implement the Feeley recommendations but put much more simply, we cannot afford not to do so.John MacMillan is CEO of the Eric Liddell Centre"},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-not-late-build-world-class-stem-education-system","story":"A REVIEW of Scotlandrsquos Curriculum for Excellencendash the cornerstone of Scottish education ndashwill be published in June, and should be regarded as a matter of great signicance to the teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics ndash Stem for short.Calls for an independent evaluation of CfE have been years in the making, and the recommendations from the review being carried out by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , will undoubtedly be pored over by policymakers.The Learned Societiesrsquo Group on Scottish Stem Educationsubmitted oral evidence to the OECDrsquos review, drawing together key issues in need of further national action. As we await OECDrsquos final word on the curriculum, we take this opportunity to highlight some of our concerns.CfE began as a promising development, and it is still laudable for its forward-thinking and holistic aims. Itrsquos not too late for these ambitions to be realised and used to build a world-class Stem education system, however we must first recognise the wider context that has hindered its delivery. Even the best-designed Stem curriculum will falter in the face of pervasive and persistent structural challenges.Reforming the senior phase led to a narrowing of subject choice, sowing the initial seeds for a review of CfE and contributing to declines in enrolment in Stem subjects at SCQF levels  and  since .Secondly, Scotland faces shortages of subject-specialist teachers, and secondary school laboratory technicians, both of which are critical to delivering the kind of engrossing Stem experiences which inspire lelong interest in these subjects.More widely, classrooms are having to resort to multi-course teaching ndash the dficult practice of teaching more than one course in the same timeslot ndash to combat the effects of limited staff capacity and timetabling pressures.Finally, primary teachers can lack confidence in teaching Stem an increased focus on Stem subjects in primary teacher education, both initial and career-long, is required to build teachersrsquo knowledge and understanding in these subjects.Among its widespread havoc, Covid- upended many of our traditional approaches to education, from empty classrooms to exam cancellations. Many of these adjustments were profoundly stressful and often had the greatest impact on the most disadvantaged learners. However, they also prompted important questions and challenged longstanding assumptions of what it means to assess learning.As the pandemic and its aftershocks subside, some of these changes may persist and gain further traction. There could be an opportunity to reconfigure assessments to improve their effectiveness and reduce teacher workloads. However, rather than rushing into any large-scale educational upheavals on the back of post-Covid recovery, any lessons learned will need to be sensitively applied, ensuring they bring genuine benefit for teachers, parents, and pupils alike.Stem education in Scotland faces several obstacles. While valuable in its own right, its role in building the next generation of problem-solvers and keeping Scotlandrsquos economy and research sectors internationally competitive cannot be denied.

She tweeted: ldquoThose responsible for the Ryanair hijacking must be sanctioned. Journalist Roman Protasevich must be released immediately.The ersion of a plane owned by an EU company that was flying between two EU capitals and seizure of Protasevich was just the latest foreign policy test for the EU which often talks tough but seems less inclined to follow through with direct action. DAVID PRATT:Europe is once again facing threat from the far rightYes, admittedly, European leaders have already imposed three rounds of sanctions on Belarus and its President Alexander Lukashenko and other regime members following their crackdown on opposition activists in the wake of last yearrsquos presidential polls.That the EU will toughen its position even further is now inevitable evenit remains wary of over-doing things against Minsk for fear of pushing Lukashenko into even closer ties with Russia.The obvious option is to shun Belaruss airspace and ban national carrier Belavia from EU airports. But wider and tighter sanctions remain the key weapon in the EUrsquos arsenal evenas one senior diplomat said, ldquoIts not so easy to calibrate sanctionsyou want to spare the population.But eventougher sanctions are imposed, the inescapable fact is that for some time now, many have viewed EU sanctions as something of a paper tiger. Nowhere more so than perhaps Crimea on which sanctions were imposed in  following Russias invasion of Ukraine.Ostensibly, EU nationals were banned from doing business in Russia-occupied Crimea and those who harmed ldquothe territorial integrity of Ukraine were blacklisted.But as the online newspaper EUobserver highlighted only this week using the case of Greek billionaire, Ivan Savvidi, there are those who make a mockery of EU sanctions on Russia.Mr Savvidi himself is said to be actively engaged in food supplies to Crimea and openly funds pro-Russian occupation propaganda events say analysts who suggest that any comparable sanctions imposed against Belarus will be treated by Minsk with a similar disdain.On the other hand, this weekrsquos events could yet prove a watershed moment for EU foreign policy decisions that require a unanimous agreement by the  member states, something that in the past has often proved elusive.Irelandrsquos Minister of State for European Affairs, Thomas Byrne, noted that he had ldquonever seen such anger across the EU and many firmly believe that anger will now translate into unprecedented action.Certainly, this is the moment says the blocrsquos staunchest supporters when it needs to show it has a foreign policy that works and can be relied upon to be robust and as effective as the ldquosoft policy approach some within the EU appear to favour.The fact that even Hungaryrsquos Prime Minister Viktor Orban, not always known for being an EU team player, has come out in favour of tougher action against fellow authoritarian Mr Lukashenko, suggests that this time the EU might really mean business. Should however Mr Orban pull a U-turn and again use his veto to scupper any collective action this week, fellow EU leaders many will find it hard to forgive him.But itrsquos also worth noting that the situation right now in Belarus is not the only crisis currently testing the mettle of EU foreign policy. Another part of the world is also proving to be the arena in which an important sht in EU foreign and security policy is already underway and not without generating considerable controversy.Recently, in what is undoubtedly a toughening of stance, the European bloc for the first time is now allowed to arm governments in the name of fighting terrorism, protecting civilians, and stabilising fragile states. As the Financial Times reported just a few days ago, the money for this will come from a new eurobn fund over seven years known rather incongruously as the European Peace Facility .The EPF has been described as the most signicant expansion yet in growing EU efforts to project ldquohard power to influence international conflicts particularly in regions close to its borders such as eastern Europe and Africa. A likely focus of the EPF will be in the Sahel region of West Africa in countries like Mali, Chad, and Niger where French and other forces are already engaged in tackling Islamist-inspired terrorism. DAVID PRATT:Benjamin Netanyahu ndash the Harry Houdini of Israeli politicsldquoWe are not going to stop the terrorists from killing people just by preaching, insisted EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell recently.ldquoWe need arms. We need military capacities and that is what we are going to provide, to help our African friends. Because their security is our security, Mr Borrell added.But it goes without saying that many are less than convinced by such policies, pointing to intervention and supplies of arms in the likes of Iraq and Afghanistan as sobering lessons as to what can go wrong.ldquoThere is a growing contradiction in the EUrsquos approach to conflict and crises, says Lucia Montanaro, head of the EU office of Saferworld, a non-governmental group focused on conflicts.ldquoIts strong commitments to promoting human rights, gender equality and arms control are increasingly overshadowed by efforts to boost the combat capability of authoritarian partners, Ms Montanaro was cited by the FT as saying this week expressing the concern of others.On the face of it for an EU rhetorically committed to democracy and human rights it does seem like a signicant sht in foreign policy enactment on the ground. But this is the fluid ever shting geo-political world of which the EU is part and there is simply no escaping.Whether it be an assertive Russia, the threat of jihadism or what was tantamount to an act of ldquoair piracy on a flight between two EU capitals, the EU is rapidly concluding that simply talking about a response is sometimes not enough.David Pratt is Contributing Foreign Editor.

Two members of my family in their early s are still waiting for their first jab and would happily have turned up at the Hydro at short notice over the weekend to receive their first jab. Another family member of a similar age in Edinburgh has been trying to get through to the helpline having not received a letter yet. On one occasion she was th in the queue.How much longer do we have to tolerate this waste of professional time and potential vaccine wastage in Scotland when in other parts of the UK appointments can be booked online and vaccine uptake is much higher Gill Craig, Glasgow.NHS DATABASE IS FAILING USYOUR headline story about roughly half of vaccine appointments being missed at The Hydro in Glasgow may well be linked to the NHS database being out of date in some cases.Im aware of two examples where vaccine letters were sent to people who had been absent from the addresses in question for many years. One of them arrived at my own address recently for a previous occupant, a student who left Glasgow in  tohome to China. I ed it to the sender.The second case is even more extreme. I have a friend in Leipzig who used to live in East Kilbride. He has been living in Germany for more than  years and, since Brexit, is now a German citizen. A letter with a vaccine appointment arrived at his former East Kilbride address recently and was forwarded to him by his sister, who still lives at the property. He attempted to cancel the appointment online but discovered to his consternation that this was not possible. The system would only allow him to reschedule it. He eventually gave up.While I have nothing but praise for the NHS in the attempts to have people vaccinated as quickly as possible, the evidence suggests that they have no administrative mechanism for updating their recordspeople do not contact them with this information. Electoral registration officers actively check current residency on a semi-regular basis. Why can the NHS not do the same Dave Stewart, Glasgow.* I HAVE been unsuccessful in cancelling a Covid- vaccination appointment for my son, who has not resided in the UK for seven years. There appears to be no facility online to cancel, only to reschedule, and after learning I was th in the queue on the vaccination helpline, unsurprisingly I gave up trying.

Yet in Glasgow thousands of people failed to turn up for Covid jag appointments at the SSE Hydro at the weekend, wasting resources and putting themselves and others at continuing risk of catching the disease.Some of the absentees from the jab appointments may have ethical or religious issues to overcome before getting the vaccine, but the huge numbers not turning up would seem to suggest that it went far beyond that, with complacency and hesitancy creeping in. There is less chance of the city being downgraded from Level the population is complacent about Covid, dissuading tourists from visiting the city and impacting on struggling businesses.

Irsquom sure all our thoughts are with the young activist and his girlfriend, as well as the many other iniduals currently incarcerated for trying to counter this contemptible regime.The Westrsquos moral outrage on the matter is seriously undermined, however, by its complicity in the equally shameful abductions of foreign nationals by the United States, often from third countries, and the covert transport of these people to secret locations for interrogation and illegal detention.While in no way legitimising the Belarusian actions, American insistence on extensive extraterritorial jurisdiction and complete immunity from independent oversight over its many breaches of international law provides dictatorial governments such as Alexander Lukashenkorsquos with the opportunity to claim precedents have been set.Indignation expressed by the US, UK and others rings hollow against the background of history.

That is the obstacle to peace.

However, I would make two points.First, the appropriate time for the authorities to have initiated this idea would have been when those of the st who were at the scene were alive. Many, like my father, died believing that their stand had been virtually ignored amidst the regular Dunkirk remembrances.Secondly, while I am hopefully wrong in this concern, I harbour doubts that the underlying reason for the belated recognition of the event is at least in part an effort to promote the Union in the face of the current increase in the cause of Scottish independence.Please do remember those who were there and others who fought against Nazi tyranny, but do it for the right reasons.Archie Hamilton, Glasgow.Read more: Half of Glasgow Hydro vaccine appointments were no shows over weekend"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/3129190.jpg?type=article-full","title":"cummings-chicken-pox-style-parties-considered-method-creating-herd-immunity-covid","story":"Dominic Cummings, the Prime Ministers former senior aide, made the claim during an evidence session of theScience and Technology Committee and Health and Social Care Committee this morning.He claimed that Mark Sedwill, former head of the Civil Service and Cabinet Secretary until June last year,suggested telling people they should hold old-fashioned \"chicken pox parties\" to generate herd immunity against coronavirus.He said Mr Sedwill wanted Boris Johnson to go on television and tell people to hold covid-spreading parties, explaining:\"The Cabinet Secretary said Prime Minister, you should go on TV tomorrow and explain to people the herd immunity plan, and that its like the old chicken pox parties.

The kilt is made from one eight-yard stretch of material and the skill is chalking it so you know exactly where to put the pleats. The whole thing takes a skilled person about eight hours at least.The problem ndash and itrsquos the same with sporrans ndash is there are lots of cheap imports around, which has put the traditional craft under pressure. Kilt making by hand has now been added to the endangered list kept by the Heritage Crafts Association along with the likes of arrowsmithing, flintknapping, and lorinery. What it means is these wonderful traditions could disappear altogether.In some ways though, it does seem strange that the threat to traditional kilt-making should come up now. The kilt has never been so ubiquitous, but maybe a lot of men think the lighter, cheaper kilt is easier to wear and lug about. The cost of a hand-made kilt can also be daunting ndash these days, you can easily pay more than pound,.The other problem with kilts is that,you do get one, it comes with a lot of baggage and attitude, some of which is a load of rubbish. For many, the kilt is the standardised vision of Scotland, but they werenrsquot always so common. My parents married in the s and it didnrsquot even cross my fatherrsquos mind to wear a kilt. I also spoke to the historian Patrick Watt about tartan and his experience was similar. Dr Watt, who was curator of modern history at the National Museum of Scotland, told me his dad did wear a kilt at his wedding in  but people asked what he was doing. ldquoLots of people wear kilts now, he said, ldquobut itrsquos a recent thing ndash in the last  years.No doubt, some of this recent enthusiasm for kilts has something to do with the recent enthusiasm for independence, the idea being that kilts are a link to national identity, rebellion or a form of modern-day Jacobitism. But all Irsquod say to that is: check your history. It may not be true, as some people think, that Highland dress was invented by Walter Scott, but the modern romantic image was popularised and spread by Queen Victoria. And check out this fact: at Culloden, there were kilted solders on both sides.The idea of clan tartans, which is also associated with kilts, is a modern obsession too, and an irritating one. Traditionally, people mixed and matched tartans, but now therersquos an idea that you should wear your clan tartan and,you donrsquot, a bumptious bore will tell you why you should. But why does the kilt have to be associated with ldquorules and cultural snobbery  Better to do your own thing .Finally, therersquos one other thing we should talk about, and itrsquos an issue most men are reluctant to discuss: sex and gender. I was at a ceilidh a while ago and the subject of men dressing ldquoas women came up, with most of the guys saying they were uncomfortable with the idea. I pointed out they were expressing this opinion while wearing skirts, to which their response was ldquothese arenrsquot skirts, these are kilts!That says it all, doesnrsquot it  We live in a society that says certain clothes are for women and certain clothes are for men many men also believe skirts are ldquowrong and kilts are ldquoright.

I specically remember at a lesson in early January  when the first outbreak happened and we were discussing it in class.ldquoI was explaining to my pupils that there was an area called Wuhan in China, this is happening there, and linking it to what I teach.ldquoWe spoke aboutyou were Prime Minister oryou were a government adviser, what steps would you be doing to develop these critical thinking skills.She continued: ldquoMy -year-old weans understood the concept of closing the borders, of stopping people from entering the country.ldquoIf -year-old kids could understand that, why... is that a fair assessment then to say that the government... that -year-old kids were thinking more about it that the government Mr Cummings replied ldquoCorrect, yes.He said that there were concerns from government that it could be perceived as racist to stop travellers from certain countries coming to the UK, and in a swipe at the Prime Minister added: ldquoFundamentally, there was no proper border policy because the Prime Minister never wanted a proper border policy.He added: ldquoRepeatedly in meeting after meeting, I and others said lsquoAll we have to do is download the Singapore or Taiwan documents in English and impose them here.rsquoldquoWere imposing all of these restrictions on people domestically, but people can see that everyones just coming in from these countries. Its madness, its undermining the whole message that we should take this seriously.ldquoHis basic argument at that pointhelliphe was back to lsquoLockdown was all terrible mistake.rsquoAt an earlier point in the committee, Mr Cummings also told MPs about the Prime Minister being \"stupid to pick a fight\"with footballer Marcus Rashford over the free school meals fiasco.Boris Johnsonrsquos former chief adviser claimed that the Prime Minister was told twice by the director of communications not to take on the striker over his campaign to tackle child food poverty.The Manchester United starrsquos campaign to extend free school meal vouchers for eligible pupils into the summer holidays, amid the coronavirus pandemic, led to a Government U-turn in June last year.The Government made a U-turn again in November after Rashford and child poverty campaigners called for free school meals to be provided to disadvantaged children during the Christmas holidays as well.Pointing to the row, Mr Cummings said: ldquoFor example, the whole thing with Rashford, the director of communications said to the Prime Minister twice, lsquodo not pick a fight with Rashford. Obviously, we should do this insteadrsquo.ldquoThe Prime Minister decided to pick a fight and then surrendered twice.ldquoAfter that everyone says lsquooh, your communications is stupidrsquo. No, whatrsquos stupid was picking a fight with Rashford over school meals, and what should have happened is just getting the school meals policy right.ldquoSo itrsquos easy to blame communications for bad policy and bad decision-making.When asked to score the Government from  to  on its communication with the public and the NHS, Mr Cummings said ldquoone of the great myths was that all the problems from the pandemic were due to ldquobad communications.He said: ldquoFundamentally, the reason for all these problems was bad policy, bad decisions, bad planning, bad operational capability.ldquoIt doesnrsquot matteryoursquove got great people doing communications,the Prime Minister changes his mind  times a day, and then calls up the media and contradicts his own policy day after day after day, yoursquore going to have a communications disaster zone."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-lockdown-delay-blame-lies-london-not-edinburgh","story":"First, is he unaware that until the end of March  the devolved governments did not have the powers to declare a lockdown  The lockdown in Scotland on March  may have been too late, but the powers to do so lay at Westminster at that time.Secondly, I can scarcely believe that Mr Macwhirter is unaware that a lockdown without furlough ndash or some other method of maintaining incomes ndash is impossible without the economy going into meltdown, as well as widespread social disorder.

Why not go the full Monty and insist that he is an Eton-educated promiscuous cad  Nothing is offered in support of his contention that Nicola Sturgeon would be better placed to champion ecological values.Complaining about diatribes delivered against Ms Sturgeon is rich. The language of political exchange adopted by the SNP is all too frequently abusive, with a particular animus directed against Mr Johnson. Day after relentless day disparaging ad hominem abusive attacks are delivered against him. Ian Blackford deploys ridicule in his verbose assaults. The SNPrsquos electronic bard Pete Wishart is similarly engaged in the juvenile pursuit of Mr Johnson with his repeated jibe that he is \"a clown in clownrsquos shoes\".Comparisons of Mr Johnson with Churchill are all too frequently overblown but one common characteristic is a shared determination to employ robust argument without denigrating their opponents. Both remainedadmirably resilient in the face of seemingly endless and tedious personal invective.Would it be facile to argue at this time of post-Covid reconstruction that a moderation of political invective is a necessary and sufficient condition for engendering that cooperation which all parties have declared is essential for economic and psychological recovery Cleansing of the ecological environment could benefit from an accompanying cleansing of the personalised language all too frequently in evidence in the current political environment.

A key witness eager to unburden himself and point the finger on an issue with the highest possible stakes. We will not see its like again for some time, I bet.Parliamentary committees, whether examining government departments or poring over legislation, are rarely so compelling. Especially at Holyrood.One of the interesting dferences between yesterdayrsquos session and the typical Scottish Parliament offering was who was in charge.:Cummings paints surreal picture of goings-on at dysal Number  ndash Westminster sketchOpening the questions and setting the tone of blunt inquiry was Greg Clark, a minister from the outset of the Toriesto power in , who held two cabinet posts and is now chair of the Commons science and technology select committee.The other lead inquisitor was Jeremy Hunt, a three-time cabinet secretary from  to  who now chairs the health and social care committee.It is not unusual for former big beasts to chair select committees, posts that are not only elected by MPs, conferring authority, but are remunerated at pound, a year, so the occupants have to earn their keep.It helps maintain the tradition of independent-minded scrutiny, even by MPs of the governing party.The experience former ministers bring to the job is also invaluable as they know best how the system works and how best to penetrate the wiles and evasions of officialdom.Both Mr Clark and Mr Hunt are Tories perfectly willing to make le hard for a Tory Prime Minister.Yes, both were Remainers ousted in Boris Johnsonrsquos first reshuffle, so there may be personal factors at play, but they are still part of a healthier-than-Holyrood system where loyalty to onersquos party is not paramount.Meanwhile in Edinburgh, it is rare for recent ministers to be committee conveners, and rarer still for former cabinet secretaries to take on the role.In the - Scottish parliament, there were only three former SNP ministers who led committees, and only two in the - session, when one former cabinet secretary also fleetingly took charge of a committee for two recess months one year.In Westminster, committee chair is a perfectly respectable afterle for a former minister or cabinet secretary, with remuneration offering lsquojam todayrsquo to make up for the workload.Holyrood is quite dferent. Conveners are not elected by the parliament as a whole, but by the MSPs on each committee.:Battle royal looms as William and Kate deployed to bolster the UnionWith parties choosing which MSPs go where, it gives the government of the day a huge say in who gets many of the gigs, and naturally it has no wish to implant thorns in its own side.Convenerships are very often the stepping stones to ministerial office.There is no remuneration for the considerable amount of extra graft.Instead, there is the lure of lsquojam tomorrowrsquo in the form of promotion.That incentivises loyalty to the government and not causing a fuss.Other MSPs of the governing party follow this example. Mavericks, such as Alex Neil, are welcome but rare.Holyroodrsquos committee system was famously supposed to be the jewel in its crown, offering the scrutiny of a second chamber without the cost.But as we enter a sixth parliamentary term, its clear theyrsquove been a let-down, arguably reaching their nadir in the gutless toadying from some SNP MSPs during the Alex Salmond inquiry.Some problems come down to the parliamentrsquos size. The talent pool is more paddling than ing.Even with the SNP having close to a majority, around a fth of all MSPs are part of the government, and so unavailable for committee duty.Infrequent reshuffles mean a low turnover in ministers, so government experience is lacking among the rest.The present First Ministerrsquos habit of re-hiring old hands also leaves former ministers who are on committees wonderingthey might one day , so best to bite their tongue.There have been many tinkering attempts at reform. In , then Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick asked the Standards Committee to investigate the case for elected conveners, an idea she supported.ldquoIf conveners were elected by the whole Parliament, they would derive their authority and mandate from the Parliament itself, she said.ldquoThis sht of responsibility... would strengthen the role of the Parliament and so enhance the sharing of power between the government, the Parliament and the people.The Committee preferred fudge, concluding the Parliament ldquoshould set aside the idea on elected conveners and discuss general scrutiny instead.The next PO, Ken Macintosh, tried again, establishing an independent commission on parliamentary reform to help improve scrutiny.It backed elected conveners, with procedures in place from the start of the current session, with potential remuneration based on workload.The committees have yet to be formed for this session, but there is no sign yet of any elections or pay bumps.Instead, it looks like the same old patronage and pusillanimity.Nicola Sturgeon yesterday promised ldquounashamedly ambitious policies for the coming term, while priding herself on Holyrood not transplanting ldquothe old ways of Westminster.But grand plans merit deep scrutiny and Holyrood doesnrsquot offer it.ldquoWe do not claim a monopoly of wisdom, the First Minister added.In that case,some Westminster ways are worth importing, do it."},{"url":null,"title":"catherine-heymans-named-first-female-astronomer-royal-scotland","story":"Catherine Heymans, a world-leading expert on the physics of the so-called dark universe, has been awarded the almost -year-old title.The astrophysicist was recommended to the Queen for the role by an international , convened by the Royal Society of Edinburgh.Prof Heymans said: ldquoI donrsquot think anyone forgets the first time they saw the rings of Saturn through a telescope, but too many people never have the chance.ldquoAs Astronomer Royal for Scotland, I want to change that.ldquoMy hope is that once that spark and connection with the universe is made, children will carry that excitement home with them and develop a le-long passion for astronomy or, even better, science as a whole.ldquoI am absolutely delighted to be named Astronomer Royal for Scotland and as an advocate for equality and ersity, it is also a great honour to be the first woman appointed to the role.ldquoI will enthusiastically use this high-profile  to advance amateur and professional astronomy within Scotland and to promote Scotland internationally as a world-leading centre for science.Prof Heymans is professor of astrophysics at the University of Edinburgh and director of the German Centre for Cosmological Lensing at Ruhr-University Bochum.Her research seeks to shed light on the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter ndash entities that together account for more than % of the universe.Created in , the position of Astronomer Royal for Scotland was originally held by the director of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh.Since  it has been awarded as an honorary title.The previous holder, John Brown, died in .As the th Astronomer Royal, Prof Heymansrsquos main focus will be on sharing her passion for astronomy with Scots from all walks of le.One of her first targets is to install telescopes at all of Scotlandrsquos remote outdoor learning centres, which are visited by most of the countryrsquos school pupils."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmThis week’s edition of The Orcadian is now in shops and is available online, here.

We seek assurances, therefore, that  steps will be taken to ensure that this happens. Close collaboration with locally elected representatives, including the island authorities, will be important but we would encourage you and your officials to look at other ways of making sure this happens from the outset.“Needless to say, we would be happy to meet with you to discuss this matter in more detail.  Meantime, we wish you well in the substantial task that lies ahead and stand ready to assist, particularly in ensuring the needs of our islands are front and centre of government thinking.“We look forward to hearing from you in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

should have been fired for his disastrous performance in the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Hancock did not comment on former No  aide Mr Cummingsrsquo explosive claims ahead of his Commons appearance and Downing Street press conference, saying he was ldquojust off to drive forward the vaccine programme as he left his north-west London home.Cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick said he was sorry for the Governmentrsquos ldquoerrors and mistakes during the pandemic but insisted Mr Hancock and his department had worked ldquoincredibly hard during the crisis.The fallout continued from Mr Cummingsrsquo seven-hour evidence session to MPs, during which he claimed his former boss Boris Johnson was ldquounfit to lead and his Governmentrsquos failures had led to tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths.Apart from his damning assessment of the Prime Minister, Mr Cummings saved his fiercest criticism for Mr Hancock over failings around care homes policy, personal protective equipmentprocurement and his public pledge on a testing target which caused disruption in Whitehall.Communities Secretary Mr Jenrick told Sky News: ldquoI think the Department for Health and the Health Secretary have worked exceptionally hard over the course of this pandemic.ldquoThis was an unprecedented situation, it was a national effort involving all parts of Government in all parts of the country.Asked whether he thought Mr Hancock had lied on multiple occasions, as Mr Cummings alleged, Mr Jenrick said: ldquoThatrsquos not my experience.But he admitted ldquothere were things we, with the benefit of hindsight, could have done better to protect people in care homes.Mr Cummings blamed Mr Hancock, telling MPs on Wednesday that the Prime Minister had been told ldquocategorically in March that people will be tested before they went back to care homes from hospital.It was ldquocomplete nonsense to claim the Government had put a shield around care homes, Mr Cummings claimed, but Mr Jenrick insisted ldquoitrsquos not correct to say that we didnrsquot do everything we possibly could to protect both the residents and the people who work in care homes, with the imperfect information we had available to us at the time.Responding to Mr Cummingsrsquo assessment that the pandemic demonstrated a country of ldquolions led by donkeys, Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: ldquoWell I donrsquot think thatrsquos a fair assessment of what happened.He added: ldquoI think the Prime Minister led the country through this with huge determination and resilience.ldquoHe himself almost died of Covid at one point, bounced back, got back into running the country incredibly quickly.Mr Jenrick rejected the claim that ldquotens of thousands of people died unnecessarily during the crisis.Asked directly whether he thinks that claim is wrong, he told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoYes, I think it is, because you have to remember that we didnrsquot have all of the facts at the time that the decisions were being taken.ldquoNobody, I think, could doubt for one moment that the Prime Minister was doing anything other than acting with the best of motives with the information and the advice that was available to him.Mr Jenrick refused to say whether or not Mr Cummings was a reliable source of information about the Governmentrsquos handling of the pandemic. vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings giving evidence ldquoHersquos now left government, and you heard him give his side of events, which he is completely at liberty to do, Mr Jenrick said.Mr Cummings said Mr Hancock should have been sacked on  to  occasions and Whitehallrsquos top mandarin at the time Sir Mark Sedwill had ldquolost confidence in the Secretary of Statersquos honesty.A spokesman for Mr Hancock said ldquowe absolutely reject the criticisms made by Mr Cummings.Downing Street said on Wednesday Mr Hancock continued to have the confidence of the Prime Minister and the pair were ldquoworking closely to save lives.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is likely to face questions of his own about the explosive evidence from his once-closest aide when he visits a hospital on Thursday.As well as being branded unfit for office, it was alleged Mr Johnson dismissed the pandemic as a ldquoscare story or the new ldquoswine flu in early  as the global crisis loomed and wanted to be injected with Covid- on television in a bid to calm the nation.Mr Cummings, who was ousted from No  late last year as part of a behind-the-scenes power struggle, said that, by the end of October , his relationship with Mr Johnson had deteriorated due to the Prime Ministerrsquos delays to ordering an autumn lockdown that could have prevented deaths. vw,vw,px, px\"The Prime Minister was criticised as lsquounfitrsquo for the job by his former aide Dominic Cummings He said that he ldquofundamentally regarded him as unfit for the joband that he was attempting to make changes to the ldquostructure around him to try and stop what I thought were extremely bad decisions.Offering his version of events of the outset of the pandemic in Britain, Mr Cummings described his mounting panic about the situation in March .The -year-old said there was no plan in place for a lockdown or measures to protect the most vulnerable and quoted deputy cabinet secretary Helen MacNamara who, he claimed, told him she thought the country was ldquoabsolutely f***** and that ldquowersquore going to kill thousands of people.The first lockdown was finally implemented on March , but Mr Cummings said the Prime Minister later regretted the move.Similar mistakes were made in September as Mr Johnson was urged by Government scientists to impose a second lockdown but he resisted because of economic concerns, instead opting to ldquohit and hope.Askedhe had heard Mr Johnson say he would rather see ldquobodies pile high than impose a third lockdown on the nation, Mr Cummings said: ldquoI heard that in the Prime Ministerrsquos study, describing BBC reporting of the incident as ldquoaccurate.copy -.

If they want to concentrate these during the summer holidays, then we might have to look for an alternative location for the showthere is too much work going on at the site.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3818565.jpg--.jpg?1621931825000\n","title":"david gourley devoted student of ww1 history","story":"Randalstown man David Gourley, who passed away earlier this month, will be remembered as a devoted student of World War One history and a champion of all those who served in that terrible conflict from across the political and religious ide.

Credit: William Cherry PresseyeMargaret CanningTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailBusinesses from coach firms to bakeries which were open during the latest lockdown but still lost out on trade are to benefit from over £m in support.The Department of Finance announced it will start issuing top-up grants of £, or £, today.The funds are being distributed to support enterprises which suffered from a lack of footfall as a result of the restrictions during the latest shutdown, which began on Boxing Day.Even though eligible firms were open to customers, they still lost out on trade because the businesses around them were closed, and because there were fewer customers in circulation.More than , businesses are receiving the top-up grants. Over , businesses will receive a £, top up while over , businesses will receive a £, top-up.They are being made to firms which received grants of £, or £, at the outset of the pandemic but did not get support from the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme, which gave grants to firms which had to shut in the lockdown.Finance Minister Conor Murphy visited two businesses which will receive the top-up grants –delicatessen Sawers in Belfast city centre and a Centra convenience store in the city#s Cathedral Quarter.Sawers managing director Kieran Sloan described days over lockdown where not a single customer visited his shop as people abided by government advice to stay at home to stem the spread of the virus.By sharp contrast the city was bustling yesterday afternoon as he welcomed Mr Murphy through his doors.The minister was shown the shop#s array of produce, including caviar, pizza making ingredients which became more popular over lockdown and some hot sauces which have also increased in popularity thanks to online challenges.Mr Sloan described how his long established business had to adapt to the pandemic, with more deliveries and increasing its online presence.We had to change,you didn#t change, you died and that was it, he said.Footfall dropped by nearly %, we had no-one in town. There were days when we did not have one customer in. I was standing in there by myself, we had no staff, they were all on furlough. It was frightening.Footfall then came back, because we are a destination shop, people began to come to us.But it was great on Monday to see everyone open again.It#s not back to normal but it#s great to see people around and Saturdays are coming back to the old Saturdays again.Mr Murphy also visited Donagh McGoveran#s Centra shop in the Cathedral Quarter. The shop saw sales drop by %.It was a signicant jolt to the business, he said.Mr McGoveran opened the business during a time of buzz in the Cathedral Quarter with the extension of the nearby Ulster University campus and more student accommodation being built.It had a transformational effect on this part of the city so the pandemic was a devastating blow for all the shops in the area, he said.We got a bit of an increase in footfall in September last year when things started to open up, but then we went back into full lockdown later in the year and things really didn#t start to recover until the last week or so, we#ve seen a bit of a buzz about the city centre.Hospitality opening up has really helped us in terms of people coming into the city centre.Mr Murphy said he recognised that stores’ trade and footfall was impacted as a result of the restrictions – whenthey could remain open.“I have been determined throughout the pandemic to ensure support reaches as many businesses as possible,” he said.These top up payments will benefit thousands of small and medium sized businesses across retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure and manufacturing which were unable to access Executive business support schemes.This grant will cover a wider range of business including convenience stores, hardware stores, bakeries, financial services, engineering firms, and coach services to name a few.”The department said that Land  Property Services will be carrying out verication work to make sure the properties are still occupied by the same owners who received the original grant.And those which firms only started trading after the deadlines for the £K small business support grant and the £K retail, tourism, hospitality and leisure grant had closed can apply online for the top-up from late June, the department said.Mr Murphy said the reopening of businesses this week was a positive step forward for the economy but that it would take time for trading toto pre-pandemic levels.Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said: “Retail NI is pleased that the Finance Minister and his department have listened to our views and concerns and responded with this grant scheme.”Most ReadTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseHe will kill next child, warns niece of paedophile Billy Adams raped at age of eightShot teen’s family’s tears of joy as UVF man Alan Oliver found liable for deathTop VideosPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Cute kids swearing like sailors in this Smart Car advert is uncomfortably funny - Warning Strong LanguageLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCovid vaccination programme opens to everyone in Northern IrelandDodds launches ‘ambitious’ skills plan to boost innovation and grow economy NI medical chief will not be drawn on Cummings’ attackLatestStuart Dallas will get chance to captain Northern Ireland as boss hails Leeds United ‘leader’Coronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adults‘Zero entertainment’: Neil Lennon slams Manchester United after Europa League final defeat to VillarrealHancock to face MPs over Cummings’ explosive claims he lied over coronavirusHSBC pulls out of US retail banking market,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year.

Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Most ReadTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseHe will kill next child, warns niece of paedophile Billy Adams raped at age of eightShot teen’s family’s tears of joy as UVF man Alan Oliver found liable for deathTop VideosPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Cute kids swearing like sailors in this Smart Car advert is uncomfortably funny -

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Most ReadTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseHe will kill next child, warns niece of paedophile Billy Adams raped at age of eightShot teen’s family’s tears of joy as UVF man Alan Oliver found liable for deathTop VideosPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Cute kids swearing like sailors in this Smart Car advert is uncomfortably funny - Warning Strong LanguageLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCovid vaccination programme opens to everyone in Northern Ireland£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownDodds launches ‘ambitious’ skills plan to boost innovation and grow economy LatestCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adults‘Zero entertainment’: Neil Lennon slams Manchester United after Europa League final defeat to VillarrealNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleKearney savouring his new le Down UnderBlues will be ready to go again, vows Healy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsMoreNewslettersCompetitionsHome DeliveryePaper editionBelfastPension SchemeSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsBelfastPension SchemeA MediahuisWebsitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty Didomi.preferences\" href\"#\" style\"cursor: pointer position: fixed background:padding: px px color: #ffffff display: flex align-items: center max-height: px z-index:  bottom: px right: px border-top-left-radius: px border-top-right-radius: px\" Privacy"},{"url":null,"title":"end common travel area confusion now stormont is urged","story":"Tourist chief warns MLAs Executive’s rules on moving within zone vague and is costing the industry dearExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Joanne Stuart. Credit: John Harrison FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDr Joanne Stuart. Credit: John HarrisonGillian HallidayTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailConfusion over the Executive#s rules around moving within the Common Travel Areahas already resulted in cancellations for the hospitality sector, it has been revealed.Dr Joanne Stuart, chief executive of the NI Tourism Alliance, called for the Executive to remove the regulations due to uncertainty amongst the hospitality sector and travellers.Speaking at Stormont’s economy committee yesterday, she said the latest guidance had created a completely confusing picture.I#m engaging with all of my members and the amount of queries coming in on the back of that travel advice and the number of cancellations that are being made, she said.From our perspective, we haven’t run a GB campaign as yet, and the earliest we are going to be able to do that would be mid to late June.”Travel within the CTA — the UK, Republic, Isle of Man and Channel Islands — has been permitted by the Executive since Monday.The Executive has stipulated that anyone planning to come to Northern Ireland from Britain and stay for more than  hours should self-isolate on arrival for  days.The Department of Health has stressed the guidance is necessary as Covid “still presents a very real threat, as does new iants of the virus”.There are a series of exemptions to the guidance, which is not law, and those travelling to visit friends and family are not required to self-isolate.However, people who are not required to self-isolate are advised to take a lateral flow Covid test prior to travelling here, and again following their arrival.Arriving here, or travelling from here to another part of the CTA for a holiday or a hotel stay, is not covered in the exemptions, leading to confusion.Non-essential travel has been given the go-ahead between England, Wales and Scotland .The tourist chief said the issue required urgent clarication from the Executive, and she said she hopes the matter would be discussed when ministers meet today.It#s not very clear that it#s about personal responsibility, it#s about you understanding your own circumstances, and also the way that people think they have to pay for tests,” Dr Stuart explained.She stressed further clarity around the reasons for the guidance was needed, adding that visitors from Britain make up % of our tourism market.If there are real concerns, from a health perspective, then it should be much clearer,” she insisted.She said that some were struggling to understand the rationale behind the guidance, given that many people would find themselves in more intimate environments thanthey were tourists.She added: We#re very clear. The amount of investment that has been made by people coming visiting and going to places and having experiences... it#s in a very safe environment.We’re doing everything to mitigate transmission .We would love to see it lted for anyone travelling in the CTA without the need for any testing and self-isolation.Another issue facing hospitality, she added, was the need for further financial support given businesses have taken on a “huge burden of debt over the past  months” and the fact that many owners are operating at reduced capacity.Committee member Stewart Dickson told her that Health Minister Robin Swann was currently exploring the idea of introducing printed “secure” vaccination certicates. She responded that the sector would prefer a digital vaccination certication system. Dr Stuart said a digital form would be “much easier” for the industry as a whole, especially for international travel.The Department of Health said rules are reviewed and it is “imperative the travel regulations are adhered to”, adding decisions are based on the “current data on iants of concern”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseHe will kill next child, warns niece of paedophile Billy Adams raped at age of eightShot teen’s family’s tears of joy as UVF man Alan Oliver found liable for deathTop VideosPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayFrom Jeff Goldblum to Spider-Man: The most bizarre moments from Cummings# evidencePlayVideo: Cute kids swearing like sailors in this Smart Car advert is uncomfortably funny - Warning Strong LanguageLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsCovid vaccination programme opens to everyone in Northern IrelandCovid vaccine booking opens for over-s in Northern IrelandSailor with one arm who crossed Atlantic solo plans another epic tripThe Fermanagh gambler who took bookies to the cleanersLatestStuart Dallas will get chance to captain Northern Ireland as boss hails Leeds United ‘leader’Coronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adults‘Zero entertainment’: Neil Lennon slams Manchester United after Europa League final defeat to VillarrealDirector and photographer Eva Sereny dies aged Hancock to face MPs over Cummings’ explosive claims he lied over coronavirus,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He will formally take over on Thursday evening.Mrs Foster has stayed largely silent on the circumstances that led to her departure last month, but told reporters on a visit to east Belfast this week that she had not seen the no confidence letter, describing it as so-called.And on Wednesday night a statement posted on the DUP Fermanagh and South Tyrone page said they would continue to “stand firm by her side”.“Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP Association met this week to voice their disgust at the manner in which our party leader, First Minister and local MLA RT Hon Arlene Foster has been treated over recent weeks,” it said.“Arlene has worked tirelessly over the years not just for Fermanagh and South Tyrone but right across Northern Ireland — helping all constituencies.“Our Association is sending out a strong message to Arlene Foster. This was not done in our name.“The Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP association have unanimously backed Arlene Foster to remain as our MLA, however we recognise this is a personal decision.“We appreciate that Arlene has sacriced so much personally over the years for public service, but this Association will stand firm by her side.”The DUP was contacted for comment.Earlier, Mrs Dodds, appearing at the launch of the X skills strategy in Belfast, was askedthe party’s image had been damaged by the nature of Mrs Foster’s removal.She said: “I’m always saddened by ision.I think that we will secure the Union by securing the largest number of pro-Union voters, who will be at our side and who will vote for us.“So, ision is sad, and I think that the party needs a little bit of time to heal itself and get on with the job, which is, for the Economy Department, of making Northern Ireland an amazing place to live, to work, to do business.”With a new appointment to her ministerial job now likely, Mrs Dodds won’t get to oversee full implementation of her plans to improve the economy.But she insisted she would not carry too many regrets.“Every new leader has the right to bring in the team that they want,” she said.Mrs Dodds was askedshe now fully supported the new leader.She replied: “The democratic process has had its outcome and that’s where we are and we need to now get on ahead making Northern Ireland the best place that we can make it and creating the opportunities that we can.”Mr Poots# election is set to be ratied by the party#s ruling council on Thursday night, a day before Mrs Foster officially steps down as leader.She will remain in post as First Minister until the end of June.Earlier this week Mrs Foster said she had not had the opportunity to speak to Mr Poots yet, adding she did not feel under pressure to step down as First Minister earlier than planned..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseHe will kill next child, warns niece of paedophile Billy Adams raped at age of eightShot teen’s family’s tears of joy as UVF man Alan Oliver found liable for deathTop VideosPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlayVideo: Cute kids swearing like sailors in this Smart Car advert is uncomfortably funny - Warning Strong LanguageLatest Northern IrelandCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsCovid vaccination programme opens to everyone in Northern IrelandCovid vaccine booking opens for over-s in Northern IrelandSailor with one arm who crossed Atlantic solo plans another epic tripThe Fermanagh gambler who took bookies to the cleanersLatestCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adults‘Zero entertainment’: Neil Lennon slams Manchester United after Europa League final defeat to VillarrealNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleKearney savouring his new le Down UnderBlues will be ready to go again, vows Healy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsMoreNewslettersCompetitionsHome DeliveryePaper editionBelfastPension SchemeSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsBelfastPension SchemeA MediahuisWebsitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty Didomi.preferences\" href\"#\" style\"cursor: pointer position: fixed background:padding: px px color: #ffffff display: flex align-items: center max-height: px z-index:  bottom: px right: px border-top-left-radius: px border-top-right-radius: px\" Privacy"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed nis most popular baby names in","story":"Northern Ireland#s most popular baby names for  have been revealed.

The coup, which cleaned out bookies in Ireland and England, was simple but brilliantly conceived and executed.Curley had noted that there was only one public telephone at the racetrack at Bellewstown in the heart of rural Ireland. There was also a private line, but mysteriously it was out of action that day, presumed to have been cut. In tandem with the Belfast bookie Sean Graham, Curley had organised a small army of associates to bet anything from £ to £ in bookie shops around Ireland and England on his “slow but steady” horse Yellow Sam, running in the .pm Mount Hanover Amateur Handicap hurdle that Wednesday. But crucially he had to prevent news of the gamble getting to the course in order to keep the odds at  .Five minutes before the bets were laid, Benny O’Hanlon, an associate of Curley’s, wedged himself into the only working telephone box at the course and refused to budge, preventing news of the money piling on the horse being relayed to the on-course bookies. So Yellow Sam, a rank outsider with jockey Michael Furlong on board, passed the winning post well ahead of the rest of the field. Curley made an estimated £, on that single race.“We paid out like men,” said the Dublin bookie Terry Rodgers, ruefully. “But what annoyed me later on was the revelation that Curley and Graham had been in cahoots, which is a bit rich for a guy who is always going on about bookies rigging the market. It’s fortunate for Barney that he trained as a theologian, because he can justy everything he does to his Jesuitical conscience.”Curley then bought Middleton Park, a stately home on nearly  acres on the shores of Lough Ennell, in Co Westmeath. It was originally the ancestral home of Sir Cecil Boyd-Rochford, horse trainer to British royalty. At the foot of the great staircase he told me in  that his main reasons for disposing of the mansion was because the Irish telephone system was so unreliable, he didn’t know who might be listening in on the line as he planned his secretive gambling exploits.But instead of selling the estate he raffled it. With an elaborate brochure, a video featuring racing and GAA commentator, Michael O’Hehir and appearances on RTE’s Late Late Show and other media he grossed an estimated £.m selling , tickets at £ each. But when gardai raided the house the week before the draw, they came away with just one ticket, leaving Curley with a warning that what he was doing was illegal.With the draw due to take place at pm on Thursday, February , , in a nearby hotel, Curley surmised that the gardai might seize the tickets before the winner could be picked. In a pre-emptive strike at am that morning, as several gardai arrived following a front page story in the Evening Herald, O’Hehir hastily drew the winning ticket bearing the name of Tony Ray.Curley and O’Hehir were arrested and appeared before Judge William Tormey at Ballynacargy District Court, charged with running an illegal lottery. O’Hehir was cleared as his was a “professional” assignment. The judge, a racing man himself, convicted Curley of a “blatant and illegal” breach of the Lotteries Act and dramatically sentenced him to three months in prison.On appeal just days later, he was given the Probation Acthe agreed to donate £, to St Vincent de Paul. Curley wrote a cheque for £, and walked out a free man with an estimated £m in his back pocket, for a house that was sold some years later for £,.Bernard Joseph Curley, who died last Sunday of cancer at his home in Newmarket, England at the age of , was born in Irvinestown, Co Fermanagh. His parents were Catholic, but his father, a shopkeeper, was an “enthusiastic” gambler and drinker who often left the family in dire financial straits.Curley was educated at the Jesuit seminary of Mungret College, Limerick but left after falling ill with TB shortly before he was due to be ordained.“People were dying all around me like flies,” he said later. “There was not much to be scared about after that.”In his autobiography Giving a Little Back, he said he never held down a regular job. He ran a pub, went bust as a bookie, and then became a showband manager with Frankie McBride and the Polka Dots, getting them into the British charts in  with the slushy ballad, Five Little Fingers.At a gig in Killarney, he was introduced to Maureen Curley from St Helen’s in Lancashire, England and when they married, he estimated that given there were so few Curleys in the world their union was a  million to one shot.But it wasn’t all big paydays. He recalled nursing losses of £, after betting against Vincent O’Brien’s Golden Fleece, favourite for the  Epsom Derby. “My judgment just misfired completely,” he wrote. “A lesser man might have been persuaded to pack it in immediately, but I never panicked and I didn’t allow it to get to me. I took Maureen and the kidsto Calornia and effectively retired for three months.”After the Middleton Park raffle, he moved to Newmarket and took out a trainer’s licence.

End to end swashbuckling football that turns the stomach inside out. Slaughtneils shoot-out with Kilcar in Omagh a few seasons back. Derrys win over Dublin in the  All-Ireland semi-final. Armagh and Kerrys blockbuster in the  All-Ireland Final are some that instantly jump onto this page. But championship is about so much more. It is about character and pulling a result from somewhere, like a rabbit from a hat. I think about Dungivens Ulster winning team of . Their performance against Errigal Ciaran that day in Clones was brilliant. It was a convincing win, but they nearly didnt get out of the first round of the championship in Derry that year. googletag.cmd.push In two nerve-tangling encounters at Drumsurn, they escaped from Glenullins clutches on the seat of their pants. Ruairi Boylans - nearly toppled them in the drawn game, before coming through by a point in a replay, their lowest winning margin of the season, second only to a two-point Ulster semi-final over St Pauls of Belfast. There are many others down the years, but when I think about the term championship team those two games in Drumsurn rush to the forefront of my mind. A team finding a way to win, Glenullin dying with their boots on. Chatting to Mark Lynch for a piece on Derrys encounters with Longford got me thinking. Are Derry really a qualier team  googletag.cmd.push More often than not, it was a sorry story from the house of pain. Before the qualiers began in , Derry were on the wrong end of two massive refereeing decisions. Henry Downeys perfectly time shoulder charge on Paddy McKeever yielded a free in as their Ulster semi-final with Armagh sat in the mixer, with the Orchard County going on to win the first of two Ulster titles. Then,  months later, they got another soft free – with BBC commentator and former Armagh legend Jimmy Smyth admitting as much on commentary – to go ahead before Anthony missed a chance to level the game from a free well outside the .     Sting through the championship records, I start to wonder how the mental scars couldve affected the county as a whole. Derrys runs to the All-Ireland Qualiers yielded the  tilt at Sam, only for running out of diesel coming down the final furlong of the infamous semi-final and Galways Matthew Clancy delivering a hammer blow. As the years went past, the challenge dwindled. The  season ended in a comprehensive enough defeat to Kerry in the semi-final. There was the high-octane battle against the Dubs in the  Quarter-Final and the defeat to Tipperary in the last- clash in Breffni in . Outside of that, Derrys championship record of the last  years is a reality check. Of the  championship games, there were  wins,  defeats and a sole draw, against Tyrone in , Mickey Hartes first game in charge. Derry have played  qualier games, winning . Of the  defeats, three were after extra time and the only extra time win was over Cavan in  at Celtic Park. Of the  victories, only the  win over Mayo and a one-point win over Armagh the same year jump out as scalps. The win over Monaghan in Clones two years later was of note. The rest, on paper, were games Derry were favourites in, including three wins from four against Cavan – the only county Derry havent faced over the last two decades in the Ulster championship. Then you have the Longford story with one win in four games. Add in two wins from four against Laois, another team Derry would fancy beating. In Ulster, Derry have won just  times in  games, with that one draw thrown in. On the face of it, the result looks grim, but scratch the surface and  of those games were against either Donegal or Tyrone. Of that,  were in the first round. The  win, under the baking sun in Ballybofey, was Derrys only win over Donegal in eight attempts. Of the eight clashes with Tyrone, the famous  win in Omagh, when the Red Hands were All-Ireland champions, is the only victory. In fairness, thats a tough series of draws. Five of the defeats to Donegal came in an era when they were jostling in the pecking order behind Dublin. The same can be said for Tyrone. But Glenullin wouldve been fair from Ulster club contenders in , yet couldve dumped Dungiven out on their ear. A team with the McKeevers, Brolly, McGilligan, goalkeeper Eoin McCloskey and rising star Paul Murphy. As Derry go into this years Ulster championship, they search for a first win in the competition since  and there is a decent chance it will be Donegal again. From looking back at the championship records, it changes the attitude on where Derry currently sit. Yes, there is a lot of talent coming along, but there is nothing that breeds growth like winning games. And especially when against the odds. I think back to Castlebar in . After being relegated from Division  and shipping a hammering by Tyrone in Ulster, Derry were seconds away from turning Mayo over. Conor Loftus bagged a goal to change the game and Derry went out with a whimper after extra-time. Two years later, in the Ulster championship opener in Omagh, Derry had Tyrone momentarily on the ropes. But after Shane McGuigans goal, they needed to attack the jugular even more. Darren McCurry had the ball in the net a matter of seconds later, as Tyrone outscored Derry - to -. Then there was last years game with Armagh. If Derry had got anything out of the first ten minutes, when they were all at sea, theyd have had a brilliant chance of victory. Thats three games and three massive uses of the word , but thats where Derrys future lies. Speaking before the start of this season, manager Rory Gallagher highlighted how Derry, in recent years, failed to win games that mattered. He mentioned championship and key relegation or promotion games. The manner of both league wins so far point to a team that can have a real cut at the Ulster championship on the other side of battling for promotion. Derry need to replicate Dungiven from that night in Drumsurn, in the  championship. By hook or by crook, find a way of turning performances into results.

End to end swashbuckling football that turns the stomach inside out. Slaughtneils shoot-out with Kilcar in Omagh a few seasons back. Derrys win over Dublin in the  All-Ireland semi-final. Armagh and Kerrys blockbuster in the  All-Ireland Final are some that instantly jump onto this page. But championship is about so much more. It is about character and pulling a result from somewhere, like a rabbit from a hat. I think about Dungivens Ulster winning team of . Their performance against Errigal Ciaran that day in Clones was brilliant. It was a convincing win, but they nearly didnt get out of the first round of the championship in Derry that year. googletag.cmd.push In two nerve-tangling encounters at Drumsurn, they escaped from Glenullins clutches on the seat of their pants. Ruairi Boylans - nearly toppled them in the drawn game, before coming through by a point in a replay, their lowest winning margin of the season, second only to a two-point Ulster semi-final over St Pauls of Belfast. There are many others down the years, but when I think about the term championship team those two games in Drumsurn rush to the forefront of my mind. A team finding a way to win, Glenullin dying with their boots on. Chatting to Mark Lynch for a piece on Derrys encounters with Longford got me thinking. Are Derry really a qualier team  googletag.cmd.push More often than not, it was a sorry story from the house of pain. Before the qualiers began in , Derry were on the wrong end of two massive refereeing decisions. Henry Downeys perfectly time shoulder charge on Paddy McKeever yielded a free in as their Ulster semi-final with Armagh sat in the mixer, with the Orchard County going on to win the first of two Ulster titles. Then,  months later, they got another soft free – with BBC commentator and former Armagh legend Jimmy Smyth admitting as much on commentary – to go ahead before Anthony missed a chance to level the game from a free well outside the .     Sting through the championship records, I start to wonder how the mental scars couldve affected the county as a whole. Derrys runs to the All-Ireland Qualiers yielded the  tilt at Sam, only for running out of diesel coming down the final furlong of the infamous semi-final and Galways Matthew Clancy delivering a hammer blow. As the years went past, the challenge dwindled. The  season ended in a comprehensive enough defeat to Kerry in the semi-final. There was the high-octane battle against the Dubs in the  Quarter-Final and the defeat to Tipperary in the last- clash in Breffni in . Outside of that, Derrys championship record of the last  years is a reality check. Of the  championship games, there were  wins,  defeats and a sole draw, against Tyrone in , Mickey Hartes first game in charge. Derry have played  qualier games, winning . Of the  defeats, three were after extra time and the only extra time win was over Cavan in  at Celtic Park. Of the  victories, only the  win over Mayo and a one-point win over Armagh the same year jump out as scalps. The win over Monaghan in Clones two years later was of note. The rest, on paper, were games Derry were favourites in, including three wins from four against Cavan – the only county Derry havent faced over the last two decades in the Ulster championship. Then you have the Longford story with one win in four games. Add in two wins from four against Laois, another team Derry would fancy beating. In Ulster, Derry have won just  times in  games, with that one draw thrown in. On the face of it, the result looks grim, but scratch the surface and  of those games were against either Donegal or Tyrone. Of that,  were in the first round. The  win, under the baking sun in Ballybofey, was Derrys only win over Donegal in eight attempts. Of the eight clashes with Tyrone, the famous  win in Omagh, when the Red Hands were All-Ireland champions, is the only victory. In fairness, thats a tough series of draws. Five of the defeats to Donegal came in an era when they were jostling in the pecking order behind Dublin. The same can be said for Tyrone. But Glenullin wouldve been fair from Ulster club contenders in , yet couldve dumped Dungiven out on their ear. A team with the McKeevers, Brolly, McGilligan, goalkeeper Eoin McCloskey and rising star Paul Murphy. As Derry go into this years Ulster championship, they search for a first win in the competition since  and there is a decent chance it will be Donegal again. From looking back at the championship records, it changes the attitude on where Derry currently sit. Yes, there is a lot of talent coming along, but there is nothing that breeds growth like winning games. And especially when against the odds. I think back to Castlebar in . After being relegated from Division  and shipping a hammering by Tyrone in Ulster, Derry were seconds away from turning Mayo over. Conor Loftus bagged a goal to change the game and Derry went out with a whimper after extra-time. Two years later, in the Ulster championship opener in Omagh, Derry had Tyrone momentarily on the ropes. But after Shane McGuigans goal, they needed to attack the jugular even more. Darren McCurry had the ball in the net a matter of seconds later, as Tyrone outscored Derry - to -. Then there was last years game with Armagh. If Derry had got anything out of the first ten minutes, when they were all at sea, theyd have had a brilliant chance of victory. Thats three games and three massive uses of the word , but thats where Derrys future lies. Speaking before the start of this season, manager Rory Gallagher highlighted how Derry, in recent years, failed to win games that mattered. He mentioned championship and key relegation or promotion games. The manner of both league wins so far point to a team that can have a real cut at the Ulster championship on the other side of battling for promotion. Derry need to replicate Dungiven from that night in Drumsurn, in the  championship. By hook or by crook, find a way of turning performances into results.

Two wins from two is a pleasing start to their promotion challenge and McKaigue described their latest victory as a relatively disciplined performance. On a day when Derry scored - from play, he was pleased with his sides very clinical display in front of goal. “The goals changed the flow of the game, there is no doubt about that,” added McKaigue, who helped restrict Sean Quigley to a solidarity point from play. “We are under no illusions, we are still far from the finished article,” he also offered. Going the next step will only come with a run of games. He referred to a league semi-final that Derry have almost two feet in, with a score dference as good as an extra point on the table. googletag.cmd.push With Ulster champions Cavan coming down the tracks on Saturday, McKaigue expects no let up. “We have so much to work on and we havent had a huge amount of games.” he said. Then, factor in competition for places and his manager Rory Gallaghers outlook. “With the way Rory is, its a hard edge mentality and we try to win every game. We have to respect the other teams in the group and try to put our best foot forward.” McKaigue, who made his championship debut against Monaghan in , is the elder statesman of the team and the exciting young players coming into the fold were among the reasons why Derry backed themselves coming into Saturdays clash. googletag.cmd.push “Look at Ethan Doherty, look at Shane McGuigan, look at Conor Glass,” he points out. “We have Garethcoming from the back, Paudie Tadfully fit again and Paul Cassidy. “We have some pretty decent players coming through. They are starting to put their hand up and show they are inter-county footballers. “It showed in some of our attacking play, we were very slick and very clinical. We have a few things to tidy up on. We try to focus on ourselves, while giving the opposition the respect they deserve.” McKaigue is one of five current lists to have played in all four isions of the NFL, with Benny Heron the last to start a game in the top flight. The seven-point win over Cork at Owenbeg, in April , wasnt enough to stop Derry from the drop.     It was the last time the Oakleafers won a game in the Ulster championship, a competition McKaigue terms as unbelievably competitive. Winning matches of any kind and climbing the isions. Thats how he views the targets for the new-look Derry squad. “It has been two decent performances, but this group of players has still a bit to go, but the most important thing is winning games. Winning is the currency that matters in this sport. We want to compete and we want to win.” In terms of championship, Donegal and Tyrone have been around footballs top table and have knocked Derry out of the Ulster race. “I think our only focus is trying our very best to try and get out of Division . You want to ply your trade in a higher ision, then the championship takes care of itself. “There is no question about it, a good league campaign gives you great momentum for the championship. “We have nothing to concern ourselves with, only winning as many league games as possible to give us the best chance of preparing for a championship.” Suggesting crunch championship games Derry couldve won and you think of Mayo  and Tyrone , but McKaigue points to another. “The Tipperary gamewas a big one and we were very close to getting to the last  and they went on to the semi-final, to be narrowly beaten by Mayo. “Sometimes people think when youre beat in the Ulster championship, that the championship is over. Derry dont have a bad record in the qualiers, but we need to get a harder mentality to winning games and competing. “When you do that, then you can start talking about dferent rungs of the ladder. For us it is about Cavan and getting into a league semi-final andwe can get into that league semi-final, that is the first championship game of the year.” ALSO READ - Derry ease their way to victory over Fermanagh.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just over a year before his tragic and untimely death, Karl dragged Ballinascreen to the  title, overturning their U final defeat at the hands of Banagher two years earlier. The restructuring of the age grades, away from U, means the rescheduled  meeting of Lavey and Dungiven will be the last time a trophy will be presented in Karls honour. Karl proudly wearing his Ballinascreen colours. googletag.cmd.push Fittingly, Fridays showdown will be played at Ballinascreen, but his legacy wont end there. A banner placed prominently along the new walking track at Dean McGlinchey Park will keep his memory burning brightly. Either side of Karls photo are images of his Ballinascreen jerseys, football and hurling. His hurl and boots, as well as his distinctive helmet are also pictured. The generations that follow, those too young to remember his performances in the maroon and white, will be forever reminded of Karl. He epitomised sport. His jovial character made a team more than about training and games. On the flip-side, youd want him in your corner when the chips were down. googletag.cmd.push Step back in time. With seven minutes of the  U final remaining, Gavin ONeills penalty levelled matters and it was time for someone to stand up and be counted. Ballinascreen had that somebody. His name was Karl McAuley. After powering upfield, he laid the ball off to Carlus McWilliams and one pass later Dean Flanagan slotted the ball beyond goalkeeper Daryl McDermott for the game-defining goal. Ballinascreen captain on the day was Karls best friend Alastair Clerkin. They grew up a mile apart, were in the same class at the nearby Straw Primary School and soldiered together on the same football teams.     Ironically Alastairs son was born on the anniversary of Karls death. Alastair would place flowers on Karls grave and is still a close friend of the family. Shortly after Karls death, Alastairs mother Bernie left a statue at the grave of two warriors battling for a high ball, which inspired the design of the model handed out to the dozen who followed in Karls footsteps as Man of the Match. It helped Karls spirit stand the test of time. The Mid-Ulster Observers report described his  final midfield performance as a Tour de Force.  The Mid Ulster Observer match report from the  U Final The year after Karls death, Derry minors first trial was at Ballinascreen where had been tipped to play a starring role and nail down a place on the . There was an impeccable minute silence in the clubs hall before an army of nervous and excited trialists embarked on a morning of football. But for that minute, there wasnt a sound. And there will be a lump in every Ballinascreen throat on Friday night when the final U Man of the Match follows in Karls footsteps. He played around the middle for Ballinascreen teams, somewhere he could shape a game from. Those who knew him best, coached him and played alongside him tipped him for a long career. “Karl was brilliant that day,” Clerkin recalls of his box to box U final performance. “He was just everywhere and making things happen...he covered every blade of grass. “He wouldve been very consistent, but in that game, he was on a dferent level by his own standards. It was one of those games when he stood up and dragged the team with him.” It was fitting that Karls spadework made the dference, in the pressure cooker of the closing stages. Clerkin paid him the highest compliment, calling him a big game player. A championship man. Martin Boyle, who coached that U team with Mickey ONeill and Jerome Bradley, said how Karl, in his finest hour, simply dragged his side to victory by refusing to accept a defeat that was staring them in the face. Outside of the white heat of battle, Karl didnt take himself too serious. At training, many wouldve been on the receiving end of his jokes. Then, asflicking a switch, hed put his game face on and deliver by the bucketful, when it mattered. “He was there primarily for the craic and to enjoy himself and he was quite good at football as it happened,” Clerkin adds. “Hed still be playing with all the lads he grew up with...you miss the craic you wouldve had with him.” The banner to be erected at Dean McGlinchey Park.

The Kilrea team, led by James Kielt, who went through their entire club underage careers unbeaten overcame Ballinascreen in the  Feacuteile final. “He was our best player that day at corner back and he was a year young,” Boyle remembers. Boyle is now the Derry minor manager, a team that includes Matthew Downey and Dan Higgins, the last two winners of the U final Man of the Match. “I told them just how special an award it is as Karl was such a special person and sportsman.” Like Clerkin, Boyle echoed Karls off the pitch qualities. “Karl made a lasting impression on everyone fortunate enough to come into contact with him,” Boyle said. “In a team environment he was a dream, brilliant for morale and craic among lads.” At school, he played on St Colms U Derry championship winning team of , their first in many years. When asked for a memory of Karl McAuley, their coach Ciaran Meenagh looked back on their Ulster clash with St Pauls Bessbrook. St Colms were leading by two points, as the game ticked into the last  minutes in a foggy winter afternoon. After an off the ball incident, the game  boiled over. Meenagh points to it as a scary moment for a typical  year-old. But not Karl, who won the hop ball, kicked two late points and alongside Anton Kelly, the pair stemmed the tide. “It was just indicative of his character and his backbone,” Meenagh states. “He was tough and had a savage temperament...he would have gone far...I’m sure of that. “He was just a super lad altogether, what a character. He had a brilliant heart on the field of play.” The McAuley family will feel Karls loss more than anyone. Theyll miss him every day. But, tucked amongst those emotions, they can take strength from how he rubbed off on others. Those who competed with and against him on the playing fields of Derry and beyond held him in the highest regard. Its fitting the last piece of the history from the Derry U football championship will be the presentation of Karls award, the final Tour de Force. Thats his legacy. He will never be forgotten.

The SDLPs spokesperson for the economy and energy was speaking after the DUP obstructed a number of North-South ministerial meetings from proceeding. She said: “Ministers don’t get to take a pick and mix approach to their legal obligations - whether it’s North - South or East - West or in the Executive. All Ministers have to do our jobs and work in the interests of all our citizens. “For months now, elements within the DUP have purposely obstructed North - South meetings. The North South Ministerial Council is a requirement under the Good Friday Agreement and those in the DUP who say they believe in power sharing and devolution don’t get to pick and choose which parts of the agreement they implement. googletag.cmd.push “With a change in DUP leadership this week, there needs to be a change of approach from Edwin Poots. Even Edwin Poots has to face up to his legal responsibilities. The SDLP will not accept the DUP preventing these meetings that are crucial for agreement to be reached between Ministers in the North and the South on all island projects. That is why our Minister, SDLP Minister Nichola Mallon has written to the Attorney General for legal advice. No one, not Edwin, not the DUP, gets to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement on the SDLP’s watch.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves. Thatrsquos what he aimed to do with people and was always thinking of dferent things that he could start.Mr Mullan thanked everybody who had called him or send cards over the week and in particular, local priest, Fr Feargal McGrady, for his help and support over the years.Mr Mullanrsquos granddaughter, Mairead OrsquoHare, added: ldquoThese families have fought so tirelessly over the years to get justice for their loved ones, it has been both inspiring and heartbreaking to watch.ldquoI never met my great-uncle, but the stories my Granda tells regularly make his presence known and you can easily tell that the love my Granda has for his brother has never ceased.ldquoHe has known for the last  years that his brother was innocent, he didnrsquot need a coronerrsquos ruling to know that, but having Fr Mullan declared innocent to the entire world has brought much needed comfort and peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-World.jpg","title":"‘World knows Hugh was innocent’  ","story":"THE family of Ballymurphy Massacre victim Fr Hugh Mullan have welcomed a coronerrsquos ruling that he was an innocent ldquopeacemaker.The Portaferry priest was shot dead by soldiers as he tended to a wounded man on waste ground in west Belfast on August  .Fr Mullan and nine others shot dead were all exonerated in an inquest ruling by a coroner last week.At the time the Army reported that the nine men and one woman who died were Republican gunmen killed in crossfire.The first to die over the three days of shooting, Fr Mullan had only served a a church for seven months.Mrs Justice Keegan said in her findings that he was ldquounarmed, not acting in any way as a threat, attending to a wounded man in the field and waving a white object as a sign of his peaceful intentions.ldquoHe died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The shooting of the deceased has not been justied by the State. The use of force by the Army that resulted in his death was disproportionate.Fr Mullanrsquos youngest brother, Patsy, said that he and the rest of his family always knew the  year-old priest was innocent.Now , he said the first learnt something was wrong when he heard that a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy that day on the RTE late news.ldquoI knew right away it would be him, he was the type of person and would be out to help anyone in trouble or who was injured. That was just his nature. Unfortunately it was his downfall, said Mr Mullan, who still lives in Portaferry.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who would have been among people all the time, helping people.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny.Mr Mullan was left unimpressed with an apology that Prime Minister Boris Johnston made in a call to former First Minister Arlene Foster.ldquoI wouldnrsquot have wanted an apology from him actually. I donrsquot have much time for him at the best of times because I donrsquot think hersquos the best person for that job.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan, his son Hugh and other family members attended nearly all  days the inquest since it started in November .Mrs McGrattan said that hearing the judgersquos findings ldquolted a weight of me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows, she said.ldquoTo hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was as though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released.

This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more. This is a great new initiative but we also have to look at how litter gets into the sea in the first place which poses problems for trawler skippers as this waste gets tangled up in their nest which is time-consuming and a distraction they could well do without, he said.ldquoThe Fishery Harbour Authority is to be congratulated for bringing this initiative to the Co Down ports and the more skippers that sign up for lsquofishing for litterrsquo the better. The scheme can help protect the environment and reduce the amount of unsightly litter being washed up along the shoreline..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business support programme helps secure 78 jobs in district  ","story":"A COUNCIL-LED local business support programme has created  jobs in the last  months.According to new figures released, the Business Growth and Tender for Growth programmes facilitated by Newry, Mourne and Down District Council have helped to create an average of one new job each week.The programmes are part-funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Despite the impact of recent lockdowns over the last  months, NMD Business has continued to provide SMEs with support packages in response to challenges created by the pandemic.This has resulted in ongoing growth for the business and the creation of  new job roles, as well as helping  businesses involved in the programme to navigate an unprecedented economic environment.Participants in the programme are able to avail of one-to-one mentoring from leading experts, who help guide them and their business through unprecedented times, as well as learning new skills in financial management, cross-border sales and maximising your chances of winning tenders.As a result, many businesses have been able to not only grow their business, but grow their workforce.Sara Velasquez, from Ecoplastic in Downpatrick, completed the programme last year and has already recruited four new staff for the business.Her firm designs and makes all kinds of structures from % recycled material, from boardwalks to street furniture, bridges to bike trails and picnic tables.She said: ldquoThe NMD Business programme helped us focus on the most lucrative areas for growth for our business.ldquoOur dedicated mentor provided us with expert guidance which allowed us to respond quickly to a new market environment, giving us confidence that decisions we were taking were anchored in good commercial sense, while the workshops equipped us with new skills that will stand us in good stead into the future.ldquoSales have since increased as a result and we continue to work on exciting projects across Ireland and the UK.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed. They are due to reopen shortly.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to reopen council toilets across the Rowallane area and said the fact that these particular public conveniences have been closed or over a year was ldquounacceptable.He said steps should have been taken earlier to ensure that staff were available to open and maintain the ious facilities.Cllr Walker was particularly critical of the decision to keep toilets in Killyleagh closed given the number of people who visited the town over recent months as Covid restrictions eased.ldquoPublic toilets across the Rowallane area were closed too long for my liking and I am aware that there was concern that conveniences at the townrsquos Market House and nearby community centre were also closed, he continued.ldquoI have been informed that all public toilets across the district will be reopened by June and that is welcome news. With the further easing of lockdown restrictions there will be an increase in the number of visitors to the area and it is vital that all conveniences are available..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Success.jpg","title":"Success for young stars in virtual competition  ","story":"PUPILS from Mourne Stars Speech and Drama in Newcastle have been celebrating success once again.Many pupils from Clare Murninrsquos classes took part in Newry Feis this year as they usually would have done previous years.This year was a little dferent.

Instead it was a virtual competition where pupils sent in video recordings of their poetry recitals.All of the pupils used excellent vocal skills showing wonderful confidence in all age categories.ldquoThe Newry Feis is a wonderful opportunity for the pupils of speech and drama to show off everything they learn in class, for example, proper use of tone, pause, pace, pitch, projection, volume and articulation skills, Clare explained.She said she was proud of every one of her pupils who entered the competitions and thanks all of the parents for their unwavering support.She also said she was delighted to see so many of the pupils be awarded within their age categories, which she described as an excellent tribute to the hard work they all put in.If you are interested in your son or daughter taking part in speech and drama contact Clare via email mournestars@gmail or follow Mourne Stars Speech and Drama on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Tally.jpg","title":"Tally’s men lose out to Mayo stars in opener  ","story":"DOWN senior footballers did not have their fairytale start back in Division  after being comprehensively beaten by a strong Mayo side.It was always going to be an uphill battle for Paddy Tallyrsquos team as they faced off against a recently demoted Mayo outfit in Castlebar.Despite last yearrsquos relegation, Mayo began their campaign with strong intent and although the Mourne county could not be faulted for lack of heart, it was soon clear it was the home sidersquos game to lose.Down started admirably, matching Mayo for the first  minutes as the sides scored four points a piece.However, it wouldnrsquot be long before Tommy Conroy would open the goal scoring as he rapidly burst through the Down defence to place the ball under goalkeeper Rory Burns.Down showed they would not go without a fight and chalked up a couple more points to bring the scores - to - at the half-time interval.The game was perhaps put completely beyond the red and black outfitrsquos reach when Mayo fired home another goal on the  minute-mark.A consolation goal from Down substitute Stephen McConville allowed for a more modest scoreline but evidently, it was clear that this Mayo side will no doubt be pushing for ato the top tier.Down manager Paddy Tally reflected on his teamrsquos performance after the full-time whistle.ldquoI felt, at times, we just didnrsquot get to the intensity of the game, he said. ldquoTo be honest, it was always going to be a wee bit of fun coming here today to see where the boys are at.Itrsquos a bit freaky, a team like Mayo being in Division Two. Naturally there would be a bit of a gap in experience and quality.Mayo manager James Horan was delighted with his teamrsquos effort as he looks ahead to a promising campaign.ldquoSix or seven sessions is all wersquove had so we were very unsure because we just didnrsquot know where we would be, he said.ldquoThe guys, you could see there, did a huge amount of work inidually over the winter. They were in very good shape and quickly got up to speed, he continued.ldquoWe got sloppy towards the end but overall we were very happy with today.Down now look ahead to the weekend when they face off against Meath following their win over Westmeath.Mayo: R Hennelly E Hession, O Mullin , L Keegan M Plunkett , P Durcan, R Brickenden M Ruane , D OrsquoConnorF McDonagh , K McLoughlin, J FlynnT Conroy , C OrsquoConnor , R OrsquoDonoghue .Subs used: E McLaughlinfor Brickenden, B Walsh for FlynnC Loftus for McDonaghS Coen for McLoughlin, A Orme for OrsquoDonoghue , J McCormack for D OrsquoConnor , C Boyle for Keegan .Down: R Burns G Collins, G McGovern, P Murdock K McKernan, P Laverty, J Flynn R McEvoy, C Mooney J Guinness , C Poland, C Doherty D Guinness , C Quinn , B OrsquoHagan .Subs used: L Kerrfor DohertyO McCabe for PolandD OrsquoHagan for McKernanP Devlinfor McKernan, L Middleton for Quinn, S McConvillefor McEvoyB McArdle for Murdock Mayo -Down -NFL DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Tohear.jpg","title":"To hear Hugh was a ‘peacemaker’ was very touching  ","story":"GERALDINE McGrattan was  and away on a holiday in Tralee when she first heard that her beloved uncle, Fr Hugh Mullan, had been shot dead in Ballymurphy in Belfast on August , .The tragic news was confirmed to her grandparents, John and Mary Mullan, around am the following day.Her mother Teresa, Hughrsquos eldest sister, was pregnant at the time and Geraldine could not wait to get home to Portaferry.ldquoGranny was distraught, I arrived home late on the Tuesday evening as it took so long and to get through the Newry border checkpoint, she recalled.ldquoIt was so unbelievable, I picked up a paper in Dublin to read what had happened. My uncle was the first to be shot, then Frank Quinn, the  year-old, who was shot beside him and killed.What hurt Geraldine and the wider Mullan family so much was in press reports Fr Mullan was said to have been involved in a gun battle with soldiers.ldquoHe was such a big part of our family le, for the lies that were told about him were very dficult for us all, she said. ldquoIt was hard enough to lose him, but to lose him like that and then everything afterward was so hard.She said on that fateful day, her uncle had been trying all day to calm things down.ldquoThere was trouble from Loyalists behind Springfield Park and the people in Springfield Park started to evacuate their houses and tried to flee across a piece of waste ground over to Moyard to safety.ldquoBricks and stones were being thrown at their houses and houses were badly damaged. They were carrying children across the waste ground and firing started. A man, Bobby Clarke, was shot and wounded in a field and local people called for a priest as they thought he was going to die.ldquoUncle Hugh had been standing outside his own house and had spent the day ringing the Army, trying to get thing quietened and calmed. He called the Army to tell them that he was going out to the wasteland to help an injured man. Then he got a white cloth, began to wave it and went out onto the wasteland.ldquoHe got to Bobby and he told Uncle Hugh he wasnrsquot too bad. Uncle Hugh said he would go and get him an ambulance but would give him the Anointing of the Sick to help him anyway.ldquoHe did that and he was making his way back to get an ambulance when he was shot. He was shot at least twice and left in the field. Frank Quinn went out to help Uncle Hugh and he was shot and died instantly.The family never received any official explanation about Fr Mullanrsquos death.ldquoIn the early days, we were told that Uncle Hugh had been killed in crossfire during a gun battle, said Mrs McGrattan. ldquoNewspapers reported that he was a gunman, carrying a weapon. No one ever contacted us, there was never a person at the door to tell us what had happened.Along with the joy from last Tuesday of the coronerrsquos ruling that Fr Mullan was an innocent, Mrs McGrattan said there was also a lot of sadness for her.ldquoIt was a sad day as my grandparents, John and Mary, werenrsquot there to hear it, nor were my parents, Teresa and Gerry, my husband Gerard and my brother Hugh Kearney. So many of us have died in those  years and didnrsquot get to hear the good words she used.There was another loss for her family mdash her mother Teresarsquos baby died at birth and her parents moved to England shortly afterwards.Mrs McGrattan said she was really moved to hear the testimonies of civilian witnesses who gave evidence during the inquest.ldquoWhenever Mrs Justice Keegan said that Hughrsquos story was stark and in her opinion, he was a peacemaker, and totally innocent, it lted a weight off me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows. To hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released. It was a great day.She praised and thanked the Portaferry community for their support over the years.ldquoThe people of Portaferry were so generous and so kind to the whole family at that time, actually all through the years.

Access should only be restrictedany confidential information is discussed. If any person considers that access to meetings is being restricted unnecessarily, their first step should be to approach the council with these concerns.But access remained denied, so the Minister was asked to amend legislation around this sticking point.A spokesperson replied: ldquoGiven legislation currently allows public press access to committees and subcommittees subject to the exclusions previously advised, the Department is not at this time considering making amendments.This was shared with councillors, with all who replied commenting positively around press attendance.Councillor Barry McElduff, Sinn Fein formally called for press to be permitted access to Health Group meetings and Chief Executive Alison McCullagh suggested this could be achieved by upgrading to subcommittee status.Following unanimous agreement in December, BBC Local Democracy enquired when this could be expected, and were advised it was part of an ongoing review.The matter arose last week, and what started out as a victory for democracy, quickly dwindled when members learned upgrading meant quota rules of membership would apply.Councillor Emmet McAleer, Independent suggested retaining working group status, but opening meetings to public and press, but the Chair Councillor Stephen McCann replied: ldquoThat conversation has been had a number of times and we are aware why that cannot happen. However it was given extra clout as a subcommittee, I understand the press would have access. That would address some concerns members have raised in the past.The Chief Executive stressed: ldquoThe only dference is Standing Orders apply in subcommittees, therefore press and public would have normal access.Current Health Group member Councillor Donal OrsquoCofaigh, Independent, acknowledged subcommittee status would cost him his place under the quota, but nonetheless was willing to agreeit meant public and press access.SDLP Councillor Mary Garrity said: ldquoIf itrsquos not legislatively enforceable, we come upon this quandary, whether we like it or not.However she felt working group status meant reporting back to full council and: ldquoAbsent the press, we would still get all our concerns highlighted.The Chief Executive confirmed: ldquoActions would be reported, irrespective of working group or subcommittee status.Councillor Josephine Deehan, Independent found it: ldquoRegrettable we didnrsquot have information regarding legislative requirements prior to making this decision. Irsquom concerned that members of small parties and independents would be excluded. I strongly believe in inclusion and as elected members we have a duty to represent our constituents.She added: ldquoTherersquos not a huge amount of dference between a subcommittee and a working group. In terms of involving the press and public, we would have the opportunity to raise issues at standing committees.Proposing retention of the current working group status to ensure inclusivity and current membership, Councillor Deehan said: ldquoThe only dference is access to the public and press hellipRepresentation and input from members is more important and should be the greater priority.This was seconded by Councillor Garrity.Councillor McElduff requested clarity around press access noting: ldquoObviously where possible, when we arenrsquot talking about issues which are confidential, wersquod want to err on the side of openness and transparency.The Chief Executive pointed to legislation in which: ldquoThere is no provision for press or public to attend working group meetings.Councillor Adam Gannon, SDLP noted the Health Group was: ldquoLooked at to change into a subcommittee because some members wanted it opened to the press. Whilst it would be nice to have public access to everything, it may not always happen and canrsquot always be that way.Concluding the discussion, he said whatever the status of the group: ldquoThe work is still being done. It would be nice for the public to be present, but we donrsquot need the press there to do our work. I know I donrsquot.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They also require a dense tree line for their flight path,” Mr Greer said.Anyone who hasinformation or advice on these rare, protected animals and their migratory patterns is welcome to get in touch, he added.Kilwaughter Minerals Ltd, which owns one of the banks of the lake, said it had lowered the water level in accordance with recommendations from the Department for Infrastructure.The Department said recently: “KilwaughterMinerals Limited are the reservoir manager forKilwaughterPond. In common with other reservoir managers they have a responsibility to ensure the safe condition of their reservoir in line with their common law responsibilities.

Please try again later.Submitting...Both are highly intelligent but maverick figures.Since Mr Johnson was mayor of London, he has known that he is a very popular public figure, and his political demeanour has always been arrogant, even swaggering.His boast last March that he would shake hands with people, after this had been shown to be a method of spreading Covid, was a case of cockiness tipping into recklessness.It was one of a string of pronouncements that suggested a cavalier attitude to a pandemic that, weeks later, would almost kill Mr Johnson.The Downing Street response to Covid will one day be examined in a public inquiry, but there is little doubt that the UK was one of the worse performing European countries, for reasons that are not as yet widely agreed.At the top of government sat a dysal duo. Mr Johnson had met his match in Mr Cummings, who is a brilliant organiser and campaigner and thinker. His belief in overthrowing systems of governance was not of itself an unreasonable one, given the huge inefficiencies of complacent bureaucracies. The problem was that it was never clear who or what would be the next casualty, as Northern Ireland did.EvenMr Cummings never said, as claimed, that he hoped NI would disappear into the Irish Sea, we do know for sure that Mr Johnson came to Belfast to give a pledge to the DUP about never accepting an Irish Sea border but did just that a year later as soon as he had the keys to Downing Street.Mr Cummings’ evidence yesterday should be treated with caution, because he has a grudge. Yet much of it rings true.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There are also around  to  cases of the India iant in parts of Scotland, including Glasgow, with these cases again connected to travel.The India Covid iant, officially known as B.., was first detected in India in October.It has been designated a ldquoiant of concern by PHE as it is thought to be at least as transmissible as the iant detected in Kent last year, known as B, which is now dominant in the UK.PHE said there is currently no evidence to suggest that the new Indian iant is more serious than previous mutations, nor is there evidence which indicates that this version of the Indian iant is resistant to current vaccines.Health experts said they ldquohavenrsquot seen any hint of a current Covid iant that can fully evade the effectiveness of vaccines.On Wednesday , the European Medicines Agency said it was ldquopretty confident that vaccines currently in use will be effective against the Indian iant, a view that has been echoed by some British scientists.However, Professor James Naismith from the University of Oxford said not enough is known to say for sure whether the iant could frustrate the UKrsquos vaccination programme.Speaking on BBC Radio rsquos Today programme, he said: ldquoThe vaccines donrsquot  per cent prevent infection for people.ldquoWhat they do is, they almost  per cent prevent hospitalisation and serious illness.ldquoWe donrsquot know enough to know yet whether the Indian strain will behave dferently than that.ldquoSo even the regular virus can infect people who have been vaccinated and sometimes you do get reinfection.Could the iant delay lockdown ending The growing number of India Covid iant cases in the UK has sparked concerns that the lting of lockdown restrictions, which is set for  June in England, could now be delayed.Ministers have also not ruled out re-introducing local lockdowns in areas where the iant of concern is increasing.Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said that the government will make decisions based on the data, and measures will be eased ldquoat a pace and in a way which is safe.Symptoms to look forThe main symptoms of coronavirus to look for include:a high temperature ndash this means you feel hot to touch on your chest or back a new, continuous cough ndash this means coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in  hours a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste ndash this means youve noticed you cannot smell or taste anything, or things smell or taste dferent to normalMost people with symptoms have at least one of these symptoms, although some do not experience any. As such, it is advised that everyone gets tested regularly to help prevent further spread of the virus. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was ldquocomplete nonsense to claim the Government had put a shield around care homes, Mr Cummings claimed, but Mr Jenrick insisted ldquoitrsquos not correct to say that we didnrsquot do everything we possibly could to protect both the residents and the people who work in care homes, with the imperfect information we had available to us at the time.Responding to Mr Cummingsrsquo assessment that the pandemic demonstrated a country of ldquolions led by donkeys, Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: ldquoWell I donrsquot think thatrsquos a fair assessment of what happened.He added: ldquoI think the Prime Minister led the country through this with huge determination and resilience.ldquoHe himself almost died of Covid at one point, bounced back, got back into running the country incredibly quickly.Mr Jenrick rejected the claim that ldquotens of thousands of people died unnecessarily during the crisis.Asked directly whether he thinks that claim is wrong, he told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoYes, I think it is, because you have to remember that we didnrsquot have all of the facts at the time that the decisions were being taken.ldquoNobody, I think, could doubt for one moment that the Prime Minister was doing anything other than acting with the best of motives with the information and the advice that was available to him.Mr Jenrick refused to say whether or not Mr Cummings was a reliable source of information about the Governmentrsquos handling of the pandemic. vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Cummings giving evidence ldquoHersquos now left government, and you heard him

Mark Sedwill had ldquolost confidence in the Secretary of Statersquos honesty.A spokesman for Mr Hancock said ldquowe absolutely reject the criticisms made by Mr Cummings.Downing Street said on Wednesday Mr Hancock continued to have the confidence of the Prime Minister and the pair were ldquoworking closely to save lives.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is likely to face questions of his own about the explosive evidence from his once-closest aide when he visits a hospital on Thursday.As well as being branded unfit for office, it was alleged Mr Johnson dismissed the pandemic as a ldquoscare story or the new ldquoswine flu in early  as the global crisis loomed and wanted to be injected with Covid- on television in a bid to calm the nation.Mr Cummings, who was ousted from No  late last year as part of a behind-the-scenes power struggle, said that, by the end of October , his relationship with Mr Johnson had deteriorated due to the Prime Ministerrsquos delays to ordering an autumn lockdown that could have prevented deaths. vw,vw,px, px\"The Prime Minister was criticised as lsquounfitrsquo for the job by his former aide Dominic Cummings He said that he ldquofundamentally regarded him as unfit

pandemic in Britain, Mr Cummings described his mounting panic about the situation in March .The -year-old said there was no plan in place for a lockdown or measures to protect the most vulnerable and quoted deputy cabinet secretary Helen MacNamara who, he claimed, told him she thought the country was ldquoabsolutely f***** and that ldquowersquore going to kill thousands of people.The first lockdown was finally implemented on March , but Mr Cummings said the Prime Minister later regretted the move.Similar mistakes were made in September as Mr Johnson was urged by Government scientists to impose a second lockdown but he resisted because of economic concerns, instead opting to ldquohit and hope.Askedhe had heard Mr Johnson say he would rather see ldquobodies pile high than impose a
