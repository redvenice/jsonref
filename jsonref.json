After a fight broke out they started used guns.\u0027              The vote also ushers in a powerful new executive presidency long sought by Erdogan and backed by a small majority of Turks in a 2017 referendum. Critics say it will further erode democracy in the NATO member state and entrench one-man rule.Polling stations closed at 5pm local time.

He also urged YSK members to \u0027do your job the right way\u0027, adding he believed the results would be \u0027very good\u0027.Opposition parties and NGOs deployed up to half a million monitors at ballot boxes to ward against fraud. They have said election law changes and fraud allegations in the 2017 referendum raise fears about the vote\u0027s fairness.Earlier, CHP spokesman Bulent Tezcan said the party had reported to the YSK allegations of block votes being cast and of election monitors being beaten and kept out of polling stations in the southeast\u0027s Sanliurfa province.YSK chairman Sadi Guven told the state-owned news agency Anadolu it was taking steps in response to reports of irregularities in the town of Suruc near the Syrian border.The government gave no immediate response to the reports, but Erdogan said there had not been any serious problems.           Earlier today opposition party member Mehmet Sıddık Durmaz (pictured) was reportedly shot dead \u0027during the voting process\u0027, local media said          A woman waits to vote at a polling station in snap twin Turkish presidential and parliamentary elections in Istanbul today          Turks went to the polls this morning in presidential and parliamentary elections that pose the biggest ballot box challenge to Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power over 15 years ago          Chairman of the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu arrive to cast their ballot at a polling station during the parliamentary and presidential elections, in AnkaraTurkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with decrees - for nearly two years since an attempted coup in 2016.Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on his followers in Turkey, detaining some 160,000 people, according to the United Nations.The president\u0027s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. \u0027This is no longer a Turkey we want. Rights are violated, democracy is in terrible shape,\u0027 said health sector worker Sema, 50, after voting in Istanbul.She and others in the city said they voted for the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u0027 Democratic Party (HDP), hoping it would exceed the ten per cent threshold of votes needed to enter parliament.

Pictured: A queue of voters in Istanbul today Turkey\u0027s state-run news agency, meanwhile, said police have arrested six people for allegedly insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of a campaign rally by his main opponent as Turks go to the polls today.The Anadolu Agency said the six were detained yesterday days after videos posted on social media reportedly showed them shouting expletives against Erdogan. The news agency said they were later charged with \u0027insulting state elders.\u0027The agency said police were searching for other suspects.Insulting the president is a crime punishable by up to four years in prison. Erdogan has filed close to 2,000 lawsuits against people, including school children, for insulting him.       Hundreds of thousand of supporters of Muharrem Ince, the main presidential candidate facing Erdogan, gather in Istanbul yesterday          Recep Tayyip Erdogan held his own rally for the AK Party in the Esenyurt district of Istanbul yesterday          Erdogan at a rally of his own supporters this week in the city of Kahramanmaras on Thursday.

The opposition is seeking to prevent Erdogan winning a fourth term as the country\u0027s leader Ince has held three rallies in three days in the cities of Ankara and Izmir.   Throwing down the gauntlet to the president, Ince said: \u0027Look, that\u0027s my last proposal to you. If you want, I can even cancel my Istanbul rally for you. Come, confront me, let\u0027s debate on TV.\u0027The event was the second giant rally the opposition leader addressed within the space of two days.Erdogan, a favourite to win the presidential polls, has in the past rejected the opposition candidate\u0027s proposal for a television debate, saying that \u0027I don\u0027t want anyone to get points through me\u0027.Ince has injected a breath of fresh air into the presidential campaign with his dynamism and oratorical skills comparable to those of Erdogan. In Ankara, Ince accused the state-run Anadolu news agency and TRT television of committing a \u0027constitutional crime\u0027 for failing to be even-handed.\u0027TRT aired Erdogan for 181 hours, Muharrem Ince for 15 hours,\u0027 he said.Turkey News, Pictures and Videos plus Erdogan Updates | Daily Mail Online¿Y¿ Party district head shot dead during voting in Turkish election"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/18/4D96EF7700000578-5880211-image-a-19_1529861182825.jpg","title":"Gabby Logan soaked beer England fans half time Panama World Cup clash","story":"    Close call: As well as being soaked in beer, Gabby Logan was nearly drenched by sprinklers  She had to e out of the way to avoid the water ahead of England\u0027s 6-1 win over PanamaLogan was meant to appear on screen during the break, but instead she could be heard telling host Gary Linkeker and the other pundits that she\u0027d be drenched in booze.  She said: \u0027 Listen - if you can smell me right now, it\u0027s because somebody threw a pint of beer from the stands over me.Six of the best!

Employees of Zaman gather after it was seized in a crackdown against Gulen supportersAfter Erdogan became the President in 2014, he survived an attempted coup by factions within the military and went on to win the referendum on increased presidential powers.At the time, Erdogan said that the plot was engineered by the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who headed up a network of schools educating people about the Hizmet movement, which promotes altruism and modesty.Since then, Turkish courts have jailed dozens of officers for alleged coup plots after the failed attempt, which claimed at least 240 lives.According to officials, Erdogan’s life was also put in danger while staying in Marmaris, but he was back in less than 12 hours with a TV appearance during which he declared himself a ‘chief commander’.Although the Turkish President has resolved economic problems, he has also been considered to be an autocratic leader who is against anyone who opposes him.Despite denying that he wants to impose Islamic values and revealing that he is committed to secularism, his supporters still refer to him as ‘Sultan’, a reference to the Ottoman Empire.Turkey lifted the ban on women wearing headscarves in the country’s state institutions in 2013 but bids to criminalise adultery and introduce alcohol-free zones failed.          Supporters of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan wave national flags as they wait for his arrivalErdogan has also stated that ‘no Muslim family’ should consider birth control or family planning because of his aim to ‘multiply our descendants’.The AKP has also managed to keep inflation under control after the 1990s when it soared above 100 percent, but in 2014, the economy started to change and unemployment rose above 10 percent.Erdogan wifeRecep Tayyip Erdogan married Emine Gulbaran in July 4, 1978 and the couple have two sons, Ahmet Burak and Necmettin Bilal and two daughters, Esra and Sumeyye.2018 Turkish electionsErdogan declared victory in the Turkish presidential election in June 2018 amid speculation of ‘manipulated’ results and the President received the executive powers he has sought in order to tighten his grip on the nation.The AKP will now rule over Turkey until 2023 after its victory in parliamentary and presidential polls, taking 42.5 percent while Erdogan garnered 52.5 percent of the vote. The opposition’s candidate Muharrem Ince, took nearly 31 percent.President Erdogan will now form a government as well as appoint ministers, vice presidents and top bureaucrats. He will also be able to issue decrees, prepare budgets and impose states of emergency.The role of prime minister has now been scrapped and is thought to further dilute democracy in Turkey under Erdogan’s one-man rule.Erdogan net worthRecep Tayyip Erdogan’s net worth has accumulated to approximately $58 million (£44m) and is the richest Turkish politician according to Top Richest. Erdogan was also listed as the 48th most powerful person on the 2018 Forbes list.However, this figure seems a little high for someone who just earns $58,000 (£44,000) a year, as reported by German newspaper Bild. The article then went on to cite data published by Turkish opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet which stated that all members of the Erdogan family appear to be in business.Bild also revealed that Erdgogan\u0027s son Ahmet’s net worth amounted to around $80 million (£60m) and made claims that he may be supported by the Turkish government.Erdogan’s other son Bilal, who frequently garners media attention for alleged criminal activity, now lives in Italy after being embroiled in a political corruption scandal.The Turkish President also has one of the most lavish official residences in the world, the Ak Saray, otherwise known as the White Palace, which has a whopping 1,100 rooms, 250 of which are for the sole use of the Erdogan family.Thought to be 30 times the size of the White House and believed to be the largest palace built anywhere in the world for more than 100 years, a reported £7 million was spent on carpets and another £5 million on 400 10ft high double doors.The silk wallpaper is thought to have cost £2,000 a roll and one drinking glass in the household is worth £250. Due to the numerous spas, swimming pools, bathrooms and steam rooms, the heating bill is thought to run up to £500,000 every winter. The entire home is thought to have cost £500 million to construct.What Kate Middleton\u0027s title could be once The Queen dies Australia vs Peru: All you need to know about kick off time, squads, stadium and oddsWorld Cup 2018 \u0026#8211 Day 13: Google Doodle celebrates the FIFA tournament Nigeria vs. Argentina: All you need to knowWho is Maxine Waters?

He allegedly fathered a son with his aide Dr Henrietta Morton-King 20 months ago after an affair while she worked in his Westminster office in 2015She lives with her parents near Hastings, about 20 miles from Mr Merriman’s family home, and works at a beauty salon providing Botox-style treatments. A source told The Sun:  ‘Huw and Hetty started the affair while she was working as his assistant and it carried on after she moved to finish her medical training at Conquest Hospital, near Hastings.‘She later gave birth at the same hospital.’ The source added: ‘The relationship with Hetty is now over. Huw has stayed with his wife who is fully aware of the situation.’ Dr Morton-King, whose friends and family call her Hetty, went to the University of Bristol where she studied medicine.She then specialised in aesthetic medicine at North Cumbria University Hospitals and on Harley Street in London, which is renowned for its cosmetic surgery clinics.Dr Morton-King then took a career break and worked in her local MP Huw Merriman\u0027s office.It is believed that she then transferred to Conquest Hospital, Hastings, to continue her medical training after falling pregnant, and also had her son there.A year after his birth she joined the \u0027Beauty Barn\u0027 in Battle, where she offers dermal fillers and wrinkle relaxing using Botox just three miles from the home she shares with her parents. The affair is said to have begun shortly after Mr Merriman was elected to Parliament in May 2015.

She later dropped her £250,000 claim against the MP.Mr Merriman always denied the one night stand took place. One witness said they saw him looking \u0027sheepish\u0027 in his pants the morning after, the tribunal heard.Describing the one night stand Ms Campbell told the East London tribunal in 2016: \u0027Huw and I cooked and drank more wine.\u0027He kissed me after dinner and we ended up in my bed and had sex.\u0027I woke up in his arms he asked me if I was OK and I said yes but that it would never happen again.\u0027According to Ms Campbell, the only person she told about the one night stand was her sister, but did reveal her house mate would have known Mr Merriman had slept in her bed.Ms Campbell told the tribunal their previous relationship in the late 1990s was not sexual and she ended it because Mr Merriman had a girlfriend in New York, who later became his wife.Following a Christmas lunch at The Gun pub in 2012 Mr Merriman \u0027insinuated\u0027 he wanted a sexual relationship, she told the tribunal.Ms Campbell, who claimed Mr Merriman was a notorious womaniser who\u0027s had a string of affairs, said he wanted to marry her after a Christmas lunch in 2012.Ms Campbell was made redundant in 2014, which she claimed was unfair.

One of the cohorts will have to start outside  normal teaching hours.The early start was met with criticism by many Durham students.Celine Delal Kart, a first year law student told Palatinate, the university’s student newspaper: ‘It feels like this is a stab in the dark. I’d understand if it affected one or two of my modules, but it’s half of them.‘The time we’re expected to dedicate to reading, internships, CV building, extra curricular and independent study will undoubtedly be further influenced by this, as it’s difficult to sustain an effective work mode when fatigued.\u0027          The  university decided to introduce 8am lectures as it was struggling to cope with demand.

After 201819, the new teaching building – with its large lecture theatre – will ease the pressure on demand for our 300-seater teaching spaces.’The announcement comes after neurological research suggested early mornings interfere with young adults’ body clocks.According to the Open University study, lectures should start no earlier than 11am for students to be able to perform at their best.

She has remained a loving person and is always ready to help. She is not arrogant and despite all the success and fame, she still has got much love in her heart.\u0027There were so many friends and relatives in need and she never said no.\u0027I believe that success came to her because she is immensely hard-working. She achieved it solely on her own, without any nepotism.\u0027The woman who gave birth to the future catwalk queen at the age of 20 said Natalia grew up very quickly from the age of six when her sister Oksana, who suffers cerebral palsy and autism, was born. \u0027Maybe Natalia\u0027s success is a gift from above, because she alone took care of her disabled sister Oksana. Natasha was always there for Oksana. From the age of six she knew how to look after a child.\u0027Larisa orced her husband and has since re-married and had a third daughter Kristina, but she said the cornerstone of their fight for survival in impoverished conditions was the girl who would grow up to become a super star.\u0027I could leave the sisters to go to work, being sure that Natasha would do all the cooking and washing, as well as take care of the child.\u0027And I think that her love and hard work became the basis, which still helps her keep up.          Natalia\u0027s mum said despite her international background, having  married  an English man and now with a French man, her daughter is supporting her country to lift the trophy in Moscow          Natalia, pictured with three of her five children, is excited by her country\u0027s showing in the World Cup so far, her mother Larisa says. She added: \u0027We talked about the World Cup yesterday. She is amazed by the results of the Russian team\u0027  Natalia, pictured left in front of the Kremlin and right in Moscow, has used her global fame to help promote the World Cup \u0027Her friends would often mock her because of the disabled sister. They wouldn\u0027t want Oksana to hang out with them and Natasha would say \u0027We either go together or we don\u0027t go at all\u0027. You see a boomerang …everything returns to you.\u0027 The big sister left home when she reached 17 to pursue her dreams having seen her father walk out and being forced to sell berries from a barrow in freezing local markets to help her family. \u0027When she first left Russia at 17 she could not even speak English, and the modelling agency did not provide interpreters. She used to attend drama classes as a child, so she always knew how to present herself.\u0027But Natasha never finished school.  She didn\u0027t take her exams, so she has no high-school diploma. But we are proud of her. For me she is not a famous woman, not a star, but my daughter. I am overwhelmed with pride.\u0027In fact, knowing how hard-working and persistent she is, I understand how she has become so successful. When she has a goal, she strives for it and she never gives up.\u0027 Bidding her eldest daughter farewell as she took a plane from her hometown which was known as Gorky under Soviet Rule, she said she could never have dreamed her daughter would find world-wide fame.Natalia has modelled for Givenchy, Prada, Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Gucci as well as representing Stella McCartney, Hugo Boss and Gucci and H\u0026ampM.She has also been a cover star of magazines the world over and has received Vogue India\u0027s Women of The Year awards and had a doll made of her in Russia. \u0027I had no idea that she would become so famous. When she was leaving, I knew that it was the beginning of something big, but not that big,\u0027 said her mother.Larisa\u0027s home has an old 1990\u0027s-style TV and few mod cons in the kitchen, where a cupboard door is hanging from its hinges.On entering, the only clue that this is a family which has travelled is a fridge magnet of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, where Larisa visits her daughter twice a year.          Mummy\u0027s girl: Natalia\u0027s is close to her mother, Larisa, pictured. They talk on the phone every day and meet up at least twice a year either in  Russia or elsewhere depending on her schedule          Larisa, pictured with Natalia\u0027s grandmother also Larisa said: \u0027Unfortunately, we don\u0027t see each other often, because I can\u0027t leave Oksana. We meet about two times a year.          Natalia\u0027s grandmother Larisa, pictured, gets to see her granddaughter more often as she goes to stay with her for several months at a time in Paris. Larisa added: She added: \u0027I visit her regularly and she is an extraordinary person. I say this not just because I am her grandmother\u0027She said: \u0027Unfortunately, we don\u0027t see each other often, because I can\u0027t leave Oksana. We meet about two times a year.\u0027We talk on the phone every day. Usually, we meet in Moscow or somewhere abroad. However, her grandmother travels more frequently. She flies to Paris a lot and stays there for a month or two.\u0027Her beaming grandmother said the model is always respectful and courteous and has not had her head turned by the star-status afforded her.She added: \u0027I visit her regularly and she is an extraordinary person. I say this not just because I am her grandmother.\u0027Her children are incredible too. Her eldest son Lucas always accompanies his mother. Her daughter Neva attends ballet classes. And her husband Antoine is also very nice. They dine together traditionally and the children are always engaged in the conversation.\u0027I really enjoy visiting them and my husband Viktor, who passed away 5 years ago, loved it too. The model has five children three with Justin Portman, 39, who is half-brother of the Viscount Portman, who she married in November 2001 and split from in 2011.She later began a relationship with Antoine Arnault, the CEO of mens\u0027 clothing brand Berluti. They have two sons Maxim, four, and two-year-old Roman. The catwalk queen is also an ambassador for the World Cup where four matches are being played in her city, including Sunday\u0027s match which saw England thrash Panama 6-1.           Family time: The model has five children three with Justin Portman, 39, who is half-brother of the Viscount Portman, and two sons from her current relationship with Antoine Arnault (pictured) CEO of mens\u0027 clothing brand Berluti But her mother said, despite her international background, marriage to a member of the English aristocracy and relationship with a French man, there was no doubt who her daughter was supporting to lift the trophy in Moscow in July.\u0027I think Natasha will support Russia. She always does. I am not sure though.\u0027Maybe she will also support France now, or maybe England. You know, three of her children are English, two are French, and she is a Russian, that is why it\u0027s hard to tell.\u0027We talked about the World Cup yesterday. She is amazed by the results of the Russian team.She added: \u0027There is a joke among Nizhny citizens, that we must thank god for the World Cup, as our city has finally been modernised.\u0027The area around the stadium used to be a horrible place. Now, I often go there to visit my friend, and when I first saw it I didn\u0027t recognise it.\u0027In our district now, most of the roads have been repaired. The government promised to fix the entire street. Many places were planted with trees.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/26/11/4DA4F84D00000578-0-The_ground_floor_flat_in_the_town_of_New_Cumnock_East_Ayrshire_i-a-44_1530009377476.jpg","title":"Two bedroom flat hammer just 5 000 does need huge renovation","story":"    A two-bedroom flat is set to go under the hammer for just £5,000 on Thursday - the same price as a second-hand Ford Fiesta          The ground floor flat, in the town of New Cumnock, East Ayrshire, is currently uninhabitable due to water damage after a catastrophic flood from a burst pipe in the flat above          Similar flats in the area would normally sell for about £30,000, so the discount price is a stealAuction House Scotland said it is a perfect investment for a builder or developer who wants to make that first step into property investment without having to spend a fortune.The damage is just superficial, the pipe that burst contained clean water and both this flat and the one above have mostly dried out.But it will need new carpets and the new owner will have to check for any warping of the woodwork and kitchen counters and repaint.The flat in Cairnhill Place has two bedrooms, a living room, kitchen, bathroom and hallway.It is in a block of four flats and there are communal gardens at the front and back of the building.   Auction House Scotland said it is a perfect investment for a builder or developer who wants to make that first step into property investment without having to spend a fortune          But the flat will need new carpets and the new owner will have to check for any warping of the woodwork and kitchen counters and repaintMandi Cooper, from Auction House Scotland, said: \u0027For somebody who is a new investor or wants to try getting into the development of property at this low end of the market you are not going to lose out by trying at this level. \u0027Lots of people want to get into property development but the cost has become out of most people\u0027s remit so this is an ideal opportunity for someone to see if they want to do it.House prices in Sydney still have another three YEARS to...‘Secret’ New York island that was a smuggler’s haven during...Your identity can be stolen — every time you hand over your...Share this article\u0027The work needed is very cosmetic.

Tunnels were also upgraded and Blast Doors and Air Locks installed to bring the complex up to full Nuclear Bunker statusThe cost of the Drakelow Tunnels facility was estimated at £285,000. By early July 1942 work was well behind schedule and costs had risen to £983,000. Shortly before that date, the Rover car company was selected as the user of the factory.Rover were at the time manufacturing engines for the Bristol Aeroplane Company.The cost to complete the factory was estimated at a further £184,000 Rover\u0027s requirements included acid-resistant floors and specially painted walls in production areas.

In fact, Tehran’s cosmopolitan art scene is booming, with Sotheby’s selling $1.6m in Iranian art in one 2017 sale and Sotheby’s Dubai selling an Iranian painting for $459,000 soon after. Auction houses have also seen record-breaking sales at Bonhams, Christie’s and Sotheby’s with over $15m sold in Iranian art. While visual artists can’t make explicit comments about certain authorities or touch upon certain themes, they manage to work it to their advantage in ways musicians, comedians and the film and TV world cannot. Two art exhibitions – one in Los Angeles, the other in New York – have recently opened one which dispels the misconceptions around Iranian culture, stereotypes and taboos, while the other offers a window into the lives of Iranian women. Both offer insight into how Iran has changed from the past to the present, and perhaps what the future might hold.Southern California is home to more than 300,000 Iranians, the biggest Iranian population outside Iran. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art recently opened In the Fields of Empty Days: The Intersection of Past and Present in Iranian Art, a group exhibition featuring 125 works of art by 50 Iranian artists, including manuscripts from the 16th century, 19th-century photographs and art made during the Islamic revolution in 1979. “I joke that it’s a show about time travel,” said Linda Komaroff, curator of Islamic art at Lacma. “The concept is how Iranian artists manipulate time, as the historical artworks in the show reveal how artists used the past to update it into the present day.”There are portraits of Iranian world leaders by Afsoon, a London-based Iranian artist, from her 2009 series Fairytale Icons, which poses questions around Iran’s political future. “As a child I was told many fairytales of beautiful princesses and brave heroes,” says the artist. “I believed in fairytales. My chosen icons lived expectantly, hoping, wishing, dreaming. They were loved, admired and fulfilled many of their hopes and dreams. But what happened, did these fairytale icons really live happily ever after? And if not, what chance do we have of a fairytale ending?”There are political parodies by Siamak Filizadeh, who uses symbolism to reinterpret Iranian history, and a series of cartoonish video portraits of Iranian women by the New York artist Shoja Azari. There is also a striking pink self-portrait by the Paris-based artist Malekeh Nayiny called All in Pink, a piece that’s presented as an unconventional way of addressing one’s own personal demons.“It’s about supplying visual info to an American audience to read more and learn more about Iran,” said Komaroff. “When you think of what Iranian art might look like, it might be old-fashioned, or what you see in media coverage, but there really isn’t that it’s exciting visual imagery that could be in any contemporary art show but it’s clearly different. The stories artists share are not based in western knowledge.“The goal is to portray the ideas of identity, politics, faith, history and culture, which help define the remarkably erse artistic heritage of Iran,” she adds, “viewed through the lens of time.”Over in New York, a photo exhibition focuses on Iranian women in Iran: Women Only, which runs until 23 September at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. The solo exhibition features photos by the Bronx-born photographer Randy H Goodman, who was the first foreign female photojournalist to cover Iran in the 1980s. “The photos show an aspect of Iranian society often limited to females only,” she says. It focuses on two periods in US-Iran relations the US embassy takeover in 1980 and the signing of the Iran nuclear agreement in 2015, both of which Goodman covered. “Looking back to understand the socio-cultural changes happening today in Iran provides insight not only about Iranian women, but also other aspects of Iranian society,” said Goodman from her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Her first trip to Iran was in 1980 when she was 24, and she returned in 2015 to find some of the same women she initially photographed. “What happened to these women?” she asks. “It was hard to get the story behind the story out.”The photos also document how Tehran has changed from a barren city to a real estate boom sprinkled with retail. “The city is sprawling,” said Goodman. “There are women on the streets with dyed hair and scarves pushed further back on their heads and they’re wearing designer clothing.”In the exhibition, there’s a shot of a female taxi driver driving a women’s taxi, which transports women safely, while providing work for war widows, orcees and other women who need to support their families. While female taxi drivers started in Tehran in 2006, more and more women are also becoming bus drivers.There’s also a shot of a subway car for women only, which provides optional seating for women, as well as a bleak shot of praying women from the 1980s. “Things were more colorful in 2015 when I returned,” said Goodman. “There was multi-colored clothing, it seemed more stylish, it was a lighter atmosphere, as well.”Even though Tehran can feel like a time warp to the past, Goodman notes its evolution. “Tehran has evolved into a European-like city with high-end shopping malls, social media and luxury cars,” she said. “I thought it was a valuable insight in a time when the US and Iran might be getting past some of the prior conflicts that riddled their relationship in 1953.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb2e60329e5bda3934c6305b3fd24791c2cdd8ec/0_0_2100_1640/master/2100.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dfd0e94dff920d9320bdae17b269f0e1 960w","title":"brexit uk economy june trade","story":"Each month we look at key indicators to see what effect the Brexit process has on growth, prosperity and tradeThe FTSE 100 tumbled over the course of last month amid mounting fears over a global trade war triggered by Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. The president refused to exempt the European Union (including the UK), Canada and Mexico from steel and aluminium tariffs on imports from outside the US, while threatening $200bn (£151m) of additional tariffs on Chinese imports. The news rocked global stock markets as investors grow increasingly concerned over the actions, with the FTSE 100 losing more than 100 points in the past few weeks. Falling exports of machinery, pharmaceuticals and aircraft contributed to Britain’s trade in goods deficit unexpectedly ballooning by £2bn to £14bn in April from the month earlier. Economists had forecast the gap between what Britain imports from the rest of the world and sells overseas would shrink slightly. Taking into account trade in UK services, as well as goods, over the three months to April, the total trade deficit widened by £1.9bn to £9.7bn. The UK’s dominant services sector expanded more quickly than expected in May, according to the most recent data published over the course of the last month, in a sign that Britain could have come through the worst of this year’s slowdown. The latest snapshot from the IHS MarkitCips UK Services PMI showed activity in the sector, which includes banks, restaurants and hotels, recovering to a three-month high. The construction and manufacturing sectors also recorded stronger-than-expected growth. Tax rises might be around the corner to fund Theresa May’s pledge to increase NHS spending by £20bn a year by 2024, yet the latest figures from the UK public finances show public sector borrowing falling further than expected. The budget deficit – the gap between income from tax and government spending – fell to £5bn in May from £7bn in the same month a year ago, beating economists’ forecasts. There was also a revision for the 2017-18 financial year by the Office for National Statistics, showing borrowing came in £1bn lower than previously thought.

Can the burgeoning Instagram- and tech-friendly tiny home movement help solve it?Ryann Flanagan is a teacher at a Montessori school in Austin, Texas. She’s 28 and living with her dad to save money while she looks for a place to buy, but “Austin is super expensive”, she says. Driving to work one day she admired a tiny model home tucked below a sprawling oak tree. A colleague recommended she contact James Stinson, the developer of Constellation ATX – a 6.2-acre tiny home community offering long-term leases on “micro-estates”. “In a micro-estate, you don’t just get your own little yard and your own little house, but you also get a community,” says Stinson. “We want to give people that are traditionally renters an option to come and put down some roots.”  Ostensibly in answer to this conundrum, tiny home communities – the term “tiny home” usually refers to a home of under 500 sq ft – are a growing presence in cities across the US. In Arizona, the Vail School District is building one for teachers who otherwise can’t afford to live in Vail, a community 25 miles southeast of Tucson where the median home price is $257,500. In the UK, construction of “micro-homes” smaller than 400 sq ft has more than doubled since 2010 – 8,000 were built in 2016, according to a Which? analysis of Land Registry data. Constellation ATX is the first US tiny home community to offer residents a 99-year leasehold estate, a sort of hybrid real estate that falls somewhere between renting and buying and overcomes a common problem associated with tiny homes – namely, where to put them. Austin and many other cities ban accessory dwelling units with wheels or require prohibitively expensive permitting. To ensure compliance, Constellation currently only allows houses from pre-approved suppliers, including Colorado-based Sprout Tiny Homes and Kasita, an Austin-based manufacturer of hi-tech tiny homes with price tags starting at $89,000 (about twice the average cost of a similarly sized traditional manufactured home). Stinson believes Constellation’s biggest selling point is the way it is integrating community into the development, which will include a pool and a 5,500 sq ft clubhouse, a communal kitchen and a rooftop patio. “People are moving to Austin from all over the world. A lot of them don’t know people,” he says. “This is a housing development that is focused around that socialisation aspect as well as the small house aspect.”This vision meshes with the reasons people give when they buy tiny homes – they want to eschew the material accumulation of things for something sparser and more focused on experiences rather than possessions. But are tiny homes a durable solution to the affordable-housing crisis, or are they a passing trend and simply making a virtue out of necessity? Even so, Shih says, Constellation’s monthly leasehold fees – starting at $725 – aren’t all that affordable: trailer parks at comparable distances to downtown Austin charge rents closer to $500 a month. But most tenants at trailer parks are on year-long leases. If the park owner decides to redevelop the land – or to raise rents to keep up with property tax increases – tenants have little option but to move, often at considerable cost. When Aaron Berman and his wife, Meredith, moved from Denver to Austin, they decided they wanted to live in a tiny home. “We wanted to get out of commercialism, of materialism,” says Berman. So they designed a tiny home and parked it in the backyard of the winery they owned. They loved living there, save for the constant threat of code enforcement – their tiny home was on wheels and prohibited by Austin’s zoning code. “We lived there for two years and then our daughter came along,” says Berman. “My wife said, ‘I can’t do this, I want a real place for her to grow up in.’” That’s precisely the concern of James Young, senior managing director at ARA Newmark in Austin. He’s considering developing a tiny home community on a 10-acre parcel of land he owns in south-west Austin after a young couple looking for a place to put their tiny home contacted him about his property. “What we learned is that people don’t currently own a tiny home, but they like the concept,” he says. But he thinks tiny homes are inherently transitional dwellings, where iniduals or couples live for three to five years while they save money. “I think it’s going to be handy for people who are looking for a short-term fix to affordability,” he says. “I don’t know how long the demand will last.”  The question remains: are tiny homes really all that affordable? Berman doesn’t think so. “It’s almost like buying an old car – financially it doesn’t make sense,” says Berman. “You’re talking about a lot of money, and you’re talking about a small market where you can resell it.” And like a car, a tiny home is a depreciating asset – research shows tiny homes don’t grow in value like traditional homes, in large part because they’re often not attached to land, the most valuable resource in a city like Austin. Kasita has built units made to be stacked as multifamily dwellings in low- to mid-rise developments on small plots of land, encouraging density in otherwise unaffordable areas. “We’re not going to solve the land issue,” acknowledges Jeff Wilson, the founder of Kasita. That question falls to local and state governments. Austin is currently rewriting its zoning code to encourage density, which could enable homeowners to put tiny homes in unused backyard spaces and rent them out, adding affordable units in desirable areas. The city is also considering putting a $300m housing bond on the ballot in November to fund affordable housing. Some activists would like the bond to fund public land acquisition for future affordable housing developments.For now, developers like Stinson have to build outside city limits, only exacerbating the city’s sprawl and crowded roads. Constellation itself is fairly dense, with 83 units on 6.2 acres (traditional single-family home developments are about half as dense, with four to 10 units per acre). “The problem with Austin and why it’s so expensive is because the development process takes so long that we could never actually catch up with the demand that’s moving here,” Stinson says.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9a86ddf2b76c7913394523f7c0b4db3569c225f/158_382_1321_792/master/1321.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfbd8c6647c5cde81830ced1c71277d9","title":"rising seas florida climate change elizabeth rush","story":"Sea level rises are not some distant threat for many Americans they are very real. In an extract from her chilling new book, Rising, Elizabeth Rush details how the US coastline will be radically transformed in the coming yearsIn 1890, just over six thousand people lived in the damp lowlands of south Florida. Since then the wetlands that covered half the state have been largely drained, strip malls have replaced Seminole camps, and the population has increased a thousandfold. Over roughly the same amount of time the number of black college degree holders in the United States also increased a thousandfold, as did the speed at which we fly, the combined carbon emissions of the Middle East, and the entire population of Thailand.A teenager, wrists lined in aquamarine beaded bracelets, rubs sleep from her eyes. Returns her head to its resting position in her palm. The man seated behind me roots around in his briefcase for a breakfast bar. No one raises a hand.“In the ocean,” Hal continues. “That heat is expanding the ocean, which is contributing to sea level rise, and it is also, more importantly, creating the setting for something we really don’t want to have happen: rapid melt of ice.”A woman wearing a sequined teal top opens her Five Star notebook and starts writing things down. The guy behind her shovels spoonfuls of passionfruit–flavored Chobani yogurt into his tiny mouth. Hal’s three sons are perched in the next row back. One has a ponytail, one is in a suit, and the third crosses and uncrosses his gray street sneakers. The one with the ponytail brought a water bottle the other two sip Starbucks. And behind the rows and rows of sparsely occupied seats, at the very back of the amphitheater, an older woman with a gold brocade bear on her top paces back and forth.A real estate developer interrupts Hal to ask: “Is someone recording this?”“Yes.” The cameraman coughs. “Besides,” Hal adds, “I say the same damn thing at least five times a week.” Hal, who is in his early seventies and has been studying sea level rise for over 40 years, pulls at his Burt Reynolds moustache, readjusts his taupe corduroy suit, and continues. On the screen above his head clips from a documentary on climate change show glacial tongues of ice the size of Manhattan tumbling into the sea. “The big story in Greenland and Antarctica is that the warming ocean is working its way in, deep under the ice sheets, causing the ice to collapse faster than anyone predicted, which in turn will cause sea levels to rise faster than anyone predicted.”According to Marco Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, rising sea levels are uncertain, their connection to human activity tenuous. And yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change expects roughly two feet of rise by century’s end. The United Nations predicts three feet. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates an upper limit of six and a half feet.Take the 6 million people who live in south Florida today and ide them into two groups: those who live less than six and a half feet above the current high tide line, and everybody else. The numbers slice nearly evenly. Heads or tails: call it in the air. If you live here, all you can do is hope that when you put down roots your choice was somehow prophetic.But Hal says it doesn’t matter whether you live six feet above sea level or sixty-five, because he, like James Hansen, believes that all of these predictions are, to put it mildly, very, very low. “The rate of sea level rise is currently doubling every seven years, and if it were to continue in this manner, Ponzi scheme style, we would have 205 feet of sea level rise by 2095,” he says. “And while I don’t think we are going to get that much water by the end of the century, I do think we have to take seriously the possibility that we could have something like 15 feet by then.”It’s a little after nine o’clock. Hal’s sons stop sipping their lattes and the oceanographic scientist behind me puts down his handful of M\u0026ampM’s. If Hal Wanless is right, every single object I have seen over the past 72 hours – the periodic table of elements hanging above his left shoulder, the buffet currently loaded with refreshments, the smoothie stand at my seaside hotel, the beach umbrellas and oxygen bars, the Johnny Rockets and seashell shop, the lecture hall with its hundreds of mostly empty teal swivel chairs – will all be underwater in the not-so-distant future.One of the few stories I remember from the Bible vividly depicts the natural and social world in crisis. It is the apocalyptic narrative par excellence – Noah’s flood. When I look it up again, however, I am surprised to find that it does not start with a rainstorm or an ark, but earlier, with unprecedented population growth and God’s scorn. It begins: “When human beings began to increase in number on the earth.” I read this line and think about the 6,000 inhabitants of south Florida turning into 6 million in 120 short years. “The LORD saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become.” I think about the exponential increase in M\u0026ampM’s, Chobani yogurt cups and grande lattes consumed over that same  of time. The dizzying supply chains, cheap labor and indestructible plastic. “So God said to Noah, ‘I am going to put an end to all people, for the earth is filled with violence because of them.’” And then the rain began.I do not believe in a vengeful God – if God exists at all – so I do not think of the flood as punishment for human sin. What interests me most is what happens to the story when I remove it from its religious framework: Noah’s flood is one of the most fully developed accounts of environmental change in ancient history. It tries to make sense of a cataclysmic earthbound event that happened long ago, before written language, before the domestication of horses, before the first Egyptian mummies and the rise of civilization in Crete. An event for which the teller clearly held humans responsible.Dig into geologic history and you discover this: when sea levels have risen in the past, they have usually not done so gradually, but rather in rapid surges, jumping as much as 50 feet over a short three centuries. Scientists call these events “meltwater pulses” because the near-biblical rise in the height of the ocean is directly correlated to the melting of ice and the process of deglaciation, the very events featured in the documentary footage Hal has got running on a screen above his head.He shows us a clip of the largest glacial calving event ever recorded. It starts with a chunk of ice the size of Miami’s tallest building tumbling, head over tail, off the tip of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Then the Southeast Financial Center goes, displaying its cool blue underbelly. It is a coltish thing, smooth and oddly muscular. The ground between the two turns to arctic ice dust and the ocean roils up. Next, chunks of ice the size of the Marquis Residences crash away then the Wells Fargo Center falls, and with it goes 900 Biscayne Bay. Suddenly everything between the Brickell neighborhood and Park West is gone.The clip begins again and I watch in awe as a section of the Jakobshavn Glacier half the size of all Miami falls into the sea.“Greenland is currently calving chunks of ice so massive they produce earthquakes up to six and seven on the Richter scale,” Hal says as the city of ice breaks apart. “There was not much noticeable ice melt before the nineties. But now it accelerates every year, exceeding all predictions. It will likely cause a pulse of meltwater into the oceans.”In medicine, a pulse is something regular – a predictable throb of blood through veins, produced by a beating heart. It is so reliable, so steady, so definite that lack of a pulse is sometimes considered synonymous with death. A healthy adult will have a resting heart rate of 60 to 100 beats per minute, every day, until they don’t. But a meltwater pulse is the opposite. It is an anomaly. The exception to the 15,000-year rule.From 1900 to 2000 the glacier on the screen retreated inward eight miles. From 2001 to 2010 it pulled back nine more over a single decade the Jakobshavn glacier lost more ice than it had during the previous century. And then there is this film clip, recorded over 70 minutes, in which the glacier retreats a full mile across a calving face three miles wide. “This is why I believe we are witnessing the beginning of the largest meltwater pulse in modern human history,” Hal says.As the ice sheets above Hal’s head fall away and the snacks on the buffet disappear, topography is transformed from a backwater physical science into the single most important factor determining the longevity of the Sunshine State. The man seated next to me leans over. “If what he says is even half true,” he whispers, “Florida is about to be wiped off the map.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e424859bd120b2ca40c991c8a21e6c2e4739be2/0_324_5108_3065/master/5108.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a5f93edb3cd13831274419b159da913","title":"mini holland schemes have proved their worth in outer london boroughs","story":"First formal study into their impact finds that boroughs with the schemes have boosted walking and cycling ratesThe so-called mini-Holland schemes – much-debated changes to boost cycling and walking in outer London boroughs – have done precisely that, according to the first formal study into their impact.The research found that after one year, people living in parts of such boroughs were, on average, walking and cycling for 41 minutes a week more than those living in comparable areas.Among the most notable elements of the study, led by Dr Rachel Aldred of Westminster University, is that while the schemes were primarily billed as seeking to boost cycling, the bigger increase in active travel came on foot – an extra 32 minutes weekly on average, with nine more minutes by bike.The research, published on Tuesday in the journal Transportation Research, studied the travel patterns of just over 1,700 people in three mini-Holland areas – Waltham Forest, Enfield and Kingston – and in various other outer London boroughs which have not seen such changes.The mini-Holland schemes were announced by Boris Johnson in his second term as London mayor, as an outer London adjunct to the new wave of separated “cycle superhighways” he began to build in the centre.The mini-Hollands included some separated lanes on main roads, but also other interventions such as systems to make certain streets access-only for motor vehicles while maintaining through routes for bikes.This made them arguably even more controversial than superhighways, with noisy early opposition including a demonstration outside Walthamstow town hall, and a failed judicial review attempt in Enfield.One of the main objections was the idea the mini-Hollands would benefit cycling at the expense other other modes. But Aldred’s study says: “We found no evidence of this. For instance, there was no evidence that time spent in cars was increasing (due to congestion), nor that walking environments were becoming less attractive due to the introduction of cycle lanes.”There was no significant reduction in overall car use in the mini-Holland areas compared with elsewhere. However, those in the boroughs experiencing the new scheme showed a change towards more positive public attitudes to cycling.It also found the changes seemed to be consistent across demographic and socioeconomic groups, going against another complaint from opponents, that cycle schemes tend to be disproportionately used by white, middle-class travellers.The paper does seem to show that a certain level of action is needed for the effects to be shown – the effects in “high-dose” mini-Holland areas, which had directly experienced change were notably stronger than “low-dose” neighbourhoods elsewhere in the borough.Aldred, who will continue to study the schemes, said it was notable to see such an impact in the first year of operation: “This includes new uptake of cycling, not just existing cyclists riding more. “It is also important to note that while the schemes are sometimes perceived as being ‘for cyclists’, they are encouraging more walking – in fact, the increase in walking is greater in absolute terms than the increase in cycling.”Dr Will Norman, who is in charge of cycling and walking under London’s current mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the mini-Hollands programme – now rebranded “Liveable Neighbourhoods” – had proved its worth.“This study is further proof that our mini-Holland programme is already making a big difference,” he said. “The fact that more people are choosing to cycle and walk more often brings huge benefits, not only to the health and wellbeing of inidual Londoners but also to the wider community. I’m proud that the programme is giving all boroughs the opportunity to bid for funding to make similar positive changes to their areas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1581a86fbefcae9adb1586fe87c075bb7a73bb8f/0_213_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8837aa28f186b24489d791744a868dc","title":"red deer isle rum scotland in pictures","story":"A team of six scientists has descended on Rum, a small island in the Inner Hebrides on the west coast of Scotland, to catch red deer calves.

But this season it has been given multiple seals of approval by the fashion pack, and is naturally (ooh!) the perfect fabric in which to style out hot and sticky weather. It can also bridge the gap between smart and casual: Albus Lumen’s zip-detailed shirt is meeting-approved chic, while Raey’s beige button-front skirt is a great example of a piece that can be dressed up or down. SCIt’s not impossible to wear white in winter. But it can feel a little challenging on the psyche. The LWD is short, usually cotton or linen, and usually with a little twist (a little broderie-anglaise, a little embroidery. If the little black dress is sexy, then the short white dress is more … prairie?

As dresses go, it’s not staggeringly practical, so wear something around your waist on the bus to avoid marks. MFFor the past few summers, slides have dominated the high street. Understandably so: they are ideal for the heat, to throw on, or wear with socks. Still, they remain absolute hell for people who want their feet to look elegant. Thankfully, a new strain has emerged that barely look like slides, while still definitely being slides. These include leather ones in lilac from Zara, woven ones from Topshop, pebble-friendly ones from Ancient Greek sandals or the ultimate ones: souped-up hotel slippers from Balenciaga. Happy feet etc. MFKeeping things straightforward is central to successful heatwave dressing, which is why the jumpsuit has pull-on-and-go appeal. Luckily, they are everywhere this season: on the high-street, Asos and Mango both have great styles that are appropriate for work, weekends and weddings, while Norma Kamali at Net-a-Porter has excellent evening options. The main thing is to choose a lightweight and breathable fabric – we’re thinking linen (see above), not latex – so that you airily saunter, rather than awkwardly squeak, down the street.

You could start\u0026nbspan article on the news pages with that same line but they fit on the sports pages too because these are turbulent times for our football. It was not always like this. For many\u0026nbspyears, football made up for our\u0026nbsplong political, social and economic decline.There is no identifiable moment when it all started, nor one place where it began, and there is no dominant theory. What is true is that bit by bit we got further away from the ball, the one thing we loved\u0026nbspmore than the game itself. We\u0026nbspgot further from a style that used to draw us to the stadium, where we longed to shout “olé!” every time we saw someone dribble, trick an opponent, tease them every time we saw a lightning one-two or some expression of cunning, that astuteness – that was our life. There was talent of the highest quality and in the greatest quantity and we allowed ourselves an act of genius once in a while.Football matters to us it allows us to feel like we are among the best in the world at something with huge popular significance. Its relevance is such that, to give but one example, through football we thought we had recovered the Malvinas in 1986 thanks to Diego Maradona, a national hero ever since. So the disaster of the national team leaves us with a feeling of neglect and emptiness that is hard to explain. How are we supposed to know what to do with football if we\u0026nbspdon’t even\u0026nbspknow what to do with Lionel\u0026nbspMessi?Let’s go back to the start. The street was always our school, which had the great virtue of teaching us the trade, giving football a cultural weight and developing and celebrating players who were different. But the street as a formative stage has gone and no one has known how to replace it with an educational model like those in countries such as Germany or Spain. We always had too little money, organisational ability and vision – and, in our arrogance, too much confidence in our status as a predestined footballing power.On top of that, an imperious, almost delirious need to win overcame the enjoyment of playing. The desire to win at all costs sweeps away your values. Dividing the world\u0026nbspinto winners and losers is an\u0026nbspillness that infected football at a\u0026nbspformative stage.At the same time a passion for football was overcome by a passion for a team, as if a society that has become ever more inidualistic needed something to reconnect it with tribal feeling. Turning clubs into mini-nations constructs an identity, a community that must be defended as a matter of life and death. In the stands violence took over on the pitch, we said goodbye to the olés and welcomed in a world where huevos – balls – are more important than talent.We saw that against Croatia. People were shouting at the players to show more huevos and sitting in the stands Diego expressed that by grabbing his testicles. Yes, Diego: the man who represented better than anyone else the best of what we had, our former style. That desire to fight turns every game in the Argentinian\u0026nbspleague into an indecipherable swarm like an ants’ nest, where someone kicks it and everyone runs more than they think,\u0026nbspand where in the middle of it all it can be hard to work out who the\u0026nbspgood player is.There are other variables in the equation: economic crisis, institutional chaos, televised football as a political weapon, corruption at all levels among those who run the game. The world did not help either: globalisation made us an export economy in which any player, however mediocre, is three goals away from being sold abroad. This premature escape, our footballing diaspora, saw us lose one of the great\u0026nbspteachers: emulation. Maradona is a purely Argentinian product Messi is a mix of his origins in Argentina and his development and completion in Barcelona.Nor do I want to overlook something of great importance: the mediocrity of the debate, where a base crassness more suited to bad actors than good journalists bastardises the play and denigrates players. This infernal racket conditions everything, a deafening noise that surrounds everything and made the Argentinian people believe that if Messi does not win a World Cup he will never be Maradona that made Messi himself believe it.Thirty-three titles later, Messi has taken that message to heart and when the World Cup starts he becomes a tortured soul who carries the fierce demands of 45 million people on his shoulders. And yet it’s not true: Messi has defended Argentina’s footballing pride like no one else for 15 years now and he has done so with an astonishing, scandalous consistency. But that perception became received wisdom and Messi is treated as if he was any old player by journalists who demand an excellence from him they cannot even dream of.In Russia, it has all come together. The crisis of talent. (Did we really only find out on the day Croatia put three past us that we do not have anyone comparable to Luka Modric or Ivan Rakitic?). The lack of leadership. (Is there really no one around the national team who can shake them out of it with words worthy of the impending crisis?) The vulgarity and paucity of the debate. (Have we really forgotten what it was that made us great?) We have to evolve and after the tournament we must begin a revolution in education that can return our lost prestige. We have the genetics that can help us, a history that can propel us, a pride that will give us energy and strength. But education requires time, not haste, and in Argentina we have all lost patience and calm. How can we come up with an urgent solution with problems of such magnitude?As we wait to play Nigeria, the team appear lost, the rumours about internal conflicts spreading, and no one knows what is going on inside the head of Messi – one of the best-known men in the world but whose silences no one can interpret. If Argentina think their problems will be resolved by appealing to courage and fight, their emotional and footballing collapse will follow and with it their discipline. We will finish\u0026nbspthe third game with someone\u0026nbspsent off, a red card to add to the disaster.The decline begins with culture, and we have to recognise the lads gave all the huevos the fans demanded. But huevos are not enough. To wear down a team like Iceland, to overcome a great team like Croatia and to confront Nigeria’s\u0026nbspsense of adventure, we will\u0026nbspneed all the qualities and the values that Argentinian football has\u0026nbsplost along the way. Skill, quality,\u0026nbspfantasy, cunning, precision\u0026nbspwe need to bring that together in a style that can create a collective conviction, an identity, capable of turning this disparate group into a team. Not even a genius can make up for so many failings. Still less, a genius who\u0026nbspis dispirited.Jorge Valdano scored for Argentina in the 3-2 win over West Germany in the 1986 World Cup final and managed Real Madrid 1994-96"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/144025ef1bfcefb59f4cffa2aa2469cfc1feb7bb/13_223_4650_2791/master/4650.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a48d65f89a11091292a09ae96f9ad57e","title":"gareth southgate harry kane england belgium","story":"• Manager hints he may rest captain to give others playing time• ‘Harry knows the team is the most important thing’As England’s footballers continue to rewrite the way they are perceived around the world, from the Spanish sports daily Marca dubbing Harry Kane “the Hurricane” to La Gazzetta dello Sport in Italy noting “a security and spectacularity that historically they never usually have”, Gareth Southgate has been encouraging his players to soak it in and enjoy the moment. It was time, according to the manager, to “get the music on and have a couple of beers”.Only a couple, mind. Zaliv, the one nightclub in Repino, is open late only on Fridays and Saturdays and not, perhaps, a typical haunt for England’s players, given Frankie Boyle’s description of it on his BBC documentary before the tournament as “last orders at your cousin’s wedding”.The team chose instead to stay at their hotel, toasting their early qualification for the last 16. And why not when they are even getting praise, of sorts, from an old enemy? “It is time for all of Scotland to be afraid,” according to the Daily Record, which noted England would regret it for ever if Southgate – “a bit of a dry lunch, but so what?” – did not get his hands on the “big lump of glorious gold almost winking in their direction, beckoning them to step forward and claim it for their own”.At which point it is probably worth reiterating that England’s victories so far have come against moderate sides and, to be picky, that Southgate’s men have not managed a clean sheet in either match, with some legitimate misgivings about how they might cope at the back against more efficient opponents.England can certainly be emboldened by the fact they have won their opening two fixtures for only the third time since 1950, that the team are playing with energy and effervescence and that Kane, in particular, seems absolutely determined to leave his mark on this tournament.Kane’s five-goal haul against Tunisia and Panama would already have been enough to win the Golden Boot outright in 1962 and jointly with Miroslav Klose in 2006 and Thomas Müller in 2010. He is one short of Mario Kempes’s winning total in 1978, Paolo Rossi in 1982, Gary Lineker in 1986, Totò Schillaci in 1990, Hristo Stoichkov and Oleg Salenko in 1994 and Davor Suker in 1998. Kane gives the impression he is as driven by these awards as Cristiano Ronaldo, so much so that Southgate wondered whether his captain might “have the hump” for being substituted against Panama. For Kane, it is almost an obsession to see his name at the top of the scoring charts.All of which might warrant a delicate conversation if Southgate, as he appears to be leaning, has any plans to leave Kane out of the match against Belgium on Thursday that will determine which of the two teams, both already qualified, goes through as Group G winners.That suggests Southgate is contemplating keeping him back for England’s first knockout tie, either in Rostov on Monday or Moscow the following day. Kane, of course, has let it be known he does not want a rest. Yet Southgate has also said that his priority is to look after some of the players who have not featured so far and, more than once, he has mentioned “the harmony” of the group. Steven Gerrard once referred to the England camp as a “five-star prison” and, behind the gates of the team hotel, Southgate is aware of the potential for the non-playing members of his squad to start feeling down and that, in turn, to create problems.Belgium will definitely make widespread changes, with Eden Hazard and Romelu Lukaku among the players expected to be rested, and in Southgate’s case there are four outfield players – Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Gary Cahill and Trent Alexander-Arnold – who have not played a single minute. Dele Alli hopes to be fit again and Kieran Trippier will be closely monitored after being substituted, as a precaution, against Panama.By the time the game kicks off, England will also have a much better idea of the pros and cons of finishing first or second and the best route to avoid a potential quarter-final showdown with Germany or Brazil. It may work out better in the long run to go through as runners-up in a group where England and Belgium are currently separated only by their bookings count. Nobody, however, should believe England, currently top, will go to Kaliningrad with the specific intention of surrendering that position.“For our country, that would be a very difficult mindset to have,” Southgate said. “We want to win every game of football we go into. I don’t know how we would go into a game not wanting to win and play well, so I think that’s dangerous territory if we start trying to plot and predict where we might end up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/711fb1d093bc33b17020e606d55cf1e32c025ae6/0_220_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0223edc10261c9a3f7219754a09c4a4","title":"danny ings exit liverpool summer injury blighted time anfield","story":"Danny Ings has taken the difficult decision to seek a move away from Liverpool this summer as he aims to relaunch a career that has been blighted by injuries throughout his time at Anfield.There is no real desire within the club’s hierarchy to part company with a striker who has become a useful squad player under Jürgen Klopp, but the 25-year-old craves regular first-team football and recognises he will struggle for game-time on Merseyside. He will depart with Liverpool’s blessing.Ings’s desire to prove himself under Klopp had seen him reject prospective moves in each of the last three transfer windows in which he has been fit and available for selection, with interest having been expressed by Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham, as well as his former clubs Burnley and Bournemouth.There will be suitors from Premier League clubs this time round too but, intriguingly, interest also from abroad. Internazionale are believed to be monitoring his situation, while a trio of Bundlesiga clubs – RB Leipzig, Schalke and Bayer Leverkusen – could also formalise their pursuit of his services. Ings will depart reluctantly, but retains ambitions to prove himself at the highest level and a desire to regain a place in the England setup. It is a sign of the strength of the relationship between player and manager that Liverpool are unlikely to price him out of a move away.The £6.5m signing from Burnley has seen his time at Anfield horribly interrupted by two serious knee injuries, but he recovered sufficiently to make 14 appearances last term for the Champions League finalists, scoring once in a 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion in April. He has worked extensively with a personal trainer over the current closed season to ensure he will be fit and ready for the new season – Liverpool actually return to pre-season training next Monday – and has two years to run on his current contract.Ings was capped by England, under Roy Hodgson, against Lithuania in October 2015 before damaging his anterior cruciate ligaments in Klopp’s first training session as Liverpool manager. He suffered a further ligament injury at the start of the 2016-17 season and, as a result, did not actually start a Premier League game between October 2015 and April 2018.Yet his desire to force a way into contention at a club boasting mouth-watering attacking options saw him reject chances to leave where others, including Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi, sought loan moves to rekindle their careers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9e095240902644450d47f23bcd9e8d38257a779/0_69_4388_2633/master/4388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da886256c49dddd4c54b1b136db4bce9","title":"jorge sampaoli argentina world cup back on track","story":"• Coach says he has been made to feel like a ‘criminal’ • Lionel Messi’s mother reveals he cried after Croatia defeatAfter five days of soul-searching that has seen everyone from Diego Maradona to Lionel Messi’s mother have their say on where it has gone wrong so far for their team, it was left to Jorge Sampaoli to put things in perspective on Monday. “The week was difficult after the defeat,” the coach admitted. “Tomorrow the World Cup starts for Argentina.”Yet, if you had believed the reports, the man who led Chile to the Copa América in 2015 might not have even been in charge as his side prepare to face Nigeria in St Petersburg knowing that only a victory can keep alive their hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages.Speculation that Sampaoli had been sacked in the early hours of the morning after the devastating 3-0 defeat to Croatia – and that players had demanded Jorge Burruchaga, the general manager and a 1986 World Cup winner, should take over – were angrily dismissed by their FA’s president, Claudio Tapia, who accused the media of “hurting the national team”.Javier Mascherano also attempted to defuse any suggestion that they had demanded Sampaoli ditch his favoured three-man defence in an attempt to improve the service to Lionel Messi, who has yet to score in Russia. “The relationship with the coach is totally normal,” he said on Monday. “Obviously, when we feel some discomfort or we see something, we express it to him because otherwise we would be hypocrites.”Unlike for the opening draw against Iceland and the loss to Croatia, however, Sampaoli decided against revealing his hand 24 hours before kick-off, claiming he had yet to inform the players of his team but that it is “in his head”.“The way the match was structured against Croatia didn’t suit Messi,” the coach said. “We’ll try to make it better and hope that he will be able to receive the ball a lot more.”Maradona, who coached Argentina to the quarter-finals in 2010, has been among Sampaoli’s chief critics this week, accusing the 58-year-old of “lacking a plan”, but also blaming Tapia for a failure to plan ahead that has seen the country’s previously all-conquering youth sides fail to qualify for several recent major tournaments.While Messi escaped his ire, the captain’s mother also revealed in an interview with Argentinian television that her son “suffered and cried” after the Croatia defeat. “His dream is to win a World Cup. It’s what he wants the most,” said Celia Cuccittini.His 31st birthday on Sunday was marked by a peck on the cheek and a pat on the back from Sampaoli before training, amid reports he had been one of the instigators of the revolt, while down the road in Bronnitsy – a small town 30 miles to the southeast of Moscow that is Argentina’s base in Russia – there was another celebration going on. Known as the farthest point of Napoleon’s advance after the fall of Moscow in 1812, local residents arranged a party in honour of the Barcelona forward that featured a 60 kilogram life-size chocolate sculpture of their hero as its centrepiece. A team of five workers at had worked for nearly a week to produce it before being distributed among supporters.In response to the rumours about his position, Sampaoli said: “The week went from low to high, and with respect to what was said, I cannot clarify things that did not exist. They make you feel like a criminal because you lost a game.”He has a contract until 2022 and with the Argentina FA in severe financial difficulties, would usually expect to lose his job if they are eliminated. But against a resurgent Nigeria – who in November beat Argentina 4-2 in Krasnodar – they face a difficult task. “The two teams are going to try their best to qualify, which makes it a very attractive match,” Sampaoli added. “I am convinced that we have a big opportunity to make it through.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92b51f2bf635eed8c131cd1031d74bcf0b756e35/0_85_3011_1807/master/3011.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b1f75c65b33f86a07ed28df8fbbcd78","title":"world cup best game argentina romania usa 94 hagi","story":"Every football fan will have their own favourite World Cup game but this five-goal thriller takes some beatingBy Craig McCracken for Beyond The Last ManAsk a thousand football fans about the greatest match of their lifetimes and be ready for a thousand different responses – none of them the right one. There’s really only one sensible and rational answer. This particular accolade should belong, unequivocally, to the last-16 game played at the 1994 World Cup between Romania and Argentina. Here’s why you should think so too.Let’s start with the nuts and bolts behind a remarkable game played at an unremarkable stage of the competition. Romania had qualified for the knockout stages by topping their group and catching the eye with their dazzlingly telepathic counter-attacking play. By contrast Argentina had just squeezed through by the skin of their teeth as a third-place qualifier, yet still approached this tie as favourites thanks to their historical pedigree and heavyweight reputation.The billing of the game as Maradona v the Maradona of the Carpathians (as Gheorghe Hagi was known in certain quarters) lost one of its headline acts three days before the fixture in Pasadena when Diego was expelled from the tournament after testing positive for banned stimulants. Claudio Caniggia was also unavailable, but Argentina could still name an enviable makeshift attack that featured the brilliant Serie A-based pairing of Gabriel Batistuta and Abel Balbo.Romania coach Anghel Iordanescu had selection headaches too. He chose to replace suspended forward Florin Raducioiu with the deeper-lying Ilie Dumitrescu, scorer of nine goals in his previous eight internationals. This would prove an inspired move and an early example of a false nine tactic in action. After 11 minutes, Dumitrescu’s curling free-kick from near the touchline deceived Argentina keeper Islas and flew in to the goal, replicating a goal scored by Hagi against Colombia in the group stage.Batistuta equalised with a penalty five minutes later, but Romania regained the lead within two minutes when Dumitrescu cut through the middle, released Hagi on the right and carried on his run to meet the perceptive return pass and side-foot home at the near post. Only a desperate goal-line clearance by Caceres stopped Dumitrescu from completing a first-half hat-trick after another brilliant counter-attack.Romania did extend their lead in the second half around the hour mark, when Selymes broke down the left and squared the ball to Dumitrescu who flicked it into the path of Hagi. The talismanic forward scored with a glorious rising shot to make it 3-1. Argentina attacked desperately and pulled a goal back on 75 minutes when Prunea couldn’t hold a Diego Simeone drive and Balbo fired home the rebound. Romania survived a frantic ending and held out for a famous win that them further in the World Cup than they had ever been.Five goals, world-class footballers at their peak and a match in the balance right until the final whistle suggest this was a thriller, but they don’t necessarily scream out classic of our times. So what marks out this particular fixture as one that transcends all others? The incredible pace and intensity of the game despite the blisteringly hot conditions, the exceptional technical quality on display from both sides and the fascinating tactical battle between two canny managers who were employing radically different styles.Argentina adopted a tight and compact 4-4-2 system with the ball moved quickly and accurately by Redondo, Simeone and Ariel Ortega into positions for strikers Batistuta and Balbo to explode into life. Romania adopted a formation akin to a 4-6-0, outnumbering Argentina in midfield and swarming forward on the counter-attack when they won back the ball, swapping positions and bewildering defenders with their movement. This was a perfect storm of two teams coming together to create 90 minutes of utterly sublime and mesmerising football: a compelling nexus of pace, intelligence, exemplary technique and tactical execution.These were the two best team performances during the entire 1994 World Cup and sadly it meant that one team had to return home at an unduly early stage. Iordanescu was clear about what the performance and result meant for Romania: “This is the greatest event celebrated by our people since the revolution. It’s also the greatest moment in our soccer history.”Maradona, by now working as a commentator for Argentinian television, was unable to see past the pain of early elimination and his own paranoia. “Romania didn’t beat us on the pitch,” he said. “We were beaten off the pitch and that’s what hurts.” Let’s hope that in his quieter, more reflective moments Maradona now realises that there was no disgrace in narrowly losing out in this most epic of football matches.• This article appeared first on Beyond The Last Man• Follow Craig McCracken on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a32cd5a3720e8cc39dd53fe7d1e6dea923f10e04/0_188_3894_2337/master/3894.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0506403f641b6240c75a7b13ecf7be80","title":"world cup 2018 groups c and d get set for finales live","story":"Paul Pogba chose a typically understated means by which to look ahead to France playing Denmark.

Rob Emsley emails in from lovely Newquay with a suggestion of how to liven up England v Belgium, the game that nobody, least of all Spanish Bob, seems to want to win. “Hello there, John Brewin. Have you considered the solution for Thursday that England and Belgium consent to switching ends and each attacking their own goal, thereby treating us to a spectacle of a properly fought-out game with the added bonus of goalkeepers who wouldn’t be allowed to handle the ball?”More on footballers being nice in real life. Presumably, this is isn’t Sir Gareth’s actual brother in law. Here’s  Australia reporter Christopher Knaus, who is in Sochi as a Socceroos fan, with a taste of the atmosphere ahead of the match with Peru.It’s a tense atmosphere for Australian fans in Sochi this morning. The green and gold of the Socceroos is noticeably outnumbered by the red and white of the Peruvians, who are in typically high spirits despite being out of the tournament. All week, Peru flags have been raised atop the cabanas along Sochi’s main waterfront strip, which looks out to the Black Sea. The Peruvians have packed out the bars and restaurants since the weekend, and break out in spontaneous singing and dancing on the beaches. Fans are just beginning to leave for the hour or so drive out to Fisht Stadium, part of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics complex. The Peruvians are confident. I haven’t met a single one who doesn’t ardently believe they will smash the Socceroos and go home with pride. When the World Cup and the transfer window collide. Belgium midfielder Marouane Fellaini had said he will reveal on Sunday whether he stays at Manchester United. “I know where I will be playing next season and I will announce it in the coming days,” said the Low Countries’ answer to Antoine Griezmann and Lebron James. “I’m at the end of my contract and I want to be free in my mind. That’s why I’ll be announcing it next week.” Asked if he would reveal those plans on Sunday, July 1, he replied: “Yes.” Arsenal fans: get ready to celebrate your new signing...More on Pepe then off-field charmer from Robert Lowery. “Your anecdote about Pepe being a decent guy when not acting like a complete $*#@ on the field speaks to a nugget of wisdom I am fond of rolling out.

Which of the Class of ‘92 is the sound one or who from the current England team would make a good brother in law? A friend of mine was even more stark in this regard. He reckoned that it takes such abnormal ego to make it to the very top that anyone looking at a player and saying “Yeah, we’d be mates” was probably making a losing bet.”The Nationalmannschaft’s most famous fan will not be attending Germany’s match with South Korea in Kazan.

A personal view: it’s made what might have been rubbish games into some highly amusing spectacles. And there’s plenty more where that came from.This was a truly excellent game. Who needed Maradona when you had Hagi? How about those Golden Boot standings? Cristiano Ronaldo might have been level with Harry Kane had he not missed that penalty last night against Iran.The Uruguay v Portugal match last-16 tie set for Saturday looks set to be true a VAR nasty, and brings back memories of the 2006 World Cup match, played at the same stage of the competition.It ended 1-0 to Portugal in Nuremburg, but the real scoreline was in the collection of two red cards each and 16 yellows overall. The image of Barcelona team-mates Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Deco sat with each other on a stadium step watching the game play out is indelible but here’s a picture of them doing battle on the pitch and our report from that night. Nobody wants to see football played like that until the chaos descends.After the glory of their opening two matches, Russian fans took losing to Uruguay pretty hard. Andrew Roth reports. And on the home front, here’s some Liverpool news. Roberto Martínez has been speaking ahead of England v Belgium.Asked whether English players had improved technically, he said: “Very good question. I think it’s been a huge evolution. When I started in the Premier League in 2009 it was a real contrast in styles in the league, but I think the English players have developed an incredible awareness from a tactical point of view. That’s been the biggest difference in the last five or six years. Having St George’s Park, having a real structure in the way England teams play, you’ve seen the success with the Under-17 teams, and the Under-20s, the way there is a winning culture, and probably I would say in the last six years the English players have now got that intensity and the real pace, but with a real tactical awareness, that is brought by the way teams are playing in the Premier League.”Kári Tulinius emails in. “One moment from yesterday that I found quite touching, but hasn’t gotten much attention, was seeing Pepe, of cartoonish football villainy fame, console an Iranian player (Pouraliganji, I think, but I’m not sure). It was a lovely, humane gesture from a source not normally associated with lovely, humane gestures.”I am told, by friends who have spoken to him on a regular basis, that Pepe is actually a really nice bloke. My own interaction with him is limited, but when it comes to turning down a chat in a mixed zone there are few more polite in delivering their rebuffs.Anywhere, here’s an image to perhaps change some minds. There have been some cultural issues Down Under. From elsewhere in the world of football, Suzanne Wrack has news on Sheffield FC. Spain got lucky last night against Morocco and they know it. Somehow, they managed to top Group B and will face Russia in Moscow on Sunday. AS and Marca had identical headlines declaring: “Long Live VAR!” Consummate diplomat Sergio Ramos is asking for everyone to cool their boots, while admitting that there is much to be ironed out. “We got through and won the group, that was the objective, but the game wasn’t good at all for us, it’s a night for everyone in the squad to take a look at themselves, we need to get ourselves into gear,” the Kop’s pariah said. “There’s no need to panic, but we do need to evaluate ourselves generally and inidually, we can all contribute more and be more balanced defensively and solid so we can make the difference in attack.” Defence looks to be Spain’s biggest problem, judging by their three group matches. “When you play in a team that causes so much damage in attack you have to be a little more careful, that’s what makes the difference, we need to be more solid, there’s no margin for error now, one mistake will throw you out,” Ramos said. “We prefer to do our talking on the pitch and I hope we can have a great game against Russia, who have been playing at a very high level. I hope we can impose ourselves on them, we need to show who we are as soon as possible.”All you hip young gunslingers who use Instagram should sign up to the  Sport account for great stuff like this. David Squires’ latest is here for your amusement and delectation. David Penney emails in. “One reason I love the World Cup is to discover great players that I previously was unaware of.

Here’s where pride can be salvaged, in the style of Saudi Arabia’s defeat of Egypt on Monday. Their goalscorer in the 6-1 defeat to England, Felipe Baloy, who will be retiring from international football after the match, has been talking. “We’ve studied Tunisia, who are a difficult rival, but still it is an opportunity to achieve a historic win,” he said on Tuesday. “The experience in Russia has been top-notch, we hope that Panama can keep growing. As a group we’ve had a good coexistence in which we’ve spent time with the youngest players, who will stay on.” Morning all, let’s begin this session with a quiz. “What happened next?” was always the best round of Question of Sport.

Thanks for your company, and your emails. GoodbyeIt’s Denmark v France at 3pm BST today and the French press have added a bit of needle by dragging up some pre-tournament quotes from Åge Hareide. The Denmark insists his comments were taken out of context, but could the fact he said France were “nothing special”, they lacked a “leader such as Zinedine Zidane” and Pogba only cared about his haircut come back to bit him?

To play or not to play is the conundrum for the waist-coated one: Mark Pearson reckons that it’s not the on-field referees who are to blame for the VAR fails, it’s their fully-kitted friends in the studio. Don’t hate the player, hate the game is the general gist of his email:“In defence of the referee (not something I ever thought I’d say) last night, he got the decision right in the first instance. He was then told by a team of officials with access to multiple replays that he should have another look, which inevitably plants the suggestion in his mind that he got it wrong. From the replays we were shown at home, angle A made it look like a handball (it looked like it dropped straight onto his arm rather than being headed against his arm), where as angles B, C, D, etc, made it very clear that it was accidental. For some reason, the poor ref was only shown the same few frames from angle A again and again, rocked back and forth with the ball hitting the arm. Based on the evidence he was shown, it looked like a stonewall penalty. So the fault is with the guys in the VAR room, not the ref. Another example of VAR poorly implemented.”Des Kelly begs to differ …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/811f0c5b74163acc6ae6e708a92ed10a7475ae54/1061_270_882_529/master/882.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=236ffd2021e1d5f231f399d916afee40","title":"demi lovato review o2 arena london","story":"O2 Arena, LondonVulnerable but resolute, the singer pursues her ‘truth’ in an affecting and revelatory showPostponed from earlier this month owing to ailing vocal cords, Demi Lovato’s first headlining London show generates considerable anticipation. In the intervening fortnight, she’s landed her first UK No 1 with the Clean Bandit collaboration Solo, and released a surprise standalone single, Sober, which reveals a recent relapse after six years’ abstinence from alcohol. Tonight she performs it on a darkened stage, under a spotlight that picks out only Lovato and her grand piano – a fitting end to 90 minutes of candour and bloodletting, teen-pop style.In the UK, the 25-year-old is the least well known of the former child actors who got their start on the Disney and Nickelodeon channels before maturing into pop brands. If she lacks the name recognition of Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, she makes up for it in openness: here, Lovato appears to be vulnerable but resolute, and it would be a flinty onlooker who wasn’t at least a little swayed by her commitment to telling “my truth”.Accordingly, there’s a video of a self-administered pep talk (“We all have a story, we all have to deal with the feeling of being alone”) and she subsequently illustrates “aloneness” when she rises through the stage floor and sings You Don’t Do It for Me Anymore under a single spotlight. It feels not showy but brave it also presents a gratifying expressiveness to her skyscraping vocals. Lovato can belt with the best of them, and does on the stormy ballad Warrior and the giddy pop hit Cool for the Summer – the latter featuring tame erotic interplay with a female dancer to underline its bi-curious theme. Tonight, though, the soaring vocals are balanced by softness and nuance. Levity has been built in, too. In a video, she plays both a therapist and her patient, and later a “kiss cam” roving the crowd encourages couples of all genders to canoodle. Lovato herself, dressing-gowned and perched on a double bed, notes that she’s looking for a European boyfriend. “Or girlfriend,” she quickly adds, the imperfect, likable Lovato telling her “truth” as she sees it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7374d66ede3cb980124d8fc5969e270b0260b1d/0_287_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c28a5e1231486ca17d601a04ba95467","title":"the turn of the screw review britten opera eno regents park open air","story":"Regent’s Park Open Air theatre, LondonThis superb production creeps into every corner of the outdoor space, as the battle for children’s souls intensifies Britten in the park? A ghost story in an outdoor setting on a perfect summer’s night? It sounds improbable but this joint venture between the Open Air theatre and English National Opera works superbly well and, in the second half, you even feel a chill to the spine as you watch a battle for possession of children’s souls in the gathering dusk.It helps that Timothy Sheader, as director, and his designer, Soutra Gilmour, know how to use the space. Bly, the remote country house at which a governess arrives to take charge of the children, Miles and Flora, is here seen as a dilapidated conservatory surrounded by mounds of unruly grass. The action also erupts around the whole theatre. The prologue is sung by William Morgan from the front stalls. Peter Quint’s night-time summons to Miles takes place from the auditorium and the blanched figure of Miss Jessel stalks the side aisles. Even the orchestra, glimpsed behind an upstage wall and excellently conducted by Toby Purser, takes on a ghostly quality.Debate still rages as to what Britten’s opera, with a libretto by Myfanwy Piper based on the 1898 Henry James novella, is finally about. Are we watching the governess’s attempt to rescue the children from the corrupting clutches of the ghostly Quint and Miss Jessel? Or could the ghosts be projections of the troubled mind of the governess herself? The latter has become a fashionable interpretation, but Sheader’s production left me feeling that we were watching a genuine contest with forces of evil. Without disguising the governess’s complexity (like Quint, she says of Miles, “You shall be mine”), Anita Watson powerfully makes her a woman driven more by moral anxiety than by luridly subjective fantasy.Britten’s rich score is full of strange echoes: as Humphrey Carpenter points out in his biography, the governess’s musical identity is surprisingly tied up with that of Quint. Yet Sheader’s production, without being heavy-handed, unequivocally suggests this is an opera about child abuse. Miles and Flora, from the start, seem dangerously knowing. Mrs Grose, the housekeeper, tells the governess that Quint “was free with everyone”. The key moment, however, comes in Quint’s night call to Miles. The expressive features of the extraordinary Daniel Alexander Sidhom light up as he hears Quint’s voice, strips off his clothes and dons a purple shirt replicating that of the ghost. The intimacy between them is underlined when, as Miles plays the piano, Elgan Llŷr Thomas’s Quint sinisterly turns the pages.Two casts share the roles during the week’s run: the first night one was impeccable. Elen Willmer as Flora, precisely echoing the gestures of Elin Pritchard’s Miss Jessel, imply their bond is as strong as that of Miles and Quint. Janis Kelly, who has sung every female role in the opera, makes Mrs Grose a memorably troubled figure: not the conventional homebody, but a woman who palpably loves the children and who at one point clutches a pillar in fear for their safety. It’s a fine production that gathers in intensity as darkness falls. But it struck me that the real villain of Britten’s opera, as of James’s story, is the children’s unseen : it is he who, by his negligence, commits the ultimate crime of leaving the innocent to their terrible fate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec995f4462b955c3909ee372618a5a30467dd7d6/99_34_2796_1678/master/2796.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cbeb3856e1cf2741a292fb3c461e3585","title":"worcester install more cooling stations horse racing prepares heatwave british horseracing authority","story":"Worcester will have extra cooling stations available at Wednesday’s meeting when the course hosts the first afternoon jumps meeting since the current heatwave began.The abandonment of racing at the Midlands track in 2009 after horses collapsed with heat exhaustion was the first time a meeting in Britain had to be called off owing to high temperatures. Worcester’s clerk of the course, Jeremy Martin, told the Racing Post: “To put it simply, we’ll be having more buckets of water available and more cooling down stations than usual.”There were problems at Cheltenham this year when the course took the unprecedented decision to call off one of its races after officials concluded the three‑and‑a‑quarter‑mile distance was too extreme on one of the hottest April days on record. The decision followed the death of a runner after crossing the line in the opening race.Measures to assist runners in the conditions were in evidence at Southwell on Monday after the clerk of the course, Roderick Duncan, announced that “horses won’t be coming into the winner’s enclosure to assist us in cooling them down and to enable ius to get plenty of water to them”.Temperatures are expected to peak in midweek but the hot weather is forecast to last until into next week with National Hunt fixtures at Cartmel and Uttoxeter also scheduled over the next few days.The British Horseracing Authority has a detailed list of instructions for tracks, trainers and jockeys with measures to alleviate the effects of hot weather which are sent out when temperatures start to approach 30C.The BHA will also be releasing a video this week to highlight the work they do to alleviate the risks to horses and riders during heatwaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98e332f161ab101a3b2f40ba30bb726800a3edc8/402_197_2583_1550/master/2583.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=085a3986786553ecca3359124b2059dd","title":"county cricket lancashire v hants yorkshire v surrey and more live","story":"For some reason the Surrey twitter feed isn’t showing Mark Stoneman’s wicket.Scarborough: Yorkshire 342 (Tattersall 70 Dernbach 4-104) v Surrey 89-2 (Burns 54 not out)Old Trafford: Lancashire v Hampshire 398-8 (Rossouw 95 not out Onions 5-78)Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 115-3 ( Khawaja 26 not out Procter 2-13 ) v Northamptonshire 281 (Wakely 82 van der Gugten 5-45)Super think-piece by Andy Bull on Steve Smith in this week’s Spin.

So helpful were IBM’s machines that Hitler awarded a special medal to the company’s CEO, Thomas Watson, in recognition of his services to the Third Reich.This shameful episode in IBM’s history highlights an uncomfortable predicament for companies pursuing lucrative government contracts, and one that’s recently reared its head for Google, Microsoft and Amazon: should they be held accountable for how their customers deploy their technologies?The question has come to the fore for Microsoft, after it was revealed that the company’s Azure cloud computing arm was working with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). The relationship was announced in January, when Microsoft said it was “proud to support” Ice’s work with secure cloud services and facial recognition and identification. However, it came under scrutiny this month as the ugly results of Trump’s zero tolerance border policy, which saw thousands of children separated from their parents and detained in cages, unfolded.For Microsoft’s executives, the deal marks an important expansion into a lucrative government market. Employees saw it differently, and hundreds signed an open letter to Microsoft CEO’s Satya Nadella demanding the company end its $19.4m contract with Ice and create a policy not to work with clients who violate international human rights law.“We believe that Microsoft must take an ethical stand, and put children and families above profits,” they wrote. “As the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit.”It’s easy to think of “the cloud” as a neutral bank of computers to which Ice has bought off-the-shelf access in the same way any business can buy cloud storage, laptops, smartphones or accounting software. We don’t blame Apple if an Ice agent is tipped off about an undocumented worker via a call to his iPhone, so what’s the big deal with Microsoft selling cloud services to the agency?Serving the specific needs of a client like Ice, including supporting facial recognition and real-time translation of voice audio, would require a highly customised infrastructure with state-of-the-art data processing abilities, she explained. This means Microsoft engineers dedicating their time to build and maintain tools that help catch and deport immigrants.Even if there were no customisation, Microsoft is complicit, argues Nicholas Evans, an assistant philosophy professor at UMass Lowell, who has studied the complicity of psychologists in torture programmes. “By choosing to take Ice’s business they are saying ‘we think Ice isn’t objectionable enough that we won’t do business with them’,” he said. “This tacit endorsement is problematic for Microsoft.”This is the latest in a series of employee revolts within Silicon Valley.In April, Gizmodo revealed that Google had partnered with the US Department of Defense (DoD) to help the agency develop artificial intelligence for military drone surveillance through a pilot project for the Pentagon’s Project Maven, which seeks to identify objects in drone footage.Staff who had joined a company famed for its search engine and advertising business were horrified to find themselves providing services to the DoD. It prompted a huge internal backlash and dozens of employees resigned.The worker action was effective: Google announced it would not renew its Project Maven contract.Amazon also came under fire for selling a facial surveillance tool “Rekognition”, which can identify, track and analyze people in real time, to various law enforcement agencies. According to Amazon’s marketing material the software can recognise “persons of interest” from a police body-cam video stream.“It’s disingenuous for these companies to abdicate the responsibility for harmful use of their products,” he added. As with Google and Microsoft, the backlash triggered workers to write a letter to Amazon’s CEO Jeff Bezos, obtained by Gizmodo, stating: “Our company should not be in the surveillance business we should not be in the policing business we should not be in the business of supporting those who monitor and oppress marginalized populations”.The backlash marks something of a turning point for Silicon Valley’s tech workers, who have long been lambasted for their lack of empathy for those living outside of their gilded bubble.“It’s taken a bit of effort to get them thinking about the impact of their work and be more aligned with the working class and immigrant populations as opposed to their executives and bosses,” said Ares Geovanos from the Tech Workers Coalition, which advocates for worker rights. As we saw with Google, collective worker action can be particularly effective in companies whose bottom lines rely on their ability to retain highly-skilled computer scientists.“Those engineers collectively have more power than inidual consumers to push their companies to be responsible corporate citizens,” said Evans.Contact the author: olivia.solon@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b68fb0c6f2babc82a103f756fb66e9bc2c5b4503/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6895cee45d2577ca854c3e9c8e71833","title":"from beavis and butt head to pimp my ride which mtv shows should be revived","story":"The once-essential channel is bringing back some of its classic programmes, including Daria. Here’s our dream line-up from its vaultsHaving realised that it doesn’t really serve any purpose in 2018, MTV is getting into the nostalgia business. It recently revealed plans to revive some of its most-loved legacy properties. Daria is coming back, as is Aeon Flux, The Real World and Made. While this is good news – anything that breaks up the wall-to-wall monotony of endless Catfish episodes is frankly much-needed – it doesn’t seem like it goes as far as it should. In its day, MTV was an absolute wonderland of television, and there are so many other shows it could haul back in from the wilderness.For a glorious stretch in the mid-1990s, Beavis and Butthead operated as a sort of MTV Mystery Science Theater 3000. Popular music videos of the day would play out, while a couple of sniggering delinquents sat back and ripped them apart. “These guys are pretty cool for a bunch of mimes,” they said about Kiss. They called Styx “Your mom hanging out in bars again”. Imagine Beavis and Butt-Head retooled to be awful to YouTubers. It would be the only thing I’d ever watch.There were only ever 13 episodes of the blisteringly inventive Clone High – a cartoon about teenage clones of everyone from Lincoln to Gandhi – but the talent involved was impeccable. It was the first big runout for Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who filled both The Lego Movie and the 21 Jump Street franchise with jokes that were originally destined for Clone High. The pair often talk about trying to bring it back. Fingers crossed they succeed.Obviously, nobody would ever produce a straight remake of The Osbournes in 2018, because it’d just about be the saddest television programme in all of history. But the series is so seminal – it essentially invented reality TV as we know it – that it deserves to be commemorated somehow. Remake it with George Osborne’s family?Dear God, the writers this show had. As well as Stiller, the room included Brent Forrester (who went on to write on The Simpsons and The Office), David Cross and Bob Odenkirk (who went on to create Mr Show), Dino Stamatopoulos (who went on to write for everything you’ve ever liked) and Judd Apatow (who went on to become Judd Apatow). A reunion wouldn’t exactly appeal to the youth of today, but it would still be incredible.Jackass hasn’t been on television for 16 years, and you shudder to think what sort of reception it’d get in these censorious times. A show about the simple pleasures of elaborately hurting yourself and others in the name of pure entertainment, it was very much a moment of its time. But perhaps MTV can make a show based on its nearest possible equivalent: an endless loop of lads partaking in the cinnamon challenge. Again, not a great show to bring back as is, since its hosts were a now-notorious anti-vaxxer (Jenny McCarthy) and a man who has just been accused of sexual assault (Chris Hardwick) – claims which he denies – but leave them out of this and you’re left with what’s now, on reflection, a surprisingly wholesome dating show. A British version, for a time hosted by Richard Blackwood and Tess Daly, aired on Channel 5, but it was rubbish.A wonderful television programme that needs to come back in one form or another. The premise was simple – you would give your car to Xzibit and he would remodel it so elaborately that you’d never be able to drive it again for fear of being mistaken for a satanic clown by terrified locals determined to run you out of town – but an enduring one. Bring it back.A 30-minute compilation of shorts from independent animators Liquid Television was the walking definition of hit-and-miss. It could be indulgent and sloppy at times, but it was also the perfect incubator for shows such as Aeon Flux and Beavis and Butt-Head. If MTV handed over a cheap slot to promising new animators today, it’s almost guaranteed that we’d still be talking about some of the results 20 years from now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d173be33218db12c0249537515fe28ea4ebd3f8e/0_0_3002_1802/master/3002.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026s=ca086319461ad426aa6b558065cfb7db","title":"saudi arabia is not driving change it is trying to hoodwink the west","story":"The country has lifted its ban on female drivers, but this is a rebrand, not a revolution. Yet many governments – and media outlets – are being taken inIf I see one more article about Saudi women being able to drive I am going to throw myself under a car. Don’t get me wrong, I am glad Saudi Arabia has lifted the world’s only ban on women driving. But I am also worried. Rather than being a meaningful step towards progress, as much of the coverage suggests, the reversal of the driving ban is quite the opposite. Allowing women behind the wheel is a PR move by Saudi Arabia, designed not to modernise the kingdom, but to render a repressive regime more palatable. Yet many western media outlets seem to be falling for this strategic “women-washing”, as you might call it, hook, line and blinker.The irony of Saudi Arabia jailing women’s rights activists at the same time as it lifted its driving ban did not go unacknowledged by the media. However, the jailed activists were the secondary story. Most headlines have played into the narrative of reform that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has been pushing. This week’s cover of the Economist, for example, read “The Saudi revolution begins”, alongside a cute visual of a niqab with car wheels representing a woman’s eyes. But there is no revolution happening in Saudi Arabia. What is happening is a rebrand.It was reported last year that Saudi Arabia was setting up global public relations hubs to improve its international image amid its bombing of Yemen and its embargo of Qatar. Well, the Saudi PR machine has been very busy indeed. When Prince Mohammed visited the UK in March, he was accompanied by a massive advertising campaign. Messages such as “He is empowering Saudi Arabian women” covered billboards and taxis. They even appeared in the .Saudi Arabia’s messaging points have been regurgitated by the media, too. In November, Thomas Friedman wrote what was essentially a puff piece about Prince Mohammed in the New York Times, titled “Saudi Arabia’s Arab Spring, at Last”. Then, in March, Prince Mohammed appeared on CBS’s 60 Minutes, his first interview with an American television network. “He is emancipating women, introducing music and cinema and cracking down on corruption, in a land with 15,000 princes,” announced the introduction to an extremely softball interview. In the 30-minute segment, only a couple were devoted to Yemen, and these were glossed over quickly. After all, who wants to talk about war crimes and dead Yemenis when you can talk about cinemas and women driving? Particularly when the US and the UK are complicit in Saudi Arabia’s disastrous war in Yemen.That is the salient point here. Ultimately, the celebratory coverage around Saudi Arabia lifting its driving ban is a reflection of the fact that it is in the west’s best interest for the kingdom to be painted in a good light. It is terribly inconvenient, after all, to acknowledge that your lucrative trading partner, whose war efforts you are backing, is an abusive, authoritarian regime. Far better to focus on lovely photos of women in cars.“This feels like one of those flashbacks in The Handmaid’s Tale,” joked my girlfriend as we made our way across Manhattan on Sunday morning, heading towards a gay pride party. “You know, when they’re showing how things used to be.” She was right: New York on Sunday was the antithesis of Trump’s US. Rainbow flags were everywhere and the whole city seemed to have come out to celebrate love at this year’s annual parade. It was wonderful. But, in the current political climate, it was also a little weird. Celebrating pride felt immensely privileged and extremely precarious.At a time when progress can no longer be taken for granted, this year’s pride was an important reminder of just how far gay rights have come. I have been out for 16 years and it is astonishing to see how quickly attitudes have changed in the US and the UK. Pollsters have called the shift in public opinion on gay rights “unprecedented”. In 2015, when the US supreme court ruled in favour of legalising same-sex marriage, President Obama stated: “I know a change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long. But compared to so many other issues, America’s shift has been so quick.”It is generally not useful to argue about which minority has it worst. However, I think it is important to acknowledge “gay privilege”, to recognise that gay rights have leapfrogged those of many other minorities in the west. It is particularly important to remember this now and to ensure that the most privileged members of the gay community, particularly affluent, white gay men, support other oppressed groups. Pride has turned into a corporate festival. Now, more than ever, it needs to be a political protest.This week’s contender for “I can’t believe this isn’t satire” goes to a US startup called Ambulnz. What fresh, stupidly spelled hell is this, you ask? According to its website, “Ambulnz is a new kind of on-demand ambulance services provider”. I thought all ambulances were on-demand, but what do I know? Wait, there is more! Ambulnz is apparently “transforming medical transportation through the use of disruptive technology”, whatever that means. I am still not sure what Ambulnz does, but it has done a brilliant job of straddling the dystopian intersection of the US’s broken healthcare system and Silicon Valley bombast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/623f72fe415abb63a7244ce0b17a56c6e7c04bc0/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e56e8bfa56f2d14d9245e61b48521fc","title":"tobacco indonesia child labour harvest","story":"In a country that is the world’s fifth-largest tobacco producer, children work despite labour lawsAs a young girl, Julaeping Putri loved to play, even take naps, among the fresh mounds of tobacco leaves piled around her home on the Indonesian island of Lombok.Her mother, Nurul Huda, thought nothing of it at the time. She liked having the stacks of leaves there too – a reminder it had been a plentiful, lucrative harvest.From as young as three, Julaeping, or Eping for short, said she would help her parents out in the field, planting the small Virginia tobacco saplings, mixing the fertiliser, watering the plants. In harvest season, Eping and her friends would spend hours after school tying the tobacco leaves on to large poles, getting them ready for the “ovens”, village smokehouses where the leaves are smoked dry for almost a week. Sometimes they would play a game, racing each other to see who could do it the fastest. But it wasn’t always fun. A few times during the harvest Eping felt so ill she collapsed. Her mother, too busy with the yield to take her to hospital, called in the local nurse to give her an injection. In the decade since, her health problems have never really gone away. “Since second grade, I have been sick in the chest, and then sometimes it is hard to breathe,” says Eping, now 14. It’s always worse in tobacco harvest season, she says, especially when they unfurl the leaves from the ovens, when the smell of tobacco is most pungent. “I have felt like throwing up before because the tobacco smell is so strong. It happens often, that you want to keep throwing up,” she says, “After opening up the leaves, I feel sick in the chest and my heart starts to beat very fast.”According to a 2016 report by Human Right Watch entitled The Harvest Is in My Blood, thousands of children work in Indonesia’s tobacco industry, where they are exposed to serious health risks.Based on interviews with more than 130 children, the report notes that symptoms described, such as vomiting and nausea, are consistent with acute nicotine poisoning, caused by contact with tobacco plants and leaves.Green tobacco sickness is a form of nicotine poisoning that workers can be vulnerable to absorbing through their skin, especially if the leaves are wet because of rain, dew or sweat.What are the symptoms? Nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, headaches, and dizziness while farmers are working or several hours after work ends. Symptoms can last 24 hours extreme cases may require emergency help. Tobacco firms say they ban under 18s from hazardous work and only allow them to handle dry tobacco when there is no risk to health.One US study found about one in four workers harvesting tobacco in North Carolina suffered from green tobacco sickness in a single season.Last year Eping’s parents took her to the doctor to find out if her repeated complaint, a tightness in her chest and shortness of breath, was connected to her exposure to tobacco.Her elder brother Jovi, 28, laughs scathingly when asked about the diagnosis. “The doctors here aren’t brave enough to be honest. They don’t say it is related to tobacco but we know,” he says, as he draws on a cigarette himself. “Maybe brave is not the right word. Maybe they are afraid there might be a demonstration.”Tobacco has long been big business in Indonesia. According to research by Euromonitor International, Indonesia produced 269.2bn cigarettes in 2015, while the market was valued at 231.3tn rupiah (£12.4bn, $16.6bn at current exchange rates).Across the country tobacco advertising and smoking is widespread – for Indonesian men, lighting up is considered the uncontroversial norm. Rules are so lax and cigarettes so cheap – one packet is less than £2 – that many start from an early age.With such a large presence, the industry is a powerful lobby in Indonesia and campaigners say it is quick to push back against pressure. In Beleke, residents talk of the financial benefits of tobacco to the village. Next to rice and corn, tobacco is the most lucrative crop but it can only be grown in the dry season, from about May to September.Home to about 3,000 families, the village is spread across fields of brilliant green rice paddies that become replaced entirely with tobacco plants in the growing season.“No one stays home in harvesting season. You find people young and old around the ovens and in the fields. Everyone is collecting money and everyone is happy about that,” says Anggi, 42, a farmer.Almost all the children above the age of four work – some begrudgingly because their parents ask them to, others because they want to earn money.“My daughter helps me in the field, putting the fertiliser on the trees and also carrying the water,” said Anggi. “That is the picture of all the mothers and farmers who have children in the village.”For almost two months during the harvest, carts of tobacco leaves are hauled into the village and the children are called in to help prepare them for the smokehouses, knitting them on to large sticks and getting paid by the stick.Some of the children the  meets talk about what they can get with the money from tobacco work, but they also describe long hours. “I like doing it because I get money,” says Aning, age 12, who first started working six years ago. “I can buy snacks at school, or toys, like a doll. I start after school, from midday until about 5pm. I can earn about Rp 15,000 (£0.81, $1.08) and I do that every day in the season.”Aning’s best friend is only six years old, but last year he worked so hard during the tobacco season that he saved 1m rupiah (£52, $70). “If I keep working in the night, I can get Rp 50,000 (£2.69, $3.60). After praying time at 7.30pm, I work until about midnight,” he says. “School starts at 8 in the morning. So we are often late in the season.”While Indonesian labour laws prohibit anyone under the age of 18 from performing hazardous work, in practice, especially in small-scale farming in Indonesia’s under-developed eastern regions, the laws are often poorly enforced and understood.After it is roasted, the tobacco grown by Beleke’s small-scale farmers is sold to middlemen, who transport it by the ton to one of several warehouses on the island. Mostly it is sold to a warehouse controlled by the Indonesian tobacco company Djarum.One middleman, speaking anonymously, tells the  the company is unaware children are involved in production, but admits that no one asks questions about the issue. Djarum declined to respond to questions about child labour.The five big transnational tobacco companies say child labour was unacceptable and that they were working hard to stop it happening in their supply chain. They said they were encouraging farmers to grow other crops, but added that tobacco gave farms a better income.No one interviewed in Beleke sees it as problematic that children work in the tobacco industry.

They say they have asked her to stop working during harvest.“Sometimes I ask her to stop working, but she is so fast at it and I’m happy with that,” says her mother, Nurul Huda.“And sometimes she just disappears,” she adds, with a shrug. “Every time she comes back carrying money.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3544232.1530011145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dubliners face water restrictions as potential drought looms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDubliners are facing unavoidable water restrictions following a prolonged spell of dry weather. Photograph: ShutterstockDubliners are facing “unavoidable” water restrictions with a potential drought looming following the long spell of dry weather, Irish Water has warned.A yellow weather warning is in place for the rest of the week across the country with temperatures expected to hit 30 degrees in parts of the midlands and west.However, the risk of drought is particularly acute in the greater Dublin area, with demand on water supplies reaching “concerning levels”, according to Irish Water.The utility can produce 610 million litres of water per day to serve the Dublin area. Last summer, an average of 565 million litres of water per day was used. But last Friday 602 million litres of water was used and overnight on Monday the levels were at 609 million litres leaving “almost no margin of supply over demand” Irish Water said.“If the drought is prolonged, water restrictions would become unavoidable given the trends. Irish Water are appealing to the public to be mindful of their water usage, ” Irish Water’s corporate affairs manager, Kate Gannon said.The utility’s drought management team is monitoring daily water supplies and demand, she said.“Our drought management team are monitoring the situation daily across the country and we intend to provide regular updates nationally and at regional level, so that the public is aware of the position as it develops.“This is a very serious situation and we are seeking the public’s help. Every effort the public make to conserve water will help to minimise risk of supply loss to them and their community.”At many of water schemes around the country, supply and demand was already under pressure and the spell of warm weather has exacerbated this situation. Demand for water is increasing while levels in rivers and lakes are dropping significantly which means that is there is less water available to treat and supply to homes and businesses, Irish Water said.At the same time, the sources, especially our main raw water storage at Pollaphuca, is dropping at similar rates to previous droughts in 1975, 1976, and 1995. To minimise the risk of supply failure, we need to conserve water in our sources including rivers, lakes and groundwater and avoid overstressing the production and distribution systems.Already some areas in Athlone, Kilkenny, Longford and north Dublin have experienced outages and restrictions and areas in Donegal and Mullingar have been identified as being at risk, Ms Gannon said.“Irish Water’s Leakage Reduction Programme teams are on the ground now but we also need the public’s support to reduce their water usage. The top three measures that people can take are not using a hose to water the garden or wash cars keeping paddling pools very shallow if they are being used and taking short showers rather than baths.”"},{"url":null,"title":"military veterans struggling adapt civilian life mods tick box2","story":"digitalservices@telegraphMilitary veterans are struggling to adapt to civilian life, a charity has warned, as former service personnel criticised the Ministry of Defence\u0027s tick-box support. Many working-age service leavers feel “undervalued by society and misunderstood by civilians” with the resettlement process failing to address their lost sense of belonging, the study by Ssafa, the Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen’s Families Association, found..  The charity surveyed over 1,100 former service personnel between the ages of 18 and 49, for a new report titled The Nation’s Duty: Challenging society’s disservice to a new generation of veterans. Over three quarters of those polled (77 per cent) - all of whom had sought help from the charity - said they felt they were not fully prepared for civilian life with 19 per cent saying the resettlement package failed to provide them with suitable skills or qualifications to find a job. Sir Andrew Gregory, SSAFA’s Chief Executive, said: “Support for the Armed Forces means more than just supporting them during active duty, it means creating a welcoming environment for them to re-enter when their time is served.”Sir Stuart Peach has said wider society has too simplistic a view of those that had served their country.The report comes in the wake of comments by the outgoing Chief of the Defence Staff, Sir Stuart Peach, who said wider society has too simplistic a view of those that had served their country.“The absolute majority of people who served in the Armed Forces return to fulfilling lives enriched by the experience. We are not all heroes and we are not all broken by service,” he said in his valedictory speech earlier this month.Gemma Morgan, an army veteran, told the : “The military puts huge effort into creating a separate society, a separate fighting force, for good operational reasons,” she added, “but sometimes the real world can be more complicated and there is often a reverse culture-shock and loss of that sense of belonging once someone leaves”.She blames the “tick-box exercise” of resettlement for not properly allowing veterans to create a new sense of purpose after their service. Instead of just writing CVs, those leaving military service “need the space to decompress away from the team to ask ‘who the hell am I?’” says Ms Morgan..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}The infrastructure is there so it’s just the content that needs to changeArmy veteran Gemma Morgan“If you still see yourself as a soldier after you’ve left, you’ll never transition.”“The infrastructure is there so it’s just the content that needs to change. This can be a quick win and we need to start doing it properly for the sake of the veterans.”Speaking exclusively to the , Mark McDonald, a veteran of 23 years service, revealed how he needed help transitioning back into civilian life having been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2005. “Once you leave the gates you’re on your own unless you ask for help,” he said, “and pride can be a problem sometimes.”“My pride got in the way of me asking for a mobility scooter, but my wife talked me into it. Now I can do the shopping or go with my son to watch his football matches.”He was shocked and angry to be told that as a former soldier his local authority wanted to do extra checks as part of his application to foster his son, in case he had been “institutionalised”.“Did they think I’d have my child marching up and down outside the house?” he asked. “Would they do this with a former policeman or ambulance driver?”Ssafa helped Mr McDonald with his financial planning after being medically discharged in 2013. He feels service leavers should receive such help as standard on resettlement courses.“In the military all your bills for food, accommodation and tax come out of your pay before you get it.

We are currently trying to locate the man\u0027s next of kin.The force spokesman gave safety advice for swimming in open water and added that a number of youths had been swimming in the lake and behaving in an anti-social manner.He said: Bodies of water may look safe, but can hide dangers such as hidden currents, hazardous objects, pollution and cold water shock, which affects our ability to swim and reach safety if experiencing difficulties.It can also be difficult to gauge water depth - you could find yourself in unexpectedly deep water or injure yourself jumping into shallow water.Water UK, which represents regional water companies, said heavy rainfall during spring had left aquifer levels robust.However, Anglian Water issued a detailed list of dos and don’ts to prevent waste, including “leaving the sprinkler in the shed this summer”.“Grass is extremely hard to kill - your lawn will soon bounce back and be vibrant and green again,” a spokesman said.They added: “Forget the paddling pool and head to the beach...if you’ve already filled the paddling pool for the day, don’t empty it, you can save loads on your water bill by using gentle disinfectant tablets that keep the paddling pool water fresh for days.”Failing that, Anglsaddlian customers are advised to use the water to “wash the dog”.On Monday, the hottest point of Britain was at Hampton, in London, where temperatures reached 30.1C - making it the hottest day of the year so far.The previous 2018 record was recorded at St James\u0027s Park in central London, which reached 29.1 on April 19.Meanwhile in Scotland, Achnagart in Ross and Cromarty boasted a temperature of 27.5C and the heat hit 25.3C in Castlederg in Co Tyrone, Northern Ireland, on Monday.And high temperatures are expected to be beaten later this week- before dropping off at the weekend.Merseyside is likely to enjoy the hottest weather on Tuesday, the Met Office said, with highs of 31C (87.8F) forecast.Temperatures are set to rise, with a possible high of 33C (91.4F) on Thursday, meteorologist Alex Burkill said, soaring above the UK average for this time of year of 17.3C (63.1F).The fine, hot weather looks set to continue into next month.At the moment it looks like that will be the general theme through much of July, he said. Generally it looks like it will stay drier and warmer than average.Forecasters said the hot weather is being caused by a jet stream looping to the north of the UK which has created an area of high pressure.Click here for more UK weather news.Please review our commenting policyFrench nanny murder: Couple jailed for life after torturing Sophie Lionnet to death in act of \u0026#39horrible cruelty\u0026#39What causes a heatwave and how hot can we expect it to get this week? Scottish Government accused of failing cancer patients as waiting times hit new lowMoped gang chased by builders down London street after muggers attack woman and childA47 crash: Two dead and 18 injured after bus and lorry collide in CambridgeshireJohn Bolton heads to Moscow to discuss Trump-Putin meeting - and possible World Cup visit Prince William asked by President of Israel to deliver \u0026#39message of peace\u0026#39 to PalestiniansDiscovery of earliest European depiction of cockatoo in medieval book rewrites history of global tradeVan driven into front of Dutch newspaper\u0026#39s head officeWorld\u0026#39s first beluga whale sanctuary will re-home animals kept in captivityUnmarked police motorbikes intercept mopeds in ManchesterUS freezes \u0026#39zero tolerance\u0026#39 migrant policy as family detention centres hit capacityHeatwave: what are your rights as an employee during hot weather?Scottish doctors warning over a profession \u0026#39pushed to the brink\u0026#39Navy Seals race to rescue children\u0026#39s football team trapped in Thai caveA simple guide to the customs union and its impact on BrexitPrince William tries his hand in the DJ booth during Middle East tourComment: Jacinda Ardern\u0026#39s family should be celebrated for blazing a trail - and naysayers are just stupid little boysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/26/TELEMMGLPICT000167590865_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"van driven front dutch newspapers head office","story":"digitalservices@telegraphThe police said the act was believed to be intentionalDutch police are investigating after a van deliberately slammed into the headquarters of one of the Netherlands\u0027 top newspapers and media groups early Tuesday, catching fire but not causing any injuries.This morning about 4:00 am a delivery van was driven into the facade of a publishing house in Basisweg in Amsterdam, police said in a statement.The building houses the head office of the tabloid De Telegraaf, the country\u0027s top-selling paper, which focuses on sports, crime and celebrity gossip.The police said the act was believed to be intentional, but no-one was hurt and the driver had fled the scene, most likely in a dark-coloured Audi car. They have launched a manhunt and are appealing for information.The van burst into flames on impact, and fire services were swiftly called to the scene. Television images showed fire officers dousing a huge blaze which had engulfed the white van lodged in the building\u0027s glass-fronted facade.The vehicle went up in flames, causing a large amount of damage to the buildingDawn revealed the area had been completely charred and reduced to twisted metal, and the Telegraaf said it believed it had been a deliberate attack.We will not let ourselves be intimidated, said editor-in-chief Paul Jansen, adding it was too early to speculate who was behind the incident.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said, that while much remained unclear, the incident was a slap in the face to the free press and to Dutch democracy.His government was alert and vigilant, he added in a tweet.De Telegraaf added the van had not been able to penetrate into the building as the front windows were made of special safety glass.But the Dutch news agency reported that a concrete block had recently been removed from the front to allow a construction work, which may have allowed the van to hurtle into the building.Amsterdam mayor Jozias van Aartsen said he had spoken to the prosecution service about possible extra security measures to protect De Telegraaf as well as other media organisations in the Dutch capital.The incident comes after a man fired an anti-tank weapon into another building in the Sloterdijk area of Amsterdam which houses media organisations, including the weekly Panorama.A 41-year-old man has been arrested over the attack last Thursday which also caused no injuries. Police identified the man as a leader of a local motorbike gang.What causes a heatwave and how hot can we expect it to get this week? Scottish Government accused of failing cancer patients as waiting times hit new lowMoped gang chased by builders down London street after muggers attack woman and childA47 crash: Two dead and 18 injured after bus and lorry collide in CambridgeshireJohn Bolton heads to Moscow to discuss Trump-Putin meeting - and possible World Cup visit UK weather: Heatwave causes railway slowdown and wildfires - and it will get even hotter until weekendPrince William asked by President of Israel to deliver \u0026#39message of peace\u0026#39 to PalestiniansDiscovery of earliest European depiction of cockatoo in medieval book rewrites history of global tradeWorld\u0026#39s first beluga whale sanctuary will re-home animals kept in captivityUnmarked police motorbikes intercept mopeds in ManchesterUS freezes \u0026#39zero tolerance\u0026#39 migrant policy as family detention centres hit capacityHeatwave: what are your rights as an employee during hot weather?Scottish doctors warning over a profession \u0026#39pushed to the brink\u0026#39Navy Seals race to rescue children\u0026#39s football team trapped in Thai caveA simple guide to the customs union and its impact on BrexitPrince William tries his hand in the DJ booth during Middle East tourComment: Jacinda Ardern\u0026#39s family should be celebrated for blazing a trail - and naysayers are just stupid little boysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6258776  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/04/15/bitcoin-price-latest-news-update.jpg","title":"bitcoin interest cryptocurrency price gains ing predictions value","story":"Created with Sketch.Bitcoin interest to double, says banking giant ING Cryptocurrency price correlates closely with consumer interestClick to followThe Independent TechThe price of bitcoin tends to mirror\u0026nbsppeople\u0027s interest in the cryptocurrency, with the level of Google searches providing a near-perfect correlation to the virtual currency\u0027s value. This could be good news for investors, as new research suggests that interest in cryptocurrency is expected to more than double.The latest consumer economic report from Dutch banking giant ING\u0026nbsprevealed that fewer than one in 10 Europeans currently own cryptocurrency, however 16 per cent of people expect to own them in the future. Surveying nearly 15,000 people across 13 countries, the Dutch bank said the survey reflects a gradual change in attitude towards cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ethereum and ripple.One of the most surprising findings from the survey was that 15 per cent of respondents said they would consider receiving their salary in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, despite their notorious volatility.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

If cryptocurrency stabilises there may be increased interest.”According to Teunis Brosens, an economist of global markets at ING, cryptocurrency holds the most promise in countries where the traditional financial system is less efficient.We find that the Dutch, with a very efficient and cheap domestic payment system, are most sceptical about the future of digital currencies, Mr Brosens\u0026nbspsaid.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

However, in the first six months of this year, the SMMT reported that investment has “stalled”, with just £347.3m earmarked for new models, equipment and facilities in the UK, which is around half the sum announced in the same period last year.Production output has fallen, due to slowing demand in the new vehicle market, and hundreds of job cuts have been announced, including at Jaguar Land Rover and at Vauxhall dealerships across the UK.The SMMT said the government “government must take steps to boost investor confidence and safeguard the thousands of jobs that depend on the sector”.The group called on Westminster to end uncertainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU, and “commit to continued membership of the customs union and maintenance of the benefits the single market delivers”, or risk undermining the competitiveness of the UK car industry.

information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is

The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.A stronger charge against Orwell might be that of antisemitism.\u0026nbspThe private notebooks that formed the basis of the list he sent to the IRD included labels like “Polish Jew”, “English Jew”, and “Jewess”.But Orwell did also devote an entire 1945 essay to discussing how best to combat antisemitism, while having the honesty to admit – and regret – his own occasional lapses into jokes at the expense of Jews.And at the moment, antisemitism might be a problematic charge for some left wingers to level.Taylor, though, is convinced that some amongst “the newly emergent hard left” would secretly love to unleash something against Orwell.And yes, by “newly emergent hard left”, he does mean some Corbynistas.Younger party members, Taylor concedes, might not have the personal memories of the Cold War, still less an instinctive understanding of the context in which Orwell produced his list in 1949.But, he adds: “I am a Labour Party member.\u0026nbspI have been to hear Corbyn speak and noticed how an awful lot of the people there were aged left wingers for whom there had not really been a place in the Labour Party for the last 20 or 30 years.“An awful lot of the hard left these days would pay lip service to Orwell as a beacon of sanity, while secretly having doubts.“There are still a load of extreme lefties out there to whom Orwell is this snivelling little Trotskyite telling them things they don’t want to hear and pointing out things that shouldn’t be pointed out because they get in the way of the revolution.”And to the ideological, Taylor would add the psychological: “Tall poppy syndrome – Orwell is this secular saint, so let’s have a go at him.”This battle over Orwell’s reputation, of course, is more than just a matter of idle literary historical curiosity.Its relevance to the political struggles of today is suggested by the remark of one of the more ferocious online critics.“George Orwell,” he says, “was the first in a long line of Trots-turned-neocons”.It is certainly true that far-right commentators have started trying to co-opt Orwell to their cause, even to the point of suggesting that the man who once chased a fascist across a battlefield with a fixed bayonet would deplore the Antifa movement.This, says Taylor, is pretty much what Orwell feared.“At the time he was giving Celia Kirwan his list, 1984 was about to be published.\u0026nbspOrwell’s great fear was that right wingers would use it as a piece of anti-communist propaganda, and that’s what happened.\u0026nbspImmediately after\u0026nbsp1984 was published, it was used by the CIA as a propaganda tool.“Orwell wrote a very interesting letter to people in the US saying: ‘Look, this is not so much anti-communist as anti-totalitarian.’“He feared what right wingers would do with 1984, but thought it was the price you had to pay for exposing evils like totalitarianism.“And a writer can’t be blamed for how their books are used by people who are determined to twist meaning for malignant ends.”Taylor, though, can’t help wondering whether Orwell would really have been that upset by the comments of “slightly disconnected people” on the far left of the internet.Orwell himself, he points out, never sought secular saint status.\u0026nbspQuite the reverse: “He was very wary of that kind of thing.\u0026nbspIn an essay on Gandhi he effectively says that when people start being referred to as saints there is something very odd about them and it usually ends in disaster.”Instead Taylor has a sneaking suspicion that Orwell might have been rather amused by his online detractors.“People undervalue Orwell’s wry sense of humour,” he says.\u0026nbsp“David Astor, who used to edit the Observer and employed him, told me about the time Orwell came to him saying, ‘You should hear the abuse I have been getting from some of the communist newspapers.’“Orwell said: ‘They call me a fascist octopus.\u0026nbspThey call me a fascist hyena.“Then he paused: ‘They’re very fond of animals’.”\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Northern Ireland could be given joint EU and UK status and a \u0027buffer zone\u0027 on its border with the Republic, under new plans being drawn up by David Davis, according to reports.The government will propose its plan to avoid a Brexit hard border with Ireland “next month”, the Northern Ireland secretary has said.After a meeting with the EU’s chief negotiator in Brussels on Monday, Karen Bradley said the issue was a matter for “the whole cabinet” and that they would meet to discuss it.The delay means the UK will only have three or four months to discuss its fully-formed “backstop” proposal with Brussels, with the deadline for a deal on withdrawal looming for October.Theresa May is set to travel to Brussels on Thursday for a meeting with European leaders, but little movement on the issue is expected.A previous plan unveiled earlier this month was criticised by Brussels as incomplete. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, said the British proposal would not prevent a hard border and would not be acceptable because of its time-limited nature.Ms Bradley said she was in Brussels to explain “the sensitivities” of the Northern Ireland issue to Mr Barnier. The EU has suggested putting\u0026nbspcustoms checks on Irish Sea ferries between Britain and Northern Ireland to prevent a hard border but Britain has rejected the idea.\u0026nbspTheresa May said earlier this year that “no British prime minister” would agree to such a state of affairs. Senior cabinet sources say the EU plan faces opposition from\u0026nbspministers across the board, while Ms May is under even more pressure to prevent the plan going ahead because she relies on the vote of Northern Irish unionists to have a majority in the House of Commons.\u0026nbspWe’re working across cabinet ... to make sure that we can actually resolve the Irish border\u0026nbspThe prime minister has, in theory, twice committed in writing to preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland but has rejected the EU technical proposal for avoiding it.Speaking to the media after the meeting with Mr Barnier, Ms\u0026nbspBradley said: “It was an opportunity for me, as Northern Ireland secretary, to set out the position in Northern Ireland, the sensitivities in Northern Ireland and the need to make sure that we maintain that constitutional and economic integrity of the whole United Kingdom, and get a good deal for the whole United Kingdom, including the people of Northern Ireland.“We’re working across cabinet on all matters to make sure that we can actually resolve the Irish border and no border down the Irish Sea through the overall UK relationship. That’s what we all want to achieve. But obviously we need to put into legal text those matters that were agreed in the joint report and that’s what we’re working on.”People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchThe cabinet is expected to meet at the prime minister’s country retreat, Chequers, next month to hammer out agreement on the issue.The previous proposal would not have prevented a hard border because it did not align regulations between the UK and the EU.

Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded\u0027Mattha Busby and agenciesClick to followThe Independent OnlineEthiopians at a rally in Addis Ababa in support of the new prime minister, Abiy AhmedAt least two people have been killed\u0026nbspand others injured following an explosion at a political rally in support of Ethiopia’s new reformist leader.In a televised address after the blast on Saturday, which eyewitnesses said was caused by a grenade, Abiy Ahmed described the incident as “an unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united”.He said “a few people have lost their lives” and others were injured in the attack, that came shortly after he spoke to a crowd of tens of thousands of supporters on Meskel Square in the capital, Addis Ababa. Mr Ahmed has not yet blamed anyone for the blast, nor has anyone claimed responsibility, and police are investigating.“Love always wins,” he said. “Killing others is a defeat. To those who tried to ide us, I want to tell you that you have not succeeded.” An Associated Press reporter said they saw more than a dozen injured people. Ethiopians have been heartened by a slew of reforms under Mr\u0026nbspAhmed and had come together in a show of support in numbers unseen in recent years in the east African nation. The rally has now broken up with people singing, chanting and going back to their homes. In a cowboy hat and T-shirt, Mr\u0026nbspAhmed had addressed the crowd in Meskel Square as supporters wore clothes displaying his image and carried signs saying “One Love, One Ethiopia”.Mr\u0026nbspAhmed told the tens of thousands of supporters that change was coming after years of anti-government tensions and there was no turning back. “For the past 100 years hate has done a great deal of damage to us,” he said, stressing the need for even more reforms. The 42-year-old entered office in April and went about introducing a swift package of liberalising reforms which surprised Africa’s second most populous country.He announced the release of tens of thousands of prisoners, the opening of state-owned companies to private investment and the unconditional embrace of a peace deal with rival Eritrea. “I’ve never thought this day will come in Ethiopia. I’m very emotional right now,” said Mulugeta Sema, a supporter of Mr\u0026nbspAhmed who wore a T-shirt with the new leader’s image. “We should never get back to dictatorship. This is time for change.” British man held on death row in Ethiopia for four years releasedEthiopia demands Britain return all country’s artefacts held by V\u0026ampAHowever, not everyone has supported the reforms. Some Ethiopians near the border with Eritrea have protested the embrace of the peace deal. Meanwhile, the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front, the dominant force in Ethiopian government for much of the past 27 years, said the peace deal had been made before the ruling coalition’s congress met to discuss it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

To participate in the state’s primary you must have registered by 5 June. To vote in partisan races, voters had to register as a Democrat or Republican, but other party affiliated voters can cast ballots in nonpartisan races such as those for school boards.\u0026nbspPolling places can be looked up on the Board of Elections site.\u0026nbspThere are several online voting guides to help familiarise voters with issues before heading into the booth. A valid form of identification is required and can be in the form of a state driver’s license, state issued ID card, passport, student or military ID. A current utility bill or pay stub listing your name and address also works. Those without identification can request a provisional ballot, which will be counted once the information is verified. Incumbent Governor Larry Hogan is running for a second term at the helm this year. Though a Republican, he is considered a moderate and worked to put distance between himself and Donald Trump on issues like healthcare and gun control. His popularity is a pleasant surprise for a state that is considered to be largely Democrat and has voted that way for decades in presidential elections. Going against Mr Hogan are eight Democrats. Perhaps the best-known candidate is Ben Jealous, former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People\u0026nbsp(NAACP). He has managed to get endorsement from Senators Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris and is seen as the progressive challenger to established Democrats in the state, part of a national movement this year to make the party more erse, inclusive, and less reliant on corporate contributions which wield influence. However, candidate Rushern Baker polled at a relatively close second. The official from Prince George’s county, which borders the eastern half of Washington DC, has won the endorsement of former Democratic Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley and is seen as having closer ties to the establishment wing of the party. While Maryland is seen as a reliably blue\u0026nbspstate, there is one red\u0026nbspRepublican pocket and Democrats are looking to change that in voting booths along the Eastern Shore part of the state. Andy Harris has been the Republican Representative in the US House for eight years and has not faced a real challenge in that time. Unlike other parts of the state, the Eastern Shore is predominately white and voted for Mr Trump by 29 per cent in the 2016 election. What Mr Harris faces now is not just his vote against Obamacare, and that only 26 per cent of Maryland voters are registered Republicans, but also that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has made his seat a target and throwing political weight behind challengers like Jesse Colvin, a former Army intelligence officer, who has raised a large amount of money. Five other Democrats are challenging Mr Colvin for the nomination. The sixth Congressional district of the state, running from the suburbs of DC to the western border with Pennsylvania is an open US House seat - four Republicans and eight Democrats are vying for it. As far as Senate seats go, well-established Democratic Senator Ben Cardin is running for re-election. Mr Cardin is expected to win, taking 61 per cent in a recent poll, but is still being challenged by first-time candidate Chelsea Manning. The former US Army intelligence analyst who was convicted in 2013 for the largest leak of classified information in history moved to Rockville after Barack Obama commuted her sentence. Though\u0026nbspattention focused on her Senate bid, she has not been able to challenge Mr Cardin’s $4m in contributions and 30 years of experience. Voter turnout in primaries promises to be high across the board, but particularly for Democrats as tensions with Mr Trump and the Republicans grows every day. “Democrats are energised and they’re ready to send a message,” said Fabion Seaton, a spokesman for the Maryland Democratic Party, speaking to the Baltimore Sun. Early voting has seen a 55 per cent increase in turnout over the 2014 primaries, the last non-presidential election. As of last week, more than 170,000 voters had already cast early ballots, but experts warn this is not an indicator of winners since early voting is usually pushed far more by Democrats than Republicans.After the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration failed to send updated voter rolls to the Board of Elections, almost 19,000 voters are required to fill out provisional ballots in order to participate in the primaries. The agencies called it a “computer programming error” affecting any voters who updated their addresses between 22 April 2017 and 5 June 2018, as the Washington Post reported.In total 18,700 changed their addresses and 7,300 changed their party affiliation. There are efforts to contact all voters impacted by the error, but concerns were raised since the problem was discovered only three days before the primary.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

An existing\u0026nbspstate of emergency, they\u0026nbspstressed, also limited freedom of expression and assembly for political parties.The delegation from the\u0026nbspOrganisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)\u0026nbspcomplained that some monitors were obstructed in carrying out their work. Ignacio\u0026nbspSanchez Amor, the group’s special coordinator, said it was “utterly unacceptable” that two members of the team were denied entry into the country.Election in Turkey: the reaction in picturesSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultMr Erdogan described the election process as “an example to the rest of the world”. In his victory speech he returned to a recurring theme in his campaign: that he was the leader to\u0026nbspstand up for Turkey against western powers. “We never bow down in front of anyone except God, you have given a lesson to those who want for Turkey to kneel,” he told his cheering followers. “We will fight even more with the strength you provided us with this election.”Foreign interference and sabotage had been blamed by Mr Erdogan and his supporters for a range of the country’s ills, including the plummeting national currency, the Lira. The president, who had said he would play a key role in forming economic policy in his new administration, declared that vast infrastructure developments\u0026nbspbeing undertaken will lead to massive boosts in employment and growth. The projects include Kanal Istanbul, a 45 kilometre channel linking the Black and Marmara\u0026nbspseas and the airport to replace Istanbul’s Ataturk, provisionally named the New Istanbul Airport, but, it is claimed in local media, which may end up being called\u0026nbspErdogan Airport.The conflicts\u0026nbspagainst Kurdish militants home and abroad are set to continue,\u0026nbspwith new operations planned. The mission was to “fight terrorist organisations” and\u0026nbsp“to continue the fight to make Syrian grounds freer”, Mr Erdogan said. Fresh offensives are also expected to be launched against Kurdish fighters in the southeast of the country. “Our flag will flutter more freely, the peace of every citizen will be advanced,” the president\u0026nbspsaid. “One nation, one flag, one country, one state.”Erdogan proclaimed winner of Turkey’s presidential electionThe pro-Kurdish\u0026nbspPeoples’\u0026nbspDemocratic Party (HDP)\u0026nbspbroke through the 10 per cent barrier in the elections and so\u0026nbspwill have a significant number of MPs in parliament. Nine of its newly elected MPs, including the leader, Selahattin Demirtas, have been imprisoned.\u0026nbspThe HDP\u0026nbspgains\u0026nbspwere expected to make the opposition groups the majority in parliament,\u0026nbspbut Mr Erdogan’s\u0026nbspJustice and Development Party did better than expected as did its allies, the far-right\u0026nbspNationalist\u0026nbspAction Party\u0026nbspwho secured\u0026nbspdouble the support polls had forecast. This means the ruling coalition will keep control.The election wins\u0026nbspkeep 64-year-old Mr Erdogan in office until 2023, the centenary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. He can then, under the new constitution, run for another term as president, and one more if he were to call an early election. Thus\u0026nbspallowing him to stay president, theoretically, until 2032, easily surpassing the tenure of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.During\u0026nbspthe election campaign Mr Erdogan had mooted that the state of emergency, brought in following the failed coup blamed on exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, would be lifted. More than 50,000 people remain in prison and another 140,000 have been suspended or fired from their jobs.Turkey’s democracy isn’t over yet, but it will be soonErdogan declared winner of Turkey\u0027s presidential electionSix arrested for ‘insulting Erdogan’ as polls open in Turkey electionsThe president has not given a timeframe for the easing of the punitive measures or any indication on whether they would be lifted totally.\u0026nbspHis new powers, in any event, allow\u0026nbsphim to impose draconian measures with minimal interference from the judiciary.There were some among opposition supporters who would rather not wait to see whether there would be an outbreak of benevolence from the president after his victory.Adem Bulent, a 20-year-old student and CHP supporter, said he has begun to explore whether he can finish his studies abroad. It was not just the defeat which disappointed him, but the way the political parties accepted it. “They talked about how unfair it was, they talked about vote rigging, then this happens against all the expectations, and then –\u0026nbspnothing,” he said, waving\u0026nbsphis arms in exasperation. “I think the chance has come and gone, there is no point in pretending otherwise.”The extent of the gloom felt by those who expected change\u0026nbspwas expressed by an academic staring into his coffee on Monday morning at a cafe in Istanbul’s fashionable Nisantasi district. Suleiman had stayed up\u0026nbspmost of the night in front of the television with the forlorn hope of the figures changing. “Just how bad was it? Well let’s say for us it was Trump and Brexit rolled into one, that’s how bad it was,”\u0026nbspwas his damning verdict.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

under the cover of darkness - a handful of expert marksmen are deployed each evening.For many, urban foxes are a menace and a pest, growing fat and brazen thanks to the abundance of discarded food they can easily snaffle from bins left outside homes and businesses.As cubs they look cute and dog-like, but many of the predators end up bristling with disease and capable of maiming pets and people.Jodie Nailard, 22, was savaged as she slept last week when a fox entered her London home via the open patio doors.Thats why licensed pest exterminators like Tom Keightley have taken up arms and started working as hired guns for homeowners who are willing to pay hundreds for their back-garden fox problem to be taken care of by the time they wake up. Tom, who is based in London, has 40 years of experience in the fox-shooting business, and he says his lethal - but legal - methods are the most humane way to deal with urban fox infestations.Tom kills around six foxes in a typical night, and charges around £450 for a call-out fee, plus between £25 and £75 per fox killed - depending on the location.He gets at least three calls a week from clients all over the UK.I get called for a number of reasons and one of the most popular ones is the concern about small children being attacked, Tom, 61 tells Sun Online.I seem to be getting more calls - and its only increasing. Im assuming thats because there are more foxes out there.Every shot is a head-shot. I dont shoot anywhere else on the body - even though I could kill them, they could run off elsewhere and may not die instantly, he says.Theres a part of the brain called a Medulla Oblongata- its the brain stem. The idea is to shoot at an angle that hits that and cuts their motor.Wherever possible, I shoot from a first-floor window in the house. There was an occasion when the lady didnt want me inside, so she made me sit in a Wendy house, which was a bit embarrassing.Foxes dont have protected legal status, so its not an offence to shoot them - provided you have the landowners permission and the relevant firearms licence.Some other methods of killing, like using poisons, are illegal however.The RSPCA urges homeowners to use non-lethal deterrents instead, claiming that shooting urban foxes does nothing to prevent others from taking their place.Local councils warn that you are responsible for the costs of killing and disposing of a fox if you employ someone to kill one.Even cooped up in a playhouse, Tom would cut an intimidating figure.Youll find him out on a job most nights, armed with his suppressed .22 rimfire rifle - the most popular kind of weapon among recreational shooters and small game hunters - which he carries around London in a nondescript brown tennis bag.He prepares for a shoot by asking his client to smear dog food (supposedly a fox favourite) in their garden at the same place and at the same time, every night for six nights.The prospect of a safe, easy and regular meal is enticing enough to trap any nearby foxes into a predictable routine, helping Tom outsmart his notoriously savvy prey.Then, on the seventh night, he will be waiting in the house, his rifle loaded with bullets which punch effortlessly through fur and bone.As the fox creeps into his line of fire, a muffled, barely audible shot from above will kill it.Its estimated that over 100 fox assassins operate in London alone, with many more in other cities throughout the UK.Bruce Lindsay Smith, 60, is one such marksman with over 40 years experience, and the owner of a pest control business which takes out over 1,500 foxes a year.His record is 33 kills in one night on a golf course, using the same lethal methods as Tom to deliver swift, silenced blows before the fox even knows what hit it.Speaking to The Sun, he said: There are more urban foxes around than I have ever known. People are struggling to cope — they are wrecking gardens, strewing rubbish everywhere and attacking pets.The kindest thing is to shoot them. They don’t know you are there, then are stone-dead.”Rough estimations place the UK fox population at around 450,000, with as many as 150,000 of these living in cities, sustained mostly by food waste from restaurants and takeaways.They make their dens in garden sheds or under decking, and are known for their nightmarish screeching noises - used to confirm their territory and communicate during mating season.And many urban foxes carry parasites like ringworm, fleas, ticks and roundworm, which can be passed on to people or, more likely, pets through their faeces.Its illegal to poison or relocate foxes, leaving Toms controlled, deadly approach as one of the few ways fox populations can be thinned out without breaking the law.He holds a licence for his gun, and always tips off police before a shoot, ensuring he wont end up in a sticky situation if a neighbour sees him brandishing a rifle in a suburban garden.Im not required by law to do that but I think its the right thing to do for safety - not least my own, he says. Walking around London with a rifle, I could be set upon by armed police, so it saves a lot of hassle and a lot of undue attention.Tom calls time on most shoots in the early hours of the morning.With permission, he then takes the bodies to a patch of Sussex farmland and burns them.But with thousands of foxes in every British city, theres no way to make a real dent in their numbers - and theres always the risk that slain foxes in your garden will just be replaced by more.We cant help foxes coming into peoples gardens - its always going to happen, pest controller and military veteran Steve Barron tells Sun Online.Culling foxes doesnt work. However, removing individual foxes that have got over-familiar and are causing issues does work.When a fox is over-familiar with a school, home or construction site, the only way to deal with it is to target the individual foxes that are causing an issue. Theres no physical threat from repellents so theyll just ignore it.Shooting is instantaneous with minimal stress, provided checks are carried out on a regular basis. Its safer and more humane.Its always done as a last resort when we cant stop them from coming in to gardens by addressing the waste management system or carrying out meshing improvements to physically keep them out.Steve has worked as a fox controller since 2002, and he says business has been steady the whole time.He reckons the best way to deal with a back-garden fox infestation is by cutting off their food supply - by keeping bins indoors - or by meshing up your garden so its impossible for a fox to enter.Foxes are extremely athletic, he says. They can easily scale a six-foot fence, and if its not going over it can go under.I help out at private households, commercial buildings, sports facilities and construction sites.Theres no set fee. Its not like going down to Tesco and buying a pint of milk. I have to treat each job on its merits.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term. That must not deter us.When the EU finally realises Brexit in full is inevitable maybe they will stop playing games and agree a deal.But if the Remain resistance succeeds in crippling Brexit, it will bring on chaos.Our current divisions will seem like happy hour. And it will be their fault.HEARTBREAKING, isn’t it, to see Argentina in disarray and the Germans wobbling at the World Cup? We’re just about managing to keep our chins up.Let’s hope Harry Kane and our boys can show them how it’s done tomorrow.Do us proud, lads!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in.

Definitely, a real connection.”Who, of course, apart from Adam, who was going to be trouble from the moment he introduced himself as: “Not the serious man you see on Instagram.”A personal trainer unencumbered then by the flab of self-doubt who’s got a hint of the Blutos about him and flags up the moments he’s about to be cocky by ­saying: “Not being cocky but . . .”You can’t argue with the female ­reaction, though. Kendall, Megan, Rosie and Zara have all fallen for the swaggering great berk and Adam’s dumped all but the last of them with a smirk of self-satisfaction.As a way of endearing yourself to the core audience, it’s not good. As reality TV baddies go, however, he’s gold.It was inevitable then, I suppose, the fun police would also start taking an interest in him.Sure enough, there they were above the caption “Is Adam’s behaviour unacceptable?” on Thursday’s This Morning, where Katie Ghose, from Women’s Aid — who you’d hope had better stuff to do — was claiming: “Adam’s behaviour is a form of emotional abuse.”It didn’t take a genius to make the obvious point here. It took Towie’s Lauren Goodger, who said: “It’s just a TV show” and Adam’s merely taken the ­multiple dating rules at face value.So, if you have a genuine moral objection, take it up with ITV rather than feeding their publicity machine.Personally, I don’t. I have, though, had a nagging sense something was missing from this year’s run and it wasn’t until last week I worked out what it was either. The opposition.Big Brother, which is normally, head-to-head with Love Island, has disappeared and, I can almost guarantee, none of you have noticed or regretted its absence either.So not only has Love Island been funny, entertaining, immune to political correctness and proved a point, it’s removed the pox of Big Brother in the process.And if that isn’t public service broadcasting of the highest order and worthy of a plug, I dunno what is, frankly.The BBC failing to put Mark Lawrenson out of his obvious misery. Gary Lineker using apparently random World Cup trivia to draw attention to his goal-scoring exploits.The main BBC News actually doorstepping Lord Sugar over one stupid bladdy Tweet.This Morning’s Russell Grant spraying his astrological BS all over Love Island with the claim: “Rosie gave way to Adam too quickly ’cos of Mars in Venus and Venus and Leo.”And host Phillip Schofield failing to deliver the very obvious response: “Your head in Uranus.” TIME was, BBC comedy would make fun of Rick from The Young Ones, and all his ridiculous right-on pretensions.These days he’s running the show, in the guise of a man called Shane Allen who, not withstanding a thousand layers of state bureaucracy, has the easiest mission statement in television – make the viewers laugh.Apparently not, though. According to Shane, running BBC comedy these days is about finding “the diversity story”.Which sounds a bit like awarding the World Cup trophy to Switzerland, on the grounds of the squad’s ethnic mix.Except he doesn’t really mean diversity. It’s just those groups the BBC likes that Shane wants to employ, having made it abundantly clear “Oxbridge white blokes”, who’ve punched well above their weight, historically, are no longer required.So, at a stroke, you deny yourself any chance of finding talents and shows as brilliant, era-defining and clever as Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G/Borat), Pete and Dud, Python, Fawlty Towers, Jimmy Carr, Fry \u0026amp Laurie, The Goodies and Not The Nine O’Clock News, while still very much lumbering us with the likes of Mel \u0026amp Sue, Famalam and Tittybangbang.For the privilege of institutionalising this failure and replacing an imagined prejudice with a very real one, I’ve also just learned we pay the BBC’s Head of Comedy £208,000 a year.Laugh?I didn’t.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “What South American country comes first alphabetically?”Mark: “Zimbabwe.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “Beginning with the letter J, what word means liquid extracted from fruit?”Carroll: “Glucose.”Andrew O’Keefe: “What sedimentary rock is an anagram of the word leash?”Karen: “Coal.”And Andrew O’Keefe: “Which wig-shaped New York building was ­constructed in 1902?”Hat: “Trump Tower.”No, but I like the way you’re thinking, Hat.NEXT up from BBC2’s department of really dumb ideas?You take two of the greatest and most original comic talents of the last 30 years, Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse.And send them bloody fishing.A combination which, in terms of things I don’t want to watch, is right up there with Vic Reeves \u0026amp Harry Enfield restoring vintage cars and Mel \u0026amp Sue attempting stand-up comedy.Mind you, the point of Gone Fishing also seemed lost on Bob Mortimer, as he trudged off to a Norfolk lake, angling for tench and asking his new mate: “What do we hope to achieve by the end of this, Paul?”Long pause.“A bit of inner peace?”What’s in it for the viewers became less and less clear as the silent pauses became longer.To the extent that, if you were lucky, Gone Fishing may just have been television to fall asleep to.If you weren’t, the last thing you may ever have heard was Bob asking: “Anything, Paul?”“No. Nothing.”On the plus side, though, corpses will have missed the moment where the BBC suddenly abandoned the fishing trip and, genuinely (I’m not making this bit up) sent Bob and Paul to a local micro-brewery.The resulting p***-up, you might not be wholly surprised to learn, wasn’t particularly well organised.Lee Dixon: “It’s a must-win game and Germany need at least a draw.”Phil Neville: “Mexico thoroughly deserve their 1-0 victory at half time.”Pablo Zabaleta: “At 3-1 down Tunisia need a goal to equalise the game.”Jason Mohammad: “One of the impressive things about Germany, the whole tournament, they were just so German-like.” Compiled by Graham Wray.THIS week’s winner is Sir Reg Holdsworth, in a wig, and Sir Reg Dwight (Elton), in a wig.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And things then got a bit out of hand and the surprises got more and more surprising.Brian built a stone folly to link the fernery to the oriental garden and we turned on old underground air raid shelter into a shell grotto, with the entrance hidden behind a gothic summerhouse.The sunny borders near the house are all colour themed and the paved terrace was reorganised with an open veranda, raised lion’s head fountain and lots of pots and hanging baskets.There was lots of trial and error, both in terms of design and planting, but we just learnt as we went along and changed the things that didn’t work.The couple have found a clever way to water the garden by installing large, hidden water tanks, which collect rain water off the roof and distribute it through leaky hoses snaking down the borders.But Anne admitted the garden still took hours of pruning and deadheading each day.She said: We are such plantaholics that the beds are stuffed with plants, so there is no room for weeds, but we have to do a lot of refereeing, to save the shyer plants from the bullies.Managing the trees, so they don’t overwhelm the garden, also requires constant vigilance, as does the ongoing battle with slugs and snails.One visitor said ours was a Tardis garden – bigger on the inside than the outside and another even claimed to be lost once.We wanted to create a garden that has something unexpected around each corner and we seemed to have done that."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416170161.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tributes showjumper unknown substance devon","story":"The young girl who died has been named locally as talented showjumper Hannah Bragg, 15, of Tavistock, Devon.A 14-year-old boy who was discovered with Hannah remains in a critical condition.On Monday, dozens of schoolchildren in uniform gathered for a vigil in the woods, just metres from when Hannah was taken ill.They sang songs and tearfully hugged each in front of a shrine of flowers that has been created for Hannah.There were also tributes and flowers left on the entrance to the coastal path.One note read: To the most beautiful angel in the sky, me and Harry are going to miss you so much.Harry will grow up knowing his auntie was a beautiful, kind hearted girl.

The headteacher of Tavistock College, where Hannah was a year ten pupil also paid tribute.In a letter to parents Sarah Jones said: It is with great sadness that I inform you of the death at the weekend of a well loved Year 10 student at the college. The young lady was a bright, caring and thoughtful girl, who was always seen with a smile on her face and had an eagerness for taking part in all aspects of school life.We are devastated at this loss and send sincere condolences to her family and close friends.Paying tribute to the teen, Julia Bassett of the East Cornwall Hunt Pony Club - of which Hannah was a member - said Hannahs mother Karen Bragg had requested people to share their memories of her daughter online.She said: I am sure by now that most of you will have heard about the tragic and incredibly sad news relating to Hannah Bragg.Hannah had been a member of ECHPC for a number of years and was always polite and kind and did well in representing the club in a number of disciplines, most recently by being in team at Lyneham house.She continued: Hannah was a regular attendee and supporter of rallies with her lovely pony Micky. Hannah was awarded the clubs most improved rider award in 2016 for all the hard work she put into producing her pony from the cheeky chap he was when they first joined to the fantastic all rounder he turned into, which was very well deserved.I am sure you will all join us in sending our condolences to Hannahs family at this heartbreaking time.The club will be sending some flowers, but we feel it appropriate to hold a collection and also to run a fundraiser so a donation can be made to the Cornwall air ambulance service, who attended to Hannah on that fateful day.Jo Goulden Jones said: I cant even begin to comprehend how cruel life can be. Lucie and I were both saddened and shocked last night. Such a beautiful life to tragically cut short.Penny Redwood-Smith added: Absolutely tragic news. Thinking of Karen \u0026amp family at this sad time. Hopefully in time they can draw some comfort from the wonderful memories we all have of their beautiful daughter.Chris Hale wrote: So, so sad, we still cant believe that Hannah has been taken from us all.

This includes ensuring that those that seek to target voters online are actually permitted by law to do so.If voluntary action by social media companies is insufficient, the UKs governments should consider direct regulation.The Commission also recommended new checks to ensure that foreign money is not being used to influence UK elections and referendums.A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: The Government is committed to increasing transparency in digital campaigning, in order to maintain a fair and proportionate democratic process, and we will be consulting on proposals for new imprint requirements on electronic campaigning in due course.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These are likely to go unfulfilled, because he flaunts them so crassly.Yet before acknowledging that the Armed Forces need more money, which they do, we should recognise how hard it is to configure Britain’s defence and security posture at a time when threats and the means to address them are changing at awesome speed.Countering terrorism in some ways represents the least ­difficult element, because it is the only peril the public really cares about.It is evident to all save ­disciples of Julian Assange that electronic surveillance through GCHQ, supported by the intelligence services, armed police and military special forces, deserves generous funding, which it nowadays receives.It is much more difficult to identify the appropriate tools with which to equip the Armed Forces to meet the strategic threats, of which Russia ­represents the most obvious.When President Putin favours hybrid warfare embracing covert special forces, fake news, cyber attacks and subversion, are tanks and infantry battalions the appropriate responses?When US backing for Nato is wavering and key nations such as Germany forswear a serious combat capability, alongside what allies can we hope to present a common front?These are big and hard ­questions.A couple of months ago at a round-table dinner, some of Britain’s top generals and ­strategic gurus held forth about the threats as they see them.Afterwards, the former Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who was among the guests, told me that he had been disappointed by the ­unoriginality of the ideas expressed.Here were the brightest and best in the war studies ­universe, he suggested, still thinking inside the parameters of the familiar, when much that is unfamiliar is evolving all around us.In planning for the future, Army commanders deserve sympathy, because they are compelled to observe ­constraints imposed by public sentimentality, to which ­ministers make obeisance.For instance, the chronically under-recruited Scottish regiments should be reduced, instead of having their ranks filled with Fijians (yes, really), but that is politically unthinkable.Nobody dares to axe a foot guards battalion, because the Guards Division remains a powerful trades union.The Gurkhas, whose infrastructure and dependants’ costs now make them uneconomic, cannot be touched because no minister will risk Joanna ­Lumley once more taking to the streets on their behalf. ­Politicians, in their own defence, are entitled to point out that the leaders of the Armed Forces are often poor judges of strategic planning.The admirals of two decades ago begged, fought and pleaded for the Navy’s two preposterous carriers, which I have compared to the Egyptian pyramids — huge consumers of resources for negligible practical utility.It was always obvious that the F-35 aircraft for which they were designed are properly unaffordable by modern Britain.Beyond being described by Americans as “the planes that ate the Pentagon” because of their fantastic cost, recent assessments show them ­performing poorly in the key ground attack role, as do the RAF’s Typhoons, conceived as high-altitude interceptors.Moreover, it was always plain that almost the entire Royal Navy’s residual strength will be required to escort the carriers on active service, while they are incapable of inshore operation.A strong government and Defence Secretary would mothball the behemoths in a display of courage such as was last shown by Denis Healey in 1968 when he decided to withdraw British forces from east of Suez.Forces need more of almost everythingThey would also scrap the Trident deterrent replacement, again a big willy gesture for a little willy nation, inappropriate to our diminished status in the world.I know almost no one whom I respect in the defence loop — military or civilian — who favours trying to sustain a nuclear capability on the ­Trident scale.More money must be found to recruit, train and exercise a credible Army.The only certainty about ­Britain’s defence needs is that more soldiers are wanted, to meet a range of future threats.Something much more serious than the fanatics of IS could well confront Britain in the coming decades.American military friends often remind me that Britain’s Armed Forces today command respect neither from friends nor foes.I remember General Sir Mike Jackson saying ­ruefully, as head of the Army 12 years ago: “Mass matters, and we don’t have it.”Our rulers may sometimes be forgiven for lying to us, but should never be forgiven for lying to themselves, as ­members of this Government do repeatedly.Bits of Britain’s Armed Forces are still superb, but it will not do for ministers merely to keep reciting the tired mantra about how terrific the SAS is.This is a niche force, no more capable of frightening Russia or China than the England cricket team.Gavin Williamson is dead right, that our Armed Forces need more of almost everything.Such a pity, then, that he himself has no more credibility at Westminster than an England cricket coach.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They didn\u0027t address the problems or find solutions.:: EU leaders hold \u0027frank and open\u0027 talks at emergency migration summitEurope\u0027s migration policy doesn\u0027t work - the asylum burden remains on frontier countries like Italy and Greece to take the strain. And the returns policy doesn\u0027t work - failed asylum seekers (economic migrants) are not being returned home - either because their home country won\u0027t take them or because the EU country they are in fails to deport them often it\u0027s both.So they are left to live in an unpleasant illegal limbo.I am in touch with a number of people who I met through the years as I\u0027ve reported on migration.They have repeatedly been rejected for asylum and yet they are still here, trying again. The \u0027populist\u0027 and anti-establishment governments who secured power because of the 2015 failures have now politicised the issue and are forcing fundamental change.The paradox being that while the optics are of boatloads still arriving, the figures show that arrivals are a fraction of the number they were.This has caused ructions all over the place: :: Germany:: The Italian \u0027populists\u0027France and Italy have been lobbing insults at each other over the migrant issue. It\u0027s extremely unusual for two such central players in the EU to be at loggerheads.It\u0027s a useful demonstration of how the Italian \u0027populists\u0027 roll and it\u0027s playbook-Trump stuff.The two men who call the shots in Rome - Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Miao, the figureheads of the two coalition parties and both now deputy prime ministers - used their vast social media presence to appeal to their support base by denouncing the what they termed the arrogance of the French president (who had dared to suggest that the migration crisis was largely a political row rather than an actual crisis).An aside: Emmanuel Macron cast himself as anti-establishment when he won the presidency just over a year ago (was it only a year ago!?). Now he feels firmly establishment and up against the real mavericks in Italy. :: The migrants on the MedAn ever-growing number of charity rescue ships are stacking up in the Mediterranean with hundreds of rescued migrants on board waiting for a country to accept them.Italy and Malta are essentially playing chicken with them: each country holding the line not accepting the boats until an imminent danger to life forces them to.It\u0027s tough, reckless, maybe even illegal but, frankly, it\u0027s been effective in forcing the issue onto the table at EU level.Italy has made it clear that it isn\u0027t willing to deal with this issue alone.This short film which we made 18 months ago is an attempt to explain what\u0027s happening on the Med - nothing\u0027s changed since we filmed it. Watch it below. The discussion at EU leader level seems to be going round in circles.

New figures today show \u0026pound347million of investment was earmarked for new models and facilities in the UK in the first half of this year. That was almost half the \u0026pound647million in the same period in 2017, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) warned. The SMMT\u0027s chief today hit out at slow Brexit talks and unrealistic hopes by the Tory government. And last night, a BMW executive declared the giant will have to close its Mini and Rolls-Royce plants in the UK if Brexit seriously disrupts its supply chain.  Customs manager Stephan Freismuth told the Financial Times: We always said we can do our best and prepare everything. But if at the end of the day the supply chain will have a stop at the border, then we cannot produce our products in the UK. Mr Freismuth said we don\u0027t want to give up our UK plants - which together employ around 8,000 people, including at the Mini plant in Oxford. But he warned the car industry uses a \u0027just-in-time\u0027 system where parts arrive at the production line just hours before they need to be used. Mr Freismuth\u0027s warning came hours before today\u0027s official figures by the SMMT. The trade association has joined firms demanding the government end uncertainty about the UK\u0027s trade with the EU post-Brexit.  Chief executive Mike Hawes said: There is growing frustration in global boardrooms at the slow pace of negotiations. The current position, with conflicting messages and red lines, goes directly against the interests of the UK automotive sector which has thrived on single market and customs union membership. There is no credible plan B for frictionless customs arrangements.  Nor is it realistic to expect that new trade deals can be agreed with the rest of the world that will replicate the immense value of trade with the EU. Theresa May is poised to hold a Cabinet \u0027away-day\u0027 next week at her country retreat Chequers to choose between two customs plans. Brexiteers have publicly rubbished one plan, a \u0027customs partnership\u0027, and want a more costly but less EU-aligned plan of \u0027maximum facilitation\u0027 (Max Fac). The EU has as a customs union. This means the 28 member states trade EU goods for free - and set an equal tariff on non-EU goods. For example, US car imports to the EU carry a 10% tariff. Being in the customs union benefits the UK, because the EU is our largest trading partner and it prevents lorry checks at the border. But Theresa May wants the UK to leave the customs union because otherwise, Britain will have to follow EU rules and cannot strike trade deals around the world. She is considering two options. Customs partnership: This would see Britain collect tariffs on all imports on behalf of the EU. If the UK tariff is lower than the EU one, then firms would be able to reclaim the difference. Maximum Facilitation - \u0027Max Fac\u0027: This would use high-tech tracking devices to monitor the flow of goods. Businesses would operate as “trusted traders” and would be able to pay any tariffs at regular intervals rather than every time they cross a border."},{"url":null,"title":"england fans who sing pro","story":"NewsEngland fans who sing pro-Brexit chants at World Cup could trigger fines and \u0027punishment\u0027The stark warning comes as thousands of fans are expected at the Three Lions\u0027 match this Thursday against Belgium - home to the headquarters of the EU\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter10:39, 26 JUN 2018Updated10:43, 26 JUN 2018News5,000 fans are expected at the Three Lions\u0027 final Group G match (Image: TASS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSinging pro-Brexit chants at the World Cup could trigger fines and punishment, England football fans have been warned. The stark warning comes as 5,000 fans are expected at the Three Lions\u0027 final Group G match this Thursday against Belgium - home to the headquarters of the EU. Spirits are likely to be high at the stadium in Kaliningrad, on the Baltic Sea, after England clocked a record by thrashing Panama 6-1 on Sunday.  But fans who want to sing about Brexit in Russia have been warned not to get too carried away.  FIFA rules already state players must not display political, religious or personal messages or slogans in any language or form. A spokesman said the FA could also be held liable for behaviour by fans.  A FIFA spokesman told The Times: There is a risk of some kind of punishment to the FA if their fans are found to have used insulting or political slogans, as there would be for any national association. Asked by the  what would happen if pro-Brexit chants were sung against Belgium, a spokesman said: Of course, there is a risk of some kind of punishment to the FA. Fines imposed on the FA would not be unprecedented. Barcelona were fined 150,000 Euros by UEFA in 2016 after fans waved the flag of Catalan separatists.  And England fans chanting Brexit slogans would not be unprecedented either. A group were filmed during the 2016 European championship saying F*** off Europe, we all voted out. Roughly 3,000 England supporters are expected to jet in on charter flight trips for the match in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea.

Chloe Ayling, 21, hit the headlines last year after the lurid conspiracy to sell her as a sex slave on the dark web was revealed to a sceptical British public. Chloe, from Coulsdon in south London, has revealed further shocking details about her ordeal - and claimed she was even willing to have sex with her tormentor to stay alive. In an interview with The Sun, she said: “I thought I might have to sleep with him to survive. “My only move to get out of there alive was to get him to like me.” Lukasz Herba, from Poland, was found guilty of abducting the glamour model in July of last year and was order to serve a 16 year jail sentence by an Italian court. During the trial it emerged that Herba had become obsessed with Chloe after he discovered her photographs on Facebook. Chloe has described her relief that Herba is now behind bars and says she is overjoyed that doubts about her story have now been dismissed.  She said: “It’s a huge relief because I feel like my life has been on hold. “It was six days of hell — and then I had to deal with all the disbelief once I got home. I feel happy now that everyone knows I was telling the truth.” Chloe’s five-day ordeal began after she was lured to a fake photoshoot in Milan which had been organised by Herba and his accomplice. Upon arrival, she says she was injected with ketamine by a masked man and was taken to a farmhouse near Turin after being stuffed inside a suitcase.  She said: “Suddenly this man has his hand on my mouth — covering my nose. “And then another man ran in front of me with a mask on. I saw he had a syringe. “When I woke up I was so drugged. Slowly as I regained \u0026shyconsciousness, I realised I was in the back of a car. “I had no idea why they were \u0026shytaking me. Everything went through my head — are they going to rape me? Are they going to kill me?” Herba, 30, claimed that Ayling had been part of the elaborate plot and had gone along with it to help boost her profile. CCTV footage of the pair holding hands while shopping for clothes cast further doubts about about her story.  Mother-of-one Chloe says she had was forced to go along with Herba’s demands out of fear that she would be killed and was freed after she convinced him to release her to the the UK consulate. “He told me we were going shoe shopping because I’d need shoes to walk to the consulate in Milan when he released me. “When he asked to kiss me I didn’t say no. I didn’t want to upset him. Instead I would say, ‘Maybe in the future.’ “He asked me to hold hands and I was hardly going to say no. He had so much power over me. “He was never violent but he would often show me his knife as a veiled threat. I knew not to mess with him. “I \u0026shydiscovered he had been trying to create ricin and cyanide at home before the kidnapping. “Imagine if I’d done something differently — it could have ended very badly.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gang women repeatedly stamp mans","story":"NewsGang of women repeatedly stamp on man\u0027s head in 2am brawl at Leicester Square underground stationThe 19-year-old man was taken to hospital and was left with a broken eye socket along with numerous cuts to his face\u0026nbspShareByElaine McCahill11:29, 26 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gang of women repeatedly stamped on a man\u0027s head in a furious 2am brawl at Leicester Square underground station.

Met Office issues Level 2 warning as sweltering heat could killTemperatures are soaring to almost 30C this week with wall-to-wall sunshine and very few clouds in sight\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMatthew Cooper07:29, 26 JUN 2018Updated08:57, 26 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritons are enjoying the first true heatwave of the year - but the sweltering summer conditions could prove deadly. The Met Office has issued a Level 2 warning as temperatures soar to almost 30C this week with wall-to-wall sunshine. It means people who go outdoors should take precautions to protect them from the sun, the Manchester Evening News reports. Here is everything you need to know about the warning, this week\u0027s heatwave and when it could end.  Why was a Level 2 heat warning issued? The alert and readiness warning is triggered as soon as there is a 80 per cent risk of \u0027threshold temperatures\u0027 being reached in one or more regions on at least two consecutive days and the intervening night. That means it must reach 30C on at least two consecutive days. Monday was the UK\u0027s hottest day of the year, with a top temperature of 29.4C in London. But it could be even hotter this week.  How is a heatwave defined? There is no official definition of a heatwave in the UK but generally it is a term employed when hot weather surpasses what is expected for a continuous period of time. This is different to the heat-health watch service, which is for health professionals and emergency planners, and has certain trigger thresholds depending on the region. It is the heat-health watch service warning that has been triggered on the Met Office website. The four levels are:  Level 1: This is the minimum alert and is in place every year from 1 June until 15 September, which is the period that heat-health alerts are likely to be issued. This minimum alert simply means that people should be aware of what to do if the alert level is raised. Level 2: Issued when there is a high chance that the threshold will be exceeded within the next few days Level 3: Issued when the thresholds have been exceeded Level 4: Issued when a prolonged hot spell becomes severe   What are the dangers? The rising temperatures have sparked a warning from Public Health England over very high UV levels. People should use sunscreen and limit their exposure to the sun to avoid burns. Children or pets left in hot cars are at significant risk of death or serious injury. People heading to the beach or enjoying the sun near bodies of water should heed water safety messages. Pollen levels are also very high, meaning it is a bad time for hay fever sufferers.  Dr Owen Landeg, of Public Health England, said: “For some people, such as older people, those with underlying health conditions and those with young children, the summer heat can bring real health risks. That’s why we’re urging everyone to keep an eye on those you know who may be at risk this summer. If you’re able, ask if your friends, family or neighbours need any support. And if you’re going outside for a prolonged period, remember UV is high at this time of year so think how the sun affects you and what you’d do to make sure you don’t get burned.  Are there Hot Weather Payments? People on certain benefits may get Cold Weather Payments if the conditions are particularly bad. You’ll get a payment if the average temperature in your area is recorded as, or forecast to be, zero degrees Celsius or below for seven consecutive days. You’ll get \u0026pound25 for each 7 day period of very cold weather between 1 November and 31 March. There is no Hot Weather Payment system in the UK, neither is there a minimum temperature for it being legally to hot to work.  Can I refuse to work in the heat? The law does say that if a significant number of employees are complaining about thermal discomfort then it\u0027s the employer\u0027s responsibility to carry out a risk assessment, and act on its results. The HSE says employers should base their assessment on the thermal comfort of workers - they say thermal comfort describes a person’s state of mind in terms of whether they feel too hot or too cold. It adds:  Environmental factors (such as humidity and sources of heat in the workplace) combine with personal factors (ie your clothing) and work-related factors (how physically demanding your work is) to influence your thermal comfort. Thermal comfort is very difficult to define as you need to take into account a range of environmental, work-related and personal factors when deciding what makes a comfortable workplace temperature. The best that you can realistically hope to achieve is a thermal environment that satisfies the majority of people in the workplace. Thermal comfort is not measured by room temperature, but by the number of employees complaining of thermal discomfort. To better understand why room temperature alone is not a valid indicator of thermal comfort.

The royals do have a habit over deliberating over these announcements and much like Zara\u0027s cousin, William, the couple appear to be in no rush to announce their daughter\u0027s name. Back in April, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge waited four days before letting the world know Prince Louis\u0027 name.

While not a princess, Zara is still a member of the Royal family .   Meaning she may very well have to follow the same protocol as her titled cousins and relatives.

The single engine plane was en route to a nearby airfield in Detroit, America, when it ploughed into trees and crashed near some homes. Moments before the crash, the pilot had reported issues with the landing gear and fuel supply, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Footage showed the small plane burst into flames with passengers Greg and Julie Boaz and Greg\u0027s 17-year-old son Peyton inside.

Kelli Sage, who specialises in foot fetishes, worried her career would be over and that clients wouldn\u0027t want someone with no nose after the attack. But the 29-year-old claims her injuries have had no adverse affect on business. With bills to pay and keen not to let down her clients, who make \u0027substantial\u0027 donations for each session, she has continued in her line of work. Kelli, who admits she has always been kinky, was left with blood streaming down her face after being mauled by a pit bull last year. She said: “At first, I thought, ‘You can’t be a fetish dominatrix with no nose.’  I panicked about how I was going to continue with the job I love after what happened. “But I had bills to pay, so there was no way I could stop working completely, and the interest did not dry up.” Kelli, who splits her time between Florida and New York, US, describes herself as a ‘hippy’ dominatrix as she is a vegan and does not wear the traditional leather bondage clothing. She began working in the fetish industry in 2009, wanting to make money and be open about her sexuality, and her sessions range from 30 minutes to 12 hours. Realising that she could earn enough from her \u0027talent\u0027 to live on and cover the cost of renting a three-bedroom home and a fetish studio - seeing clients at both - she soon became a dominatrix full-time. She says she is polyamorous - involved with more than one partner - although she is currently in a monogamous relationship with a man. And when she is not working, she is keen to help others.  But in September last year, as she distributed leftover bread from her sister\u0027s wedding to Manhattan\u0027s homeless, she left some beside a sleeping man for the next day\u0027s breakfast when his pit bull dog attacked her. She recalled: “It all happened so fast I can barely remember anything until I went to touch my nose and realised there was nothing there. “Blood was streaming down my face onto the floor and I started shouting for someone to call 911. “Even then, I didn’t blame the dog, he was protecting his space and I shouldn’t have moved into it like I did.”  Rushed to New York’s Bellevue Hospital, during the ambulance ride Kelli started panicking about the state of her face and the impact it could have on her job.  “I worried that my career would be over,” said Kelli. How could I be dominatrix with no nose? Would people want to come to me still?” When Kelli, who had her wound cleaned and was given antibiotics, saw the extent of her injuries in the mirror of the hospital toilet, she was horrified. “I could see almost everything inside my face. I was terrified, she said.  She was offered a choice between having a skin graft from her legs or bottom to help repair her nose, or flap surgery - where the skin would be used from her forehead to cover it while remaining attached. Speaking about how she opted for the flap, she explained: “I was told a skin flap has a lower risk of the repair failing compared with a skin graft. Also, I really didn’t want my butt or legs to be damaged with the skin being taken from there, as well as my face. Four days after the attack, following the first of four operations, Kelli was discharged and wasted no time in getting back to work. “I had bills to pay,” she said. “It wasn’t an option for me to just stay at home. The insurance covered most of my surgeries, but I had my rent to pay, bills and needed food to eat.” Rather than giving her usual thrice nightly sessions however, Kelli did some of her work using video chat.

While the classic option is still understandably a favourite, the fast-food giant now also serves up a huge variety of other fried-chicken goodness. And now bosses have decided to bring back one of the favourites burgers after a hugely successful limited edition run last year. It has sold out in every country it has every been released in - and it\u0027s easy to see why.  That\u0027s right, the Double Down burger will be back on the KFC menu soon - and fans are going to go wild for it. It was first sold in the UK back in October as a limited-edition treat, but it seems bosses have now decided to bring it back. The unusual burger doesn\u0027t have a bun (who needs those naughty carbs anyway?) and uses two pieces of fried chicken instead, with bacon, cheese and barbecue sauce making up the filling.  The company teased the re-release of the burger in a bizarre Twitter exchange with the digital editor of Birmingham Live news website.       Back in October, when the burger was first released Jack Hinchliffe, director of KFC UK \u0026amp Ireland, said the burger has sold out in every country it has ever been released in. He said: There\u0027s been so much excitement for the Double Down since it first launched to the US in 2010. It\u0027s sold out in every country that it\u0027s been released in. Fandom has gone wild over the past few years on social media, and we\u0027ve even had reports of our customers taking things into their own hands by hacking the menu to create the sandwich.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b715bb7ee0-788x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc the big days in dark blues history books","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAs is the case with most provincial clubs, for Dundee, trophies are a welcome bonus, not a given.In their 125-year history, the Dark Blues have lifted major domestic silverware on five occasions, though not since their League Cup win of 1973.Their first success came 17 years after the club was formed, in the shape of the 1910 Scottish Cup – the only time they’ve lifted the country’s most prestigious knockout trophy.In typical fashion, the one time Dundee did win it, it was the hard way.The first round saw them held by Beith, technically away from home but actually at Dens Park after the opposition surrendered home advantage, before winning the replay 1-0.A crowd of 20,000 then saw them take care of Falkirk at the first time of asking and it was the same with Motherwell in the third round.In the semi-finals they needed three games before beating Hibs by the only goal of the entire tie at Parkhead.That set up what was to be an epic final against Clyde, the side who would finish just above them in the First Division that season.Game one of an Ibrox triple header ended in a 2-2 draw on April 9 and, when the teams met again seven days later, there was no scoring.Dundee were finally able to kiss silver for the first time on April 20, 1910, when goals from Jimmy Bellamy and John ‘Sailor’ Hunter saw them edge out the Bully Wee by 2-1.That sparked off wild celebrations and although that second replay was a midweek game, the team were mobbed when they arrived back home by train late in the evening.Despite a few near things, it was to be 41 years before the fans were able to welcome another trophy to the city.That was when the side put together by director/manager George Anderson, and that was inspired by Scotland inside- forward Billy Steel, went all the way in the League Cup.Having edged out Hearts in the group stage, they beat Falkirk 2-1 over the two legs of the quarter-finals. A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Dighty-Burn-stock-image-1.jpg ","title":"148k funding to open up the dighty burn","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAlmost £150,000 of funding has been granted to transform the area around the Dighty Burn.East Dundee Environment Network (Eden) will use the funding to open up pathways, enabling more people to take advantage of the green space.A programme of arts, outdoor learning and conservation activities will also be introduced.The £148,000 funding comes as part of £1.2 million of grants awarded by the National Lottery.Eden project co-ordinator Ann Lolley said: “We are pleased to have been awarded this funding.“It will allow us to work alongside local people to improve the run-down entrances to the Dighty Burn from the community of Douglas so that more people can enjoy the wildlife, water, green spaces and footpaths along the burn.”Big Lottery Fund Scotland chairwoman Maureen McGinn said: “We are awarding funding to 12 diverse community projects.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0ee006656-836x564.jpg ","title":"bowmans new dundee united role is vital says boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManager Csaba Laszlo is delighted Dundee United legend Dave Bowman has agreed to take on the new role of the club’s Scottish scout.It will see ‘Bow’ take on responsibility of identifying players already operating north of the border who could become signing targets for the Tangerines.And during the season he will be the man who makes sure Csaba knows exactly what to expect from future opposition.“I am very happy about Bow’s decision to be our scout. He will look for new players for us and he has experience in this direction, so I know he will recommend the right people,” said Csaba.“He will also look at opposition and this is vital for us. He is very close to the first team and it is an important position.“Paul Sturrock is doing a lot of work, but he will more or less be down in England and Bow will be here as our man on the ground.”Meanwhile, having signed nine players already this summer, the pace of the rebuilding is set to slow, though there will be more new arrivals in the coming weeks.For Csaba it is important that most of the players he wanted were secured in time for pre-season training getting under way on Thursday.“For the pre-season, more or less 90% of the team must be ready,” added Csaba.“You have to prepare the team, so it was important we had made these signings.“The majority of players we wished for and who we talked to are here.”United are still in the market for another central defender, while one more striker could be added to the squad in the coming weeks.That could see a number of trialists joining up for training and possibly even games, though Csaba has decided against arranging a closed-door game in which an entire line-up of players looking to earn a contract would be used.“Maybe there are one or two possibilities for that (trialists), but if you have to go on trial, for me, there is something wrong.“I am not against loan players but they must be one who can help the team and they have to have ambition.”Fans will get their first look at the new signings in a friendly at Brechin on Tuesday week.So far that’s the only pre-season game fixed up, but at least one more is likely to be confirmed soon.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/06/Gjen_Kingsway_Traffic3.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"busy stretch of dundees kingsway to close as pedestrian crossings installed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of the busiest stretches of road in Dundee is set to close twice in the next two weeks so new pedestrian crossings can be installed.The A90 Kingsway will close eastbound between the Old Glamis Road roundabout and the Forfar Road junction from 7.30pm on Friday until 6.30am next Monday.The dual carriageway will then close in the opposite direction, westbound from Forfar Road to Old Glamis Road, from 7.30pm on Friday July 6 until 6.30am on Monday July 9.During each closure, vehicles will likely be diverted via either Claverhouse Road or Clepington Road.The closures are being instigated by Dundee City Council in order to install new sets of pedestrian crossings that will make getting to and from Caird Park safer for walkers and cyclists.Workers will install Toucan-style crossings, which have wider crossing paths than Pelican or Puffin crossings, along the Kingsway.Council chiefs do not expect the crossings to cause traffic build-ups, as they will only activate when required by crossing pedestrians or cyclists.As revealed by the Tele last year, the council drew up plans to install the crossings at the Kingsway’s junctions with Graham Street and Mains Loan.The plans were made possible by a Scottish Government grant to encourage people to walk and cycle.Severe disruption is expected as a result of each closure, as the road is the main link between the central belt and Aberdeenshire.Analysis from traffic counters operated by the Department for Transport shows that, on average, more than 38,000 vehicles travel eastbound on the road every day.These include more than 28,000 cars, 135 buses, 6,900 light goods vehicles and 2,800 heavy goods vehicles such as articulated lorries.A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “These closures are to facilitate the installation of new dual Toucan crossings linked to Caird Park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b30b38a540e6-e1529933778347.jpg ","title":"dalmation ludo jets out of dundee by plane after family

arrived in Dundee a fortnight ago to be adopted by a local family.But his stay was short-lived, after it emerged a young family member was allergic to dogs.Ludo had been placed with the family by the Dalmatian Adoption Society, based in Gloucester.Sue Bell, of the society, said Ludo arrived in Dundee via a series of car journeys driven by volunteers.But he left in style – after an amateur pilot offered to fly him back to England.Sue said: “Very sadly after Ludo went to live with his new family in Dundee they discovered their little boy was allergic to him and ended up having to use an inhaler.“The family were heartbroken but had no choice other than to put Ludo back up for adoption.“We were delighted when a family in South Wales agreed to adopt Ludo and we again put out an appeal for volunteers to transport Ludo back down south.“That is when our airborne knights in shining armour came to our rescue.”Nick Baker and William Simmonds contacted Sue to offer to fly Ludo back to Gloucester for onward movement to his new home.Amateur pilot and plane owner William said: “I happened to see an old friend, Nick Baker, had posted on the Dalmatian Adoption Society’s Facebook page, in response to an appeal for help.“I had recently seen a post from another pilot who had flown a puppy for re-homing – which triggered the idea that perhaps I could do a similar thing.“After looking into the routes and journey times, I got in touch with Nick and suggested I might be able to do the flying were he to sit in the back and look after Ludo.“He got in touch with Sue and the rest is history.“I am looking to increase my flying experience and intend to complete my commercial pilot licence. These are hours I’d have to fly anyway, so having the ability to help such a worthy cause as part of my hour building is extremely gratifying.”Nick said: “I have a love for dalmatians and DAS do a great job saving dogs and managing to get them re-homed.“I always do my best to help out in any way I can. When I saw a dog needed transport from Scotland to South Wales I offered my help.“Will messaged me regarding the option of flying to reduce the travel time for Ludo.“He has a share in a plane and a love of flying so was willing to do the journey for free.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee kid henvey signs new dark blues deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee kid Matty Henvey has signed a new one-year contract.The 18-year-old striker broke into the first team near in late December and went on to make four appearances.He was side-lined by an injury suffered as he scored a dramatic late goal in the win at Hamilton Accies at the end of January and missed most of the rest of the season.Matty\u0026#8217s goals in the first part of the season were key to Dundee\u0026#8217s runners-up position in the development league.He joined the rest of the first team squad last week for pre-season training.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/B88-1971-08-00-Children-at-Broughty-Ferry-Beach-CDCT.jpg ","title":"dundee people from the 1920s to now hot summer days in the ferry","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFamilies enjoying a day out on the beach, kids having a splash about in the water, fishing off the harbour\u0026#8230 while somethings have undoubtedly changed over the years, it’s clear many things have remained exactly the same in Broughty Ferry.The suburb has long had a host of attractions and activities for residents and visitors alike.We dive into our archives once more to see what summer days were like in the Ferry.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2780eda4be9.jpg ","title":"dundee people karen helps to heal and comfort others","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“My job allows me to help heal and comfort others who are going through grief.”Karen Docherty, 42, has arguably one of the most unusual jobs that we have featured in this column. She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people pictures thousands gather at park for dundees race for life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of fundraisers turned up at Camperdown Country Park for a very worthy cause.Race for Life saw women and men of all ages, mostly decked out in pink, as they took part in a 10k run to raise cash for Cancer Research.Running, walking, jogging and even sprinting, more than 2,000 participants took part in the race around the city’s largest public park.There was also a 5k option, with some participants completing the event while twirling 4lb hula hoops – also known as powerhoops – round their waists."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff717cc5.jpg ","title":"dundee people residents celebrate after saving post office from closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHilltown residents were rejoicing after the community saved the local post office from closure.Following the retirement of the sub-postmistress in 1991, the Post Office announced the branch would be closed.The plans caused an uproar, with residents and councillors all pulling together to oppose the plan, which was finally shelved.Betty Hand, of the Ladywell off-licence, who was a customer of the branch, supplied bottles of bubbly for the celebratory party.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people rubbish effort a good example","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPupils  Barnhill Primary School in Dundee have taken part in a litter pick.Fifteen youngsters took part and collected rubbish from their school grounds and the surrounding area.Councillor Craig Duncan, who also joined in, said the pupils were enthusiastic and that three bags of rubbish – including plastic bottles, crisp packets, sweet wrappers and broken plant pots – were collected.Mr Duncan said: “The kids were cheerful and are all up for doing another one.

line to receive six figures from Celtic when Armstrong completes an expected £6 million switch to English Premier League outfit Southampton this week.It’s because of a sell-on clause from the deal when the Scottish international left Tannadice for Parkhead back at the end of January 2015.Once the £1m plus the Hoops paid for him then is deducted, the cash heading to Tannadice is likely to be between £400,000 and half a million.While that will be more than welcome as United prepare for another money-losing season in the Championship, with the player’s likely move to England coming out of the blue, it is not something they budgeted for.That means the further signings being planned will not be hit by the fact Celtic do not have to pay up straight away and, if they choose, could stagger the payments over two or three years.What the money could become is a nice extra for manager Csaba Laszlo if he makes moves in the transfer market during the January window.Right now he is looking to put the finishing touches to rebuilding a squad that’s already seen eight new first-team players fixed up.He remains in the market for another striker and a central defender, in particular.Potential target Callum Morris completed a moved to second-tier rivals Ross County at the weekend – along with former Tannadice team-mate Keith Watson.Morris was still on a list of possible signings but after securing stopper Frederic Frans earlier this month, a footballing defender is being sought.Former striker David Goodwillie could complete a move from Clyde to Premiership new boys Livingston this week

week current Tangerines boss Csaba Laszlo had stated that was the case and although he did not name McKinnon, he did mention the period during which his predecessor was in charge at the club.McKinnon, now in charge at United’s Championship rivals Morton, has responded by issuing a statement.“In light of reports in the press this week regarding the signing of players at Dundee United during my period as manager, I feel I have no option other than to clarify the following point,” it read.“I deal in facts only and the fact is that in my time as manager every single player signed was put through a medical by the medical staff at Dundee United.“I am disappointed that I have had to make this statement because although things did not work out the way I would have wished, I left the club on good terms.“I have moved on and my focus is on an exciting new challenge at Morton.”He would make no further comment and it’s understood he now considers the matter closed.United, meanwhile, were back at work on Thursday as pre-season training kicked off.Almost a full squad was on duty, with only goalie Deniz Mehmet unable to do any work following surgery.Midfielder Fraser Fyvie didn’t do any

I said ‘if you can do it, sign’.“It’s a really good club – even if it’s the rival of my team! I’d prefer if he signed for Dundee but it’s still a good club.“United have got a good goalkeeper in him. He’s massive, really tall and his English is perfect so that won’t be a problem.“He’s good on the ball and can pass well. Even under pressure you can pass him the ball and he can deal with it, he’s calm and experienced. He’s dominant in the box, too, and comes for crosses.“At Vaduz there were two goalkeepers and they switched all the time but I really enjoyed playing when Benjamin was in goal.”Konrad is considering offers from Holland and Germany but says he’d be happy to return to Scotland.“I would go back to Scotland, I really enjoyed my two years there, though I’ve not had any options there. If there was a good offer I would go back.“A year ago at Vaduz we were relegated and weren’t able to go back up last campaign.“We had a poor start to the season with basically a new team. You could compare it to Dundee United’s season in the Championship. There was one team that had a good start and just kept winning.“It was nice in Vaduz, a good place to play. I can’t compare it to Scotland, though.“The fans in Dundee were mad for football and the stadiums were great. I don’t know if the fans in Vaduz and Switzerland don’t like football much but it isn’t the No 1 sport and it was really calm in the stadiums.”That’s something he couldn’t say about derby days in Dundee – some of his best memories of his time at Dens Park.“I had the two best years of my career at Dundee.“The derby win after 10 or 11 years and beating them at home was great.“The first game at Celtic Park was also a good memory. It is a really famous stadium, even in Germany.“All the derby wins were really good experiences and I feel really proud to have been a part of those games.“I like the rivalry in Dundee. It’s not a nasty rivalry compared with some places in Germany, there’s no fighting, but a lot of banter and people have a bit of a laugh about it.“I still keep an eye on Dundee. Unfortunately there are not many players left from when I was there.“Maybe Gowser, Cammy and Craig Wighton. I still speak to Scott Bain and Nick Ross, too.”It was a mixed experience for Konrad working under manager Paul Hartley at Dens Park, however.“Paul Hartley was hard but fair, I would say.“He had his players, his top players who he would speak to all the time.“He wasn’t always easy, sometimes he would shout at me and Luka Tankulic for no reason but it was football, you live with that.\u0026#8220He played me 69 times in two years so I can’t complain.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cheeky-punter-caught-trying-to-get-served-at-beer-festival-using-little-britain-driving-licence","story":"                          A CHEEKY punter was caught trying to use this fake driving licence featuring the face of Little Britain\u0027s Andy Pipkin to get served booze at a beer festival."},{"url":null,"title":"astonishing-moment-six-year-old-produces-inch-perfect-strike-in-top-bin","story":"                          THIS is the astonishing moment a six-year-old produces an inch-perfect wonder strike while brushing up on her shooting skills in her back garden at home."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7883429.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"adorable-moment-young-boy-realises-animals-go-into-meat-and-turns-vegetarian","story":"                          THIS adorable video shows the moment a five-year-old boy realises that animals are turned into meat -

well as parents just trying to get about with prams claim they are struggling in the face of vehicles parked on pavements and over drop kerbs across Inverness.MSP for Inverness and Nairn, Fergus Ewing, has now spoken out in support of the Transport (Scotland) Bill which is currently making its way through Holyrood, saying it promises \"radical measures\" to improve accessibility and prohibit obstructive parking.\"Inconsistent and obstructive parking is a nuisance in our communities and greatly impacts on our ability to easily get around by foot, and so it is critical we empower local authorities to tackle this important issue,\" he said.Today a coalition of disability and mobility organisations called on Highland Council to develop an Inverness Street Charter, setting out measures to improve accessibility.Produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in liaison with Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and Highland Cycle Campaign among others their \"manifesto\" \u0026ndash Putting Inverness Streets Ahead \u0026ndash identifies pavement parking along with other issues such as street clutter and shared spaces for vehicles and pedestrians as restricting safe access.RNIB campaigns manager Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality of life for residents and, vitally, boost the reputation of Inverness as an open and welcoming tourist destination.\"Elsewhere, after wheelchair user David Sansum, from Kinmylies, branded the parking situation in Inverness \"a nightmare\" in last week\u0027 HN others have taken to social media to share their own frustrations.On Facebook Paul Tuthill said: \"As a powerchair user I find this

claimed that in some instances, drivers were forced to park on pavements by the lack of any alternative.He said that it is often impossible to find a space and blamed Highland Council for not providing parking as part of new residential developments.Speaking about the situation in his own street he said: \"I may also add everyone parks on one side of the pavement, leaving the other side clear at all times.\"A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Regardless of whether parking provision is made for any property development this does not give motorists the right to park on pavements which, if causing an obstruction, is a reportable offence enforceable by Police Scotland.\"If waiting or loading restrictions are present these also cover the footpaths and are enforceable by the

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on narrow pavements forcing pedestrians onto the road.The coalition want the council to adopt a Street Charter which would dictate conditions to be applied to any future planning or licensing applications.RNIB Scotland campaigns manager Dr Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality

welcoming to everyone \u0026ndash and the key to inclusivity is physical accessibility.\"She added: \"A Street Charter would help to avoid entrenching flawed designs that could blemish Inverness for a generation or more.\"Brian MacKenzie of the Highland Cycle Campaign said\u0026nbsp the drive to get things right first time made good financial sense for cash-strapped local authorities.\"For example, a 2015 House of Lords report on \u0026lsquoshared spaces\u0026rsquo (where roads and pavements are levelled allowing vehicles and pedestrians to use the same area) warns that \u0026lsquocouncils are risking public safety with fashionable simplified street design\u0026rsquo and notes that \u0026lsquomore and more local authorities are forced into expensive remedial work, often restoring crossings they have themselves removed\u0026rsquo,\" he said.The manifesto states: \"A Street Charter would offer planners and consultants a template for inclusive design, potentially saving the council money by cutting down on objections to plans or completed developments.\"And it adds: \"A Street Charter would also make for a more pleasant environment for people who don\u0026rsquot have disabilities as clutter-free streets and logical street layouts would make getting around easier and more appealing.\"Highland Council introduced a new policy in April, requiring trade waste bins to be kept off city

buildings","story":"\u0026nbspURGENT action is needed to prevent people from being injured or killed by debris falling from crumbling Inverness buildings, according to a former city provost.Councillor Jimmy Gray spoke out in support of Labour colleague and MSP David Stewart who is pressing for a new law compelling property owners to safely maintain their properties.Mr Stewart is contacting Highland Council chiefs to discuss his idea of regular surveys to gauge wear and tear, and to make owners carry out essential repairs.His proposal comes just a week after two people narrowly avoided being struck by falling debris in the city centre as Storm Hector hit.Earlier this year an apprentice stonemason also prevented another potential disaster when he spotted a masonry block hanging loose over Academy Street, apparently pulled loose by a banner attached to it.This week the Inverness Townscape Heritage project launched a new maintenance guide for owners of traditional properties, setting out key areas for them to consider, including the benefits of regular inspections.However Cllr Gray suggested a far tougher approach may be necessary.\"We cannot wait until there are serious injuries or deaths before stronger action is taken,\" he said.\"I\u0026rsquove been concerned for some time about the condition of buildings not only in Inverness but across Highland.\"We\u0026rsquove spent years trying to persuade owners of buildings to act responsibly. It hasn\u0026rsquot worked. We need to bring about a cultural change whereby owners take greater care and pride in their properties.\"I believe this will need to be supported by legislation which makes it compulsory for buildings to be checked regularly.\"He suggested surveys every three years, adding: \"We\u0026rsquove spent years in and around Inverness trying to persuade the owners of buildings to act responsibly and it hasn\u0026rsquot worked.\"\u0026nbspHighlands and Islands MSP Mr Stewart was successful in having legislation revised four years ago to allow local authorities to recoup money they spend on serving notices or for work carried out if a building is deemed dangerous.In January, kiltmakers Duncan Chisholm and Sons in Castle Street was served with a dangerous buildings notice by Highland Council and the local authority appointed contractors to make the building safe. It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs. But a crisis incident could not only injure people but affect their insurance and their reputation.\"A council spokeswoman said: \"We regularly remind building owners that the responsibility for ensuring the safety of members of the public in and around their buildings lies with them \u0026ndash whether commercial, retail, business, public or privately owned.\"The new maintenance guide can be downloaded at https://academystreet.org/Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 1:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"042ex2606eea_story__9","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew signing Chris Forrester was today challenged to rediscover the form that made him the hottest prospect in the League of Ireland.Such was Forrester’s potential Dons boss Derek McInnes attempted to sign him more than four years ago.Ultimately Aberdeen lost out on the playmaking midfielder because they could not afford the transfer fee wanted by St Patrick’s Athletic.Forrester helped St Pat’s win the top-flight title before transferring to Peterborough United in League One for an undisclosed fee in 2015.Following Peterborough’s decision to transfer list Forrester this season, McInnes moved to finally secure his man for £200,000 in a deal until summer 2021.Forrester is back in his home country Republic of Ireland with the Dons at a pre-season training camp in Cork.He is set to make his debut in a friendly against Cobh Ramblers on Saturday.It is a long-awaited appearance in a Dons shirt McInnes hoped would materialise back in 2014.Forrester underlined his potential by scoring for St Pat’s in a 2-2 friendly draw with Aberdeen in Dublin in July 2014. But McInnes had made a move before then. He said: “I knew about Chris back then (July 2014) because I had been speaking to his agent.“We were well aware that Chris was making headlines in the League of Ireland and was having that exposure. He was seen as the next one that was going to come across the water and get a transfer.“We looked at Chris then and liked him but couldn’t afford the transfer fee that eventually took him away.“We had been well aware of Chris before we played St Pat’s in that friendly.”In his first season in England the 25-year-old midfielder was a stand-out for Peterborough and forced his way into the Republic of Ireland squad.He received a first international call-up in March 2016 for friendlies against Switzerland and Slovakia as part of the Euro 2016 build-up.Forrester has yet to be capped. But his form saw him appointed Peterborough captain.Following Forrester’s impressive performance in a 4-1 FA Cup defeat to Premier League Chelsea in January 2017, Posh owner Darragh MacAnthony insisted the midfielder “would go on to be sold for millions and millions”.Less than 18 months later McInnes swooped to secure him for £200,000.Now the Reds boss has urged Forrester to not only recreate that form that saw Peterborough rate him at around £4m. He also wants the Dubliner to produce the strongest season of his career to date, starting with the Europa League second qualifying round clash against Premier League Burnley next month.On the multi-million price tag of 2017, McInnes said: “He has found himself in a place where he is not that at the minute.“Chris had been playing a different type of role and had found himself a wee bit out of favour there (at Peterborough).“That can happen sometimes with a player.“I am hoping Chris sees this season as going to be the best of his career so far.“If he can get to what we think he is capable of then we have a very good player in the squad.“One who is capable of helping us.”Forrester is one of three midfielders signed by McInnes in what will be a busy summer transfer window. Another Dubliner, Stephen Gleeson, penned a two-year deal.Republic of Ireland international Gleeson, 29, was a free agent having left Ipswich at the end of last season. Also secured was 18-year-old Lewis Ferguson from Hamilton.The Scots clubs have failed to agree a training compensation package for Hamilton and it is set to go to a tribunal to decide the fee.McInnes and Aberdeen are confident they have done their due diligence and the tribunal will reach a fee closer to their valuation than Accies.The Dons initially offered in excess of £100,000 with Hamilton understood to be seeking around £900,000.All three new signings are with the Dons at their training camp at Fota Island Resort in Cork.McInnes said: “Midfield was an area of the team that needed addressed. We have brought in three players at different stages of their careers.“However, they have all came in with the same intention of progressing their own careers and helping us at the same time.“They all have their own qualities to show and I am sure they will do that in an Aberdeen shirt.”McInnes aims to secure further signings before facing Burnley in Europe.He aims to sign another defender, ideally a full-back.Despite already signing three midfielders McInnes remained keen on securing Hibs’ Dylan McGeouch.The Reds had offered the Scotland international the chance to become the club’s top earner should he opt to move to Pittodrie. However, they look set to lose out in the race for McGeouch, whose Easter Road contract expires at the end of the month. The 25-year-old has held talks with Sunderland.Rangers, Fulham and Blackburn are also interested in the midfielder.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen ice rink to close for repairs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA popular ice rink is to close for a month while repair work is carried out.Sport Aberdeen announced the Linx Ice Arena will be shut for four weeks starting next month in order to fix a “long-standing” issue at the rink.The £27,000 work is on the refrigation plant that keeps the temperature low to freeze the ice.Work will begin on July 23, with Sport Aberdeen expected to reopen the venue on August 20.The arena is home to three ice hockey clubs and has youngsters taking part in figure skating and synchronised skating.The home games of the Aberdeen Lynx Ice Hockey Club are also played at the venue.The club usually gets its season under way at the beginning of September.Director of operations and asset development Keith Gerrard said: “Sport Aberdeen can confirm investment in essential maintenance at the Linx Ice Arena affecting the refrigeration plant.“Work is being done to repair an essential part of the refrig-eration plant which ensures that the brine contained within under-ground pipes can be kept at a constantly low temperature to freeze the ice.

communities by elders, and trained in practical, religious and spiritual practices for between three and six months in a process called Mukanda.Sisters Diana and Antoinette Powell-Cotton, from Kent, made a two-year trip to Angola and Namibia, recovering 3,000 pieces, 130 of which were donated to the university.After more than 70 years in storage, the suit and a number of other artefacts will now be on display as part of an exhibition on growing up around the world.Rachel Rydquist, a museum studies student at the university, said: “By the time the sisters came back, it was the middle of the Second World War, and they were drafted in to be nurses in London.“So there’s a bit of a lack of information about it, because they were tied up with the war.“I don’t believe that it’s been put on display.“There’s so much stuff in the university collection, and it might just not have been a fit for any of the exhibits that were being done.”She added: “It’s also really difficult to put something out when there’s not a lot of information on it.”Rachel had taken the lead on researching the suit before it was put on display in the exhibition.The new project, which opened earlier this month in the King’s Museum, is to commemorate the Scottish Government’s Year of Young People.The exhibit, called Growing up: Different Journeys, is split into four sections – rites of passage, which the net suit is a part of, education, disruption and stories.According to Rachel, the exhibit aims to explore not only how different cultures experience growing up, but also the universal nature of becoming an adult.She said: “We thought it would be fitting in the Year of Young People, and to have artefacts that show the process across the world.”The exhibit will be open in the King’s Museum until November 30.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/rabbitnew-857x564.jpg ","title":"north east mechanic finds live rabbit under bonnet while carrying out

found the rabbit, who they have called Derek, tucked away behind the bodywork of a Vauxhall Corsa.Now the mechanic tasked with looking after the intrepid furry friend has appealed to the public to find Derek’s owner.Dave Gordon, 27, said: “It’s not uncommon to find animals stuck in cars, but usually it’s because they’ve met a grisly end.”Dave, who has been a mechanic for 10 years, said: “I’ve seen plenty of rabbits and birds stuck in cars, but never a live one.“Nobody in the garage has ever seen anything like it.”It was only when Dave and the other mechanics were preparing to work on the car that the big-eared stowaway was discovered.Dave said: “The car was brought in for its MOT and I pulled it up on to the ramp.“I started to check it over when I spotted a white shape tucked away behind the radiator grill and licence plate.“At first I thought the owner had hit a rabbit.“I got my torch out and noticed it was still breathing, so I took the front bumper apart to get it out.”Derek is now settling into his new surroundings, but where he came from remains a mystery.Dave doesn’t even know if the bunny is a pampered pet or a wild animal. He said: “He seems okay.He must have just climbed in because it’s cosy.

Made up of five people, including the driver, they worked in pairs and took turns to load large wheelie bins with sands.The bins were pushed 50 metres to a waiting truck, which was used to empty it, before the bins were taken back to the starting line in a series of timed heats.As well as the entry fee going to Alzheimer Scotland, members also set up a fundraising page – with £1,480 already raised.Money will be split between Inverurie food bank, CLAN, Willows Animal Sanctuary, Doddie Weir Foundation and Friends of the Special Nursery.There will be a further event on June 29 at Inverurie Golf Club to boost the cash already gathered.As well as supporting the north-east, the team said they were proud to represent all waste sector workers across Scotland.Team member Gemma Rosie, who came up with the idea to take part, said: “Everybody who has supported Scaffies on Tour to date cannot be thanked enough for all their support. The team had a whale of a time at the event, and have certainly made their mark on the event.“Organisers, exhibitors, other team members and the public – they all helped make our jaunt south all the more worthwhile and the team have certainly made a lot of new contacts, and friends who want to keep in touch.”The refuse collectors have also decided they will return next year to take part again, after this year’s competition was described as an “awesome experience”.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riley im trying to get back fit and playing again so i can repay peterhead for giving me another contract","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNicky Riley says his cruciate ligament injury has made him appreciate the simple things in life.It’s eight weeks since the Peterhead midfielder had surgery on his ruptured anterior cruciate ligament.Riley’s rehab has started, but currently he is restricted to light exercises and using an exercise bike.After 12 weeks Riley hopes he will be able to step up his rehab as he embarks on the long recovery process.The 32-year-old sustained the injury on January 30 in a match against Berwick Rangers at Shielfield Park.After having his operation at the end of April, Riley has been largely housebound and said that has made him appreciate things away from football like being able to walk and drive.He said: “I was on crutches for a while and I’m still walking with a slight limp just now, so I’m just trying to get back to walking normally.“There are things like walking that you take for granted but I’ve been walking with a limp.“It’s difficult just now not being able to walk properly and not being able to drive again yet.“I haven’t got full range in my knee yet and I need to have that after 12 weeks and the rehab can start.“It’s been difficult not being able to drive and being on crutches but all that will come back in time.“It makes you appreciate things a lot more.“Being able to walk properly and bend down and drive that’s nothing to do with football, that’s just normal life.“Without taking the fact that you can’t play football or be active it is just normal routine life that has been affected.“It’s getting easier now, but I was basically housebound for a while and it wasn’t easy getting out and about.“It will be easier once I can drive again and take myself to the gym for my rehab. There are people a lot more worse off than me, but getting over that was difficult.“In football you hear about these injuries and you think they’ll never happen to you.“But it’s one of these things. You can’t dwell on it, you have to get on it.”Riley believes one of the biggest challenges in overcoming a long-term injury such as his is dealing with it mentally.He admits it can be difficult to come to terms with, but takes confidence from seeing so many other players bounce back from cruciate ligament injuries to continue to have good careers.Riley added: “With an injury like this the mental side of it is probably just as important as the physical side.“You’re doing the rehab in the gym and that’s you getting physically ready to come back.“But the whole mental side and mentally it can be difficult to deal with.“There are players at all levels of football who have this injury and come back to play so you need to look at these guys.“Those people can given you confidence that they’ve come back.“But it’s a big thing getting over the injury, it’s happened and you need to move on from it and be mentally strong to come back playing.”Riley will remain a Peterhead player next season while he continues his recovery.Being given another contract by the Blue Toon is something he appreciates because many part-time clubs in Scotland would not be willing to keep a player that for a large chunk of next term will be unable to play.Riley is thankful to still be with the Buchan side and already insists his aim is to get back fit and playing to repay the Balmoor club for the support they have given him.He said: “I spoke to the gaffer Jim McInally at the end of the season and he said there was a deal there for me.“Not every club does that and it’s not always the case that you get kept on after an injury.“In Scotland especially, I don’t think there are many teams who would give you that help and give you that support.“I can’t speak highly enough of the club, I’m thankful to the manager but also the club and people like Ian Grant (vice-chairman) and Harry Fraser (a director).“They can’t do enough for you and they’ve given me the support.“I’ve never thought that I would have to stop playing because of this injury and I was hoping to continue with Peterhead.“I know with some clubs it’s not always like that where you get kept on, but I’m thankful Peterhead have kept me on.“Now it’s about trying to get fit and get back playing again to give them something back after giving me the contract.“That’s what I can do for them now is get back playing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ben shows me how guide runners can help out those who need the expertise","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHow do you run one of the north-east’s annual 10K or half-marathon races if you have a sensory impairment which means you can’t run alone?With the help of Ben Mair of Granite City Guide Running and a blindfold, I was given an insight into running when you can’t see.In short – without being guided round the Jesmond Centre sports hall using a short, elasticated tether, I’d have gone nowhere.A reserve of guide runners seems crucial to making sure every person who needs one can find one – and this is Ben’s aim.Ben has been running for over 10 years and hosts information sessions for those with sensory impairments or those interested in being guides. He is trying to raise awareness of the need for these two groups to be brought together.In his words: “It’s not that these people are not out there, they just don’t know who to get in touch with.”His running partner is Leona, who has Usher syndrome.Ben said: “I’d been a runner for 10 years and I was looking to do something to help others but that also fit into my lifestyle.“When I watched the London Marathon in 2017 I saw people guiding and thought it would be a good thing to get into. But when I tried googling information that’s when I realised there is a shortage of it in Scotland, which spurred me on to create the group.“I initially got in touch with North East Sensory Services (NESS), who paired me up with Leona.“She needed a new guide for last year’s Great Aberdeen Run half marathon.“She’s a really strong-willed individual and has done things like climbing Kilimanjaro.“Talking to her she said: ‘This is something we need in the north-east.’”Ben, through the Granite City Guide Running Facebook page and his sessions, is now trying to expose as many people as possible to what guide running entails and how to get started.However, because of Disclosure Scotland legislation designed to protect vulnerable groups, Ben can’t personally introduce prospective guides with sensory-impaired runners.He aims to do this by eventually becoming affiliated with, for example, Grampian Disability Sport.He said: “I’m a point of contact, to find out about guide running and how to get involved.“The long-term aim is to connect people who want to guide with people who need a guide.“At the moment the page is for advice, information and I put on classes (to demonstrate).“I can then put people in touch with NESS or Grampian Disability Sport (who can partner people up).”Ben wants bodies like Scottishathletics and Scottish Disability Sport to make it easier to partner guides and runners, and he’s building evidence to show there is real demand for it. He added: “One thing I am doing is keeping a record of the people who want to guide and the people who need a guide.“So I can go to Scottish Disability Sport and say: ‘you’ve got X amount of people in the north-east alone who want and need this’.“The Facebook page has 170 people who’ve shown an interest.“I’ve had close to 50 people contact me directly saying they want to be guide runners.“There’s been at least a dozen or so (sensory impaired) people who have said this is something they’d look for.”Ben’s next challenge is to get as many people as possible to join him and Leona in taking part in the Great Aberdeen Run. He’s even encouraging non-sensory-impaired pairs to try using a blindfold to understand the challenges a sensory impairment creates.For more information, visit Granite City Guide Running on Facebook.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"readers think matters us give us piece mind","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMaking assumptions about what our readers want is a risky way to make business decisions.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads.

They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"nostalgia-how-horse-power-kept-innerleithen-moving","story":"THIS week, Ross McGinn looks back at Innerleithen\u0026rsquos journey from horses to horse-power engines as a mode of transport...\nWhile much is currently talked about the transition to electric and driverless cars, here we look back to the last transition, in the early 1900s, with a move from horse to fuel-burning, engine-powered vehicles.\nThe High Street Smiddy (pictured below right), now the High Street Garage, was the very core of Innerleithen\u0026rsquos powerhouse.\nEach powerful animal had to be shod and fitted with appropriate pulling tackle.\nNot only was the horse used for its pulling power but many of the smaller breeds were used for leisure purposes.\nAs can be seen in the second photo (bottom right), a family group of riders prepare for a ride from outside Caerlee House in around 1910, no doubt off to explore the many trails by the river and on the hills around the town.\nFeaturing in the various processions of the day \u0026ndash pictured right at the St Ronan\u0026rsquos Games Week in Innerleithen and photographed by Thomas Colledge in 1907 \u0026ndash horse drawn carriages were the limousine of the day for local dignitaries such as the town Provost and Baillies.\nDaily coaches also ran to a time table from Innerleithen to St Mary\u0026rsquos Loch and Tibbieshiels and to the other Border towns of Peebles and Galashiels.\nThe change finally came in the early 1920s, as seen on the High Street in Innerleithen with a car outside the St Ronan\u0026rsquos Hotel (below).\nThereafter the horse and its power was gradually replace by horsepower provided by the internal combustion engine for transport, working the land and of course for leisure.\nIs the day approaching for the next transition?\n"},{"url":null,"title":"line-up-unveiled-for-16th-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"NOW in its 16th year, Innerleithen Music Festival is gearing up for another feast of entertainment later this summer.\nAlways a hit with locals and visitors alike, this year promises to be another super showcase of, not only musical talent, but with other dance and drama events and for the first time ever \u0026ndash an art exhibition.\nFestival-goers can expect the usual great atmosphere and live music from local talent at the Live and Local event in the Vale Of Leithen Social Club throughout the weekend of August 17 to 19.\nHeadliners are soon to be announced, but firm favourites such as Unfinished Business, The IV Drips and Cameron Boak will all be there for your entertainment.\nThis event is Free all weekend and more details will be posted, including the full line up on the Live and Local facebook page.\nThe Friday evening kicks off with Act!

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"keep-calm-its-only-the-common-riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"casting-their-places-in-history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"new-route-planned-for-tonights-melrosians-rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people.

Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements. And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-hosts-world-record-attempt-for-the-slosh-dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

They are one of four one-act plays that will take part in the Scottish Community Drama\u0026rsquos National Youth Drama final in Plockton on Saturday.  The group, who meet in North Berwick\u0027s St Andrew Blackadder Church every Friday, will be performing Evan Placey\u0026rsquos powerful play Girls Like That, which explores the consequences of a naked photo being sent round a school and how this affects, not only the girl in the photo, but the way in which girls react and respond.  Indelible Arts director Linda Grant told the Courier: \"I am so delighted that our talented cast have made it to the SCDA one act festival.  \"It really is a joy to bring all these young people together who have a love of the performing arts and support each other in a very nurturing environment. In particular I am so glad that we have progressed with this play.  \"After a reading the script during one of our sessions the girls were behind it one hundred percent, here was a piece that they could relate to and completely identify with.\"  And some of the cast, pupils at North Berwick High School, are equally looking forward to taking part.  S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!  Heather Fortune, also S6, added: \"Life today as a high school student is displayed perfectly through the contrast between the boys\u0026rsquo reaction to the photo and the girls\u0026rsquo reaction to it.\"  And S4 pupil Abbey Greenwood: \"I have really enjoyed working on this play, I think it really brings people together and opens up discussions on how we treat each other in society.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930043.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"calls-to-tackle-edinburgh-bypass-gridlock-as-tram-system-to-musselburgh-mooted","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS MSP has backed calls for improvements to the Edinburgh City Bypass \u0026ndash while suggesting extending a tram or light rail system to the Honest Toun.  Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.  One parent said: \u0026ldquoThe children are really disappointed but it\u0026rsquos the correct decision."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/5296837.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"common-school-day-across-east-lothian-proposed","story":"              A COMMON secondary school day could be introduced in East Lothian in an effort to ensure pupils have equal access to education.  A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

The men were among the fallen of the First World War whose names, until now, were missing from the University of Glasgow\u0026rsquos Roll of Honour.  Using digital resources and student records, their connection to the university was confirmed.  One of the men was a successful rugby player who was capped for Scotland, while another a respected doctor.  A grocer\u0026rsquos son who cut short his studies to join the war effort and a secondary school teacher are also to be honoured.  Now, 100 years after the war, their names will be carved in stone alongside those of the men and women already remembered in the University Memorial Chapel.  Captain William Campbell Church played for Glasgow Academicals between 1904 and 1907.  He was on the winning team for the Scottish Club Championship 1904/1905 and played for his country against Wales in 1906.  He enrolled at the university in 1905, taking a class in mercantile law and playing for the University rugby team.  A stockbroker who lived in Partick, Glasgow, he enlisted with the 8th Battalion Cameronians.  Captain Church was 32 when he was killed by machine gun fire within ten yards of the enemy trench at Gully Ravine, Gallipoli in 1913.  His body was never found but he was remembered by his friend, Commander J A Henry of the Royal Navy, as \"a good man to play with or against.\"  Captain William Turner set up his medical practice in Saltcoats, Ayrshire after gaining a First Class certificate for Surgery at the University.  When war broke out, the father-of-three joined the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving first in the East before seeing service on the Western Front.  When he returned home he was fighting acute pneumonia which he had contracted on active service and died on April 6, 1918, at the age of 43.  His name was not recorded originally because he died in hospital in England rather than being killed in action.  Private Archibald James Shanks Morrison from Whithorn, Wigtonshire, was the son of a grocer who matriculated in 1916 aged 17.  He studied for one year of a BSc programme but cut short his studies to serve in the King\u0026rsquos Own Scottish Borderers as a Private.  He was killed in action on 23 May 1918 and his memorial is in Tannay, British Cemetery in Thiennes, in Northern France.  Corporal James Crawford Robertson, of Beith, Ayrshire, graduated with an MA (Hons) in Classics in 1913  He went on to train as a teacher at the Glasgow Provincial Training College, now the University of Strathclyde and was appointed a teacher at Shawlands Academy in 1914.  Serving with the 17th Battalion Highland Light Infantry, he was killed in action on 14 July 1916 -- four days before his 23rd birthday.  Katie McDonald, Researcher with the College of Arts, University of Glasgow, said they are still piecing together the stories behind the names of the fallen.  She said: \"In 1929, when the University originally called for names to be inscribed in the Memorial Chapel, the University widely advertised in newspapers, asking families to come forward with names of the fallen.  \"Some people may not have seen the advertisements, or they could have assumed their son or brother or father\u0026rsquos name was already on record.  \"Also, many families found it terribly hard to talk about their losses and may have found it too painful to come forward.  \"Where students studied at more than one institution, some have been remembered in one and not the other.  \"Perhaps an assumption was made by those providing the information that it would be shared, or perhaps it was too hard to relay the news repeatedly.\"  The Scottish War Memorial Project, the Inverclyde Great War Project and the Imperial War Museum\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoLives of the First World War\u0026rsquo project assisted the university.  University Chaplain, Reverend Stuart MacQuarrie said: \"It\u0026rsquos right to honour all of our fallen with their names engraved on an additional stone panel in the Memorial Chapel, which was built to remember the great sacrifice made by the University\u0026rsquos students, staff and alumni during the First World War.  \"We invite all the families, schools, and communities related to the fallen to join us for the memorial services on November 11.\"  John Briggs, Clerk of Senate \u0026amp Vice-Principal of the University of Glasgow, said: \"The stories that have been uncovered about our fallen are both inspiring and profoundly moving.  \"We are humbled and deeply honoured to be able to commemorate their lives in this way, one hundred years after the First World War.  \"Over the course of the war, the University of Glasgow lost 780 members of its community.  \"I am honoured to be involved in our Great War Project, which tells the stories of those from the University who served in the Great War.\""},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7970962.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-nurses-midwives-and-paramedics-offered-pay-rise","story":"              NURSES, midwives and paramedics are to be offered a minimum 9% pay rise over the next three years.

Homeless social enterprise Social Bite\u0026rsquos Sleep in the Park will again take place in Edinburgh, as well as Dundee and Aberdeen on the same night.  The inaugural event on December 9, 2017 saw 8,000 people sleep under the stars on the coldest night of the year on the capital\u0026rsquos West Princes Street Gardens.  The night became the world\u0026rsquos largest ever event of its kind.  Building on the momentum of that event, Sleep in the Park 2018 will hit Glasgow with the venue expected to be the Kelvingrove Bandstand.  Participants will be joined by an impressive lineup of artists before bedding down for a cold night in each city.  Returning for the second year, Amy MacDonald will be joined on the bill by fellow Scot KT Tunstall, and each will be performing in all four cities on the night.  An aircraft has been donated by prominent Glasgow-based businessman Andrew Devlin to provide the flight for the artists to use.  Comedian Fred MacAulay has been announced as the host for the Edinburgh event and acclaimed author Irvine Welsh will perform this year\u0026rsquos bedtime story.  The full lineup for each city including acts, special guests and hosts will be announced in the coming months.  Last year, Liam Gallagher, Deacon Blue and Frightened Rabbit entertained crowds.  Josh Littlejohn MBE, co-founder of Social Bite, described how the event last year raised \u0026ldquoan incredible \u0026pound4 million.  He said: \u0026ldquoEveryone who gave up their beds that night caused a sea change in Scotland\u0026rsquos fight against homelessness and have funded a raft of major projects, including a major \u0026lsquoHousing First\u0026rsquo initiative which is expected to take 800 rough sleepers off the streets by 2020.  \u0026ldquoFor Sleep in the Park 2018, we\u0026rsquore doing something that has never been done before: a simultaneous multi-city sleep out in Scotland\u0026rsquos four largest cities.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore asking for 12,000 people in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee to keep the momentum going and raise \u0026pound6 million.  \u0026ldquoBy organising these events locally, we will invest the funds so that homeless people in those cities are housed and given the support they need to get back on their feet.  \u0026ldquoThe money raised this year will be put towards rapidly rehousing rough sleepers and providing them with support.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll make sure the most vulnerable members of society - like people coming from the care system or prison - don\u0026rsquot end up homeless.  \u0026ldquoThe funds will also go towards a number of other programs that will be a catalyst for long-term structural change.  \u0026ldquoI fundamentally believe the statistics of homelessness in Scotland are not insurmountable.  \u0026ldquoBy collaborating, and treating homelessness as a political priority, Scotland can be a country where everyone has a place to call home.  Housing Minister, Kevin Stewart, added: \u0026ldquoHaving taken part in the event last year, it was amazing to see people come together to help the most vulnerable people in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoPublic support for events like the Sleep Out demonstrates the appetite for change, and the Scottish Government absolutely shares this commitment to ending homelessness.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to see the events being expanded throughout Scotland and I\u0026rsquod encourage everyone to get involved.  Alongside Sleep in the Park, Social Bite is preparing to welcome its first residents to the Social Bite Village in the coming weeks.  Located in Granton, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, the Social Bite Village consists of 11 purpose-built two bedroom homes and a community hub, and will provide a stable and supported communal way of living for 20 people at a time for around 12 to 18 months.  Members of the public can join Sleep in the Park by committing to raise \u0026pound100.

It comes after VTEC \u0026ndash a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin \u0026ndash was forced to axe its contract early after failing to meet cash targets.

The ancient mythical story of Deirdrie and Naoise is also one of the first documenting the shared destiny of the people of Scotland and Ireland.  Now a romantic landmark has been unveiled on the west coast of Scotland in honour of the legend, close to a spot where the couple were said to have found some tranquillity together.  The \u0026ldquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise was officially unveiled at a ceremony on Saturday, attended by Michael Russell MSP and Mark Hanniffy, the Consul General of Ireland to Scotland, along with more than 100 guests and local dignitaries.  The sheiling itself \u0026ndash a Gaelic word for a hut, or collection of huts, once common in wild and lonely places in the hills and mountains \u0026ndash is on the slopes of Beinn Ghlas, near Taynuilt, overlooking Loch Etive, Argyll.  It marks a personal love story as well as it was commissioned by Sam Macdonald, whose wife, Evelyn Day, died of cancer last year, six weeks after being diagnosed. Mr MacDonald, 76, said that when his 83-year-old Irish wife of 50 years was told she did not have long to live, she asked him to build a memorial to mark her favourite story, so famed in Irish mythology.  Mr Macdonald said: \u0026ldquoWe decided on the garden when we knew that time was running out. We came out of the consultants, and after we gathered ourselves together, we started working on some lasting memory.  The tale itself, which links Ireland with Scotland, was first featured in the Glenmasan Manuscript, which is held in the National Library in Edinburgh and has just celebrated its 780th anniversary.  Known as \u0026ldquoDeirdre of the Sorrows, legend has it that before she was born, the most famous woman in Irish mythology was prophesied to become so beautiful, kings and lords would wage war over her. Urged to kill her at birth, King Conchobar of Ulster decided to put her into seclusion until she was old enough for him to take as a wife.  But fate intervened and Deirdre met Naoise, a handsome warrior in the King\u0026rsquos court and the pair fell instantly in love, fleeing to Scotland where they lived a happy life alongside his brothers for a number of years, until word reached them that the King would allow them to return to Ulster. However, upon so doing, Naoise was killed and the distraught Deirdre went on to take her own life.  The President of Ireland, Michael Higgins, was unable to attend the ceremony at the weekend, but sent a message of support, which read: \u0026ldquoThe tragic tale of the two doomed lovers is one of the great tales of an Ruraiocht, the Ulster Cycle, a mythic arc that is the shared inheritance of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland.  \u0026ldquoThere is perhaps no place on our islands more representative of that shared inheritance than Argyll, once the home of the ancient Gaelic Kingdom of Dal Riada. It was there that Cu Chulainn, the warrior-hero of the Ulaid, was said to have learned the arts of war, and it was there that Deirdrie sought sanctuary with Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle.  \u0026ldquoI am so pleased that a magnificent memorial will now rest forever on Beinn Ghlas, not far from Gleann \u0026Egraveite, the place Deirdre and Naoise were said to have found a moment of peace. May it stand as a monument, not only to the common past of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland, but to the shared destiny of our two ancient countries.  The sheiling is on land once owned by Mr Macdonald, now taken over by onshore wind generation firm Ventient Energy. It features within it the statue of Deirdre and Naoise that was originally created by Glasgow School of Art graduate, Fiona McLeod, for Scotland\u0026rsquos National Gardening Show, held in Strathclyde Park in 1997. The golden statue had been in Mr Macdonald\u0026rsquos garden since the show closed.  Visually, the sheiling, situated near one of the turbines on the Ventient Energy wind farm, looks like it has been on the site for 1,000 years due to its historic features, looking across the stunning Scottish landscape to where Deirdre and Naoise were said to live in the 7th Century AD.  Scott Mackenzie, CEO of Ventient Energy, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted to support Sam Macdonald in creating the stunning \u0026lsquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise\u0026rsquo. Its creation is being celebrated by the entire community and is something that can be visited and enjoyed by locals and visitors from further afield, including Ireland.  Mr Macdonald said the stories preserved largely through oral tradition are from a time when \u0026ldquoan aristocratic warrior class dominated, \u0026ldquo characterised by dramatic stories of fighting and adventure on the part of the chiefs.  He said Deirdre\u0026rsquos powerful tale, with its \u0026ldquoelements of lust, treachery and ultimate death, is vividly told and that while one may question whether the characters in the story ever existed, recent research into place names in the North Lorn area of Argyll suggests they may well have done. The findings raised the idea that perhaps Deirdre, Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle were real and did indeed reside in Glen Etive, given the number of place names that memorialise them in the landscape.  In raising the Sheiling for Deirdre and her lover, Mr Macdonald said he hopes to revitalise the ancient myths and reinforce the strong social and cultural ties that link the people of the west Highlands with their Irish neighbours across the water.  He is hopeful it will draw visitors from around the world as well.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos going to be a very romantic spot, he said. \u0026ldquoIt will be lovely if someone proposes there \u0026ndash and there\u0026rsquos the possibility of weddings, as outdoor weddings are very much in vogue now."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-insists-it-has-an-open-ear-to-calls-for-a-second-brexit-referendum","story":"              THE SNP has said it has an \u0026ldquoopen ear to a potential second referendum on the UK\u0026rsquos membership of the European Union, while continuing to fall short of backing one outright.  Ian Blackford, the party\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, insisted its priority was making sure Scotland could stay in the single market and customs union, but added it was \"watching developments\" over the prospect of another EU vote.  He said a hard Brexit would signal a \"clear road map towards a second independence referendum that for me would be the priority\".  It comes as SNP Brexit minister Michael Russell said he was \u0026ldquoabsolutely not hostile to a second vote on any future deal, but suggested the result in Scotland would need to be respected.  He told the BBC: \u0026ldquoThere will have to be a vote at some stage. The question is what vote and when, and how it\u0026rsquos going to be achieved, and presently we don\u0026rsquot have answers to that.

He said: \"What I\u0027m seeking to do is to defend the rights of the Scottish people and the powers that they have in their parliament, that is the immediate priority for us.  \"Of course I would make the point that if we cannot get the UK Government to listen on this then ultimately we will be having a discussion with the people of Scotland as to how we best protect our parliament, I would argue that independence is the best way of doing that.\"  He added: \"We\u0027re not at the moment talking about a timing of an independence referendum, what we have said is that we\u0027ll make a judgment on that once we\u0027ve got to the end of the Brexit process, so we\u0027ll concentrate on making sure we\u0027re standing up for our rights through the Brexit process.  \"We will have that debate with the people of Scotland and the economic future of Scotland, but we will only come back to a discussion on the timing of a referendum once we\u0027ve got through the Brexit process.\"  As Theresa May narrowly won another crunch vote on the Government\u0027s European Union (Withdrawal) Bill last week, Mr Blackford branded the Prime Minister \"very weak\", adding \"at some point that luck will run out\"."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit-uncertainty-could-lead-to-north-sea-missed-opportunity","story":"              UNCERTAINTY surrounding Brexit could result in a \"missed opportunity\" for the North Sea oil and gas industry, MPs have been told.

The committee was taking evidence from a panel of experts at the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen as part of an inquiry into the future of the industry.  Asked about the potential impact of Brexit, the centre\u0027s chief executive Colette Cohen said the industry had to consider the potential cost of leaving the EU and whether it would impact on competitiveness.  She said: \"The biggest challenge for the industry over the next year and certainly one we\u0027re experiencing now is the uncertainty.  \"The industry is a global market, they will make whatever market they are in work or they will withdraw, but uncertainty creates that missed opportunity, whether it\u0027s a missed opportunity in investment right now in the North Sea, whether it\u0027s growth in their current business, whether it\u0027s the ability to secure a contract in another country because of that uncertainty of what the terms may ultimately be in another year.  \"That is the part that is impacting us and that is the part that needs to be sorted out as quickly as possible.\"  Professor Paul de Leeuw, director of the Oil and Gas Institute at Robert Gordon University, added: \"Where we see particularly the biggest issue on Brexit from an oil and gas perspective, and I do not make a political point here, is round the potential impact between what is currently in place and going to WTO (World Trade Organisation) tariff arrangements.  \"We see that as having quite an impact on the supply chain in terms of additional cost.  \"The other one... is access to high quality resources and particularly people, either EU citizens or non EU citizens.\"  Highlighting that about 10% of people working in the industry fell into those categories, he added: \"They are in high value jobs and this industry is relying on access to equipment, is relying on import of goods and services, relying on exporting goods and services and on people so the main thing the industry needs in my view is absolutely frictionless access to it and continuous arrangements in place.  \"Our Vision 2035 relies to a very large extent on exports and actually doing more activities overseas.  \"We need investment particularly in the next few years in the North Sea before the North Sea potentially declines in production post-2020 and actually having investment coming in here, less uncertainties and people not saying \u0027I\u0027m going to wait to see what plays out\u0027 is going to be critical for this industry.\""},{"url":null,"title":"orwell-would-have-loved-this-book-loki-wins-prestigious-literary-prize","story":"              IT has been described as a \"savage, wise and witty tour-de-force\" by JK Rowling, and has been one of the most talked-about books published in Scotland in recent times.

Analysis of two skeletons discovered at the site indicates they suffered a lack of food as children, including periods of starvation.

Today the sun is shining and it\u0027s still beautiful.\u0026nbsp  \"I\u0027m very honoured with this recognition. I did not think this would happen when we opened the Traverse all those years ago.\"\u0026nbsp  Louisiana-born Haynes, who arrived in Scotland while enlisted in the US air force, established the Traverse\u0027s continuing policy that it would be a theatre for writers which only produced new plays.

During a discussion exploring the \"theatre of the future\", a \u0027happening\u0027 was stage, which included an 18-year-old Ms Kesselaar being wheeled out across a balcony, naked and clinging to a lighting trolley,  It was only a glimpse of flesh, but it led to her being put on trial for indecency in a case dubbed the \"Lady MacChatterley trial\".  The charges were later thrown out, but the young model was said to have been hounded out of Edinburgh by the fallout, settling in |London for the rest of her life.    Anna Kesselaar was acquitted during the trial  Mr Haynes said: \"The word which was in the air at the time was \u0027a happening\u0027, and it was decided once would be staged during the conference.\u0026nbsp  \"There was an actress who walked across the backs of the seats and people crawling about on the roof, while Anna Kesselaar was wheeled along the balcony above people\u0027s heads. \u0026nbsp  \"The press gallery was opposite and it became the thing they focussed on.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspThere\u0027s 50 shades of variety as Traverse gets things write  In 1966 Haynes moved to London where he co-founded the International Times alternative newspaper with Barry Miles and John Hopkins.

After relocating to Paris in 1969, Mr Haynes taught media studies and sexual politics at the University of Paris for 30 years, and found more fame with his open-house Sunday dinners.  As publisher with his Handshake Editions imprint, he brought forth work by authors such as Beat Poet Ted Joans and John Calder among others.  Mr Hayne\u0027s old friend Richard Demarco said: \"His arrival in Edinburgh changed the city for the better, and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s ever recovered from his presence.\"  Poking fun at genteel society in the capital, Mr Demarco - who paid Ms Kesselaar \u0026pound4 to take part in the conference \u0027happening\u0027 - added: \"He had a huge impact on the Edinburgh Festival.  \"After his Drama\u0027 Conference, Edinburgh had to deal with the reality of female nudity by confronting, for 2-3 seconds, her[Anna Kesselaar\u0027s] beautiful nude body.\"  He said that Mr Hayne\u0027s fully deserved recognition from Napier University, and called for him to be given greater honours as well.

Keryn Laver, of Oakley, near Dunfermline, needed urgent help to deliver the baby after her waters broke while her husband Jules was rushing her to the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy.  Now she has been reunited with the Scottish Ambulance Service paramedics who helped bring little Keldan into the world and said: It was a very, very memorable birth and I am absolutely pleased it turned out the way it did. We are lucky it was very straight forward.  The day of Keldan\u0026rsquos birth had an extra special significance for Keryn it was the day her brother, Cedric, passed away in 2009 after a sailing accident.  While the birth of her first child Torin three years ago took\u0026nbsp27 hours, baby number two due on March 11 was a very different story.    At around 8pm, four days before the baby was due, the 39-year-old phoned Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy to say that contractions had started and were happening around every two minutes.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe hospital told me to get in fast. The contractions got closer together and I phoned a babysitter.  \u0026ldquoI told them \u0026lsquoyou will have to come here very quickly \u0026ndash the baby is coming. I was sitting on the couch at home, and my husband Jules was with me.  \u0026ldquoThe babysitter took about 20 minutes to arrive \u0026ndash the contractions were coming so fast and then my water broke as I was getting into the car. We were in the car and I was screaming. My husband started driving me to hospital.  \u0026ldquoAround 0.8 miles down the road, there was a little layby near the Carnock Inn. It was a little layby, but it still big enough to get two cars in.  \u0026ldquoJules called 999 at around 8.45pm \u0026ndash they could hear me in the background. I was in the front seat and I still had my jeans on. The call taker asked Jules if he could see anything, whether I was dilated or if he could see the baby\u0026rsquos head.  \u0026ldquoThey said they would send an ambulance as quickly as they could. The ambulance came around the corner and must have heard me from the car.  As she was put on to the stretcher by paramedics Andrew Paterson and Richard Garside, based at Dunfermline, the baby\u0026rsquos head was out.  But the paramedic crew, on their first job for the night, helped deliver the baby at 9.03pm, perfectly healthy, at 8lb 6oz.    Mrs Laver added: \u0026ldquoHolding this little baby, I was full of joy. I think for my husband it was a huge relief that he did not have to deliver it. He had to drive himself to the hospital, but he saw the baby being born.  \u0026ldquoJules took some time to compose himself, he was keeping it together, but it was so close to him having to deliver the baby in the car. He had to keep calm, but once the crew arrived, he could enjoy the birth and then all the emotions hit.  Keryn said it was a \u0026ldquototally different experience to the birth of her first child.  She explained: \u0026ldquoWith my first baby, I didn\u0026rsquot know what to expect, and it was a really long labour. I prefer a quick birth.  After her second birth, she said she could have been home that night but she was kept in Victoria overnight, arriving home the next morning.  Keryn continued: \u0026ldquoThe crew was really surprised, and they were very good with both of us they were joking with me, and supportive of Jules. They gave me whatever I needed.  Mr Paterson also gave Keldan a knitted beanie, made by the paramedic\u0026rsquos grandmother, and kept in the back of the ambulance for such occasions.  Now, the Oakley mum said March 7 has a different meaning these days, adding: \u0026ldquoIt changes a bitter day and turns it into a happy day.  \u0026ldquoEvery time his birthday comes around, we will tell the story \u0026ndash it will be told at his 21st birthday.  \u0026ldquoTorin was quite pleased to meet his baby brother. It took a while to realise it happened so quickly.  In memory of her brother, Keryn named her second child Keldan Cedric Laver.  She said her friends, once hearing of the birth, were shocked and couldn\u0026rsquot believe the location of the birth.  As a thank you, the mum sent the crew a card to thank them and let them know Keldan was healthy.  Mrs Laver said after meeting the paradmedics: \u0026ldquoIt was great to see Richard and Andy again. In the card I sent, I thanked them for helping our baby boy into the world.\"    Keldan\u0026rsquos birth certificate lists the location as Carnock Road.  Mr Garside, who has since been seconded to Helimed 76 as an air ambulance paramedic, said: \u0026ldquoIt was our first job of the night.  \u0026ldquoAs the patient was in a car, in a layby, in labour we knew the birth was imminent so we got there quickly.  \u0026ldquoWe were just in time to be able to get mum into the ambulance where the baby was born. A couple of minutes slower and the baby would have been born in the car footwell. All went well and the baby got a wee hat knitted by Andy\u0026rsquos gran."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/1183159.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scrapping-trident-need-not-cost-scottish-jobs-new-study-shows","story":"              THE Faslane-based nuclear weapons deterrent could be disarmed without massive job losses, according to an independent report published today.  The Nuclear Education Trust, a think-tank and charity, says their conclusion is drawn from evidence from defence diversification projects around the world.  The report recommends that workers and communities must take the lead in making decisions for moving away from Trident \"but a broad partnership involving all stakeholders is necessary for success\".    Funding must be available not just for putting a plan into action but for organising, analysis of the situation, planning and then implementation, the charity said.  Peter Burt, Nuclear Education Trust Board trustee said: \u0026ldquoOur independent analysis of international experience of defence diversification tells us that a government needs to be proactive in getting the conditions right for a successful transition from skilled defence jobs to those in the equally skilled, civil sector. Those conditions include complete stakeholder participation including workers and communities, and national, regional and local political support. Proactive planning and comprehensive funding, with continued learning for effective implementation are essential for success.  \"Many defence industry jobs are at risk from automation, global supply chains, changes in strategic thinking as well as the sheer cost of the work in today\u0027s austere financial climate. The Nuclear Education Trust calls on the current and future governments to make use of the findings of this research and integrate them into an effective defence diversification policy, part of a comprehensive industrial strategy.\"  Fabian Hamilton, MP, shadow minister for peace and disarmament said: \"While it is not yet Labour Party policy to scrap Trident, I am committed, not only to transitioning away from nuclear weapons, but to protecting jobs at the same time.  \"High-skilled jobs are good for our economy and, if we decide to transition away from Trident, defence diversification is the only way to ensure that the vital skills used in the development of Britain\u0027s nuclear weapons are not lost.  TUC deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said: \"The UK\u0027s defence capability will always need to change over time to safeguard against new threats in a changing world. When decisions are made, it\u0027s important to protect and prioritise good quality UK jobs and the communities linked to the defence industry. Unions and the workforce should have a say in creating new opportunities for highly skilled workers in defence and other advanced manufacturing and engineering industries.\"  The report is launched in Parliament at 4pm on Tuesday."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-yes-immigration-is-a-good-thing","story":"              I SOMETIMES wonder why we call them \u0026ldquoleaders, when the evidence suggests that most politicians are remarkably slow to catch up with popular opinion. Take, for example, the EU\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoemergency summit on migration, which has been convened just as immigration from illegal crossings of the Mediterranean and asylum claims have reached their lowest level for years.  The impetus for these talks is not the genuine refugee crisis that faced European countries several years ago, when Angela Merkel blithely introduced an open-door policy that has seen about 1.4 million migrants arrive in Germany since 2015. That, incidentally, created a huge upsurge in human trafficking, deaths at sea and an enormous headache for the southern European countries, especially Italy, to which many migrants headed. While that was at its peak, Mrs Merkel carried on as if there were no problem.  Now that she is dependent on her coalition partners, the anti-immigration Christian Social Union, it\u0026rsquos her political prospects that are in danger rather than piffling matters such as the lives of refugees or the cultural stability of Europe. The issue has naturally become much more pressing. It\u0026rsquos par for the course, I suppose, that the political priorities of the leader of a comfortable Western country should trump (I use the word advisedly) the desperation of those who come from places torn apart by war, governed by oppressive regimes, or devoid of opportunities to make a decent living. Yet migration has become a uniquely divisive issue, for reasons which often seem thoroughly irrational.  The EU summit has already been boycotted by four EU countries \u0026ndash the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia \u0026ndash where immigration is a significant populist issue, while Italy has produced proposals which aim to end the link between a migrant\u0026rsquos point of arrival and the responsibility for dealing with his or her asylum claim.  Given that Italy has had to deal with the results of Mrs Merkel\u0026rsquos implied \u0026ldquocome one, come all rhetoric, that\u0026rsquos understandable but it will horrify other EU leaders, many of whom face growing electoral discontent over immigration. It could also create further problems for freedom of movement within the EU \u0026ndash one of the \u0026ldquofour fundamental freedoms.  In fact, despite Schengen\u0026rsquos supposed guarantee of free movement, the migrant crisis has already led to internal restrictions despite the EU\u0026rsquos objections border controls were instituted between Denmark and Sweden for several years.  Yet the EU\u0026rsquos talk of freedom of movement, rather like its talk of its single market, disguises the underlying problem, which is that neither its movements nor its markets are in any sense genuinely free. On the contrary they are protectionist measures which create barriers to those outside (which means, of course, most of the rest of the world, and the developing world in particular).  Before the First World War, in a world of many more borders and nation states, there were few obstacles to travel and resettlement, passports and border controls were a rarity and naturalisation for longstanding residents was a mere formality. The United States, where Donald Trump is disgustingly and dishonestly weaponising debate on the subject, owes its existence and success entirely to immigration.  Part of the reason this approach is working with so many Trump voters, and is also gaining support for similarly unsavoury populists such as Marine Le Pen in France and Viktor Orban in Hungary, is, it must be said, the reluctance of Western political elites to countenance discussion of the issue, and their implication that anyone who raises concerns about immigration is a racist. It\u0026rsquos only eight years, remember, since Gordon Brown airily dismissed Gillian Brown, one of his own supporters, as a \u0026ldquobigoted woman for raising the matter.  The reason this attitude was so dangerous was that it concealed the facts about immigration and conflated the issue with a quite separate one, which is to do with multi-culturalism and globalisation. Racism in Britain, though it certainly exists, is fortunately confined to a (dwindling) minority.  Immigration, despite the noise about it, is also a minority concern, even among Leave voters not a single poll found it cited as the major factor in the Brexit referendum.  But it is a very bad thing that it has not been properly discussed, because the evidence in favour of immigration is overwhelmingly positive, while the objections to it are largely about issues such as integration, welfare, schools and the provision of social housing.  Immigrants contribute considerably more to the economy than they cost (one report found European Economic Area migrants put in 34 per cent more in tax than they claimed in welfare payments). One obvious example of their contribution is the NHS, where more than one quarter of the doctors employed are from overseas. One consequence of Theresa May\u0026rsquos misinterpretation of Brexit (which she opposed) as being primarily about immigration (which most Leave voters did not list as a priority) is to endanger not only healthcare but also all manner of other areas of our economy.  Agriculture, education, and the technology sector, for example, are all highly dependent on migrant workers or overseas students. And the decline in the birthrate in Western countries, and their ageing populations, ought to make importing people to contribute to pensions a priority.  What\u0026rsquos more, a welcoming approach towards immigration ought to be the natural position for a party which claims to support economic growth, a free society and open markets. From a truly liberal perspective, immigration policy shouldn\u0026rsquot even be a matter for the Government but for the market. After all, if people choose to come to the UK, it is because they see it as an opportunity for themselves and their families and, if they choose to stay, they become British anyway.  Businesses and immigrants themselves are best placed to determine whether migration is in their mutual interest, which is why the idea of having some number plucked from the air, with no reference to need or desirability, fixed as a cap is absurd. The Home Secretary\u0026rsquos announcement that the default position of the UK would be to grant settled status to EU nationals living here was welcome, if belated, but did not go far enough.  Politicians should be making the case that immigration is not a problem but a boon, while populist rhetoric about crime or welfare should be rebutted vigorously. If the EU leaders have not wanted to discuss the issue until now, the least they can do is point out that the facts disprove the claims of those opposed to immigration."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-steps-up-call-for-sewel-convention-to-become-law","story":"              THE SNP Government will today ramp up its demand to have the Sewel convention made legally binding, as it appeals to other parties to defend the devolution settlement.  The 20-year-old Sewel Convention says Westminster will \u0026ldquonot normally legislate in devolved areas without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.  The UK Government breached it for the first time last week, pressing ahead with the EU Withdrawal Bill at Westminster in spite of Holyrood withholding its consent by 90 votes to 30.  The convention is not a law, merely a political agreement, and cannot be enforced in court.  However SNP ministers are now demanding that it be converted into law, something which would effectively give Holyrood a veto over a number of Westminster Bills.  Although this is likely to prove politically and constitutionally impossible, the SNP has threatened to withhold consent from other Brexit-related Bills unless the demand is met, setting the scene for a series of confrontations with London in the autumn.  Brexit minister Michael Russell said: \u0026ldquoThe UK Government\u0026rsquos position of ignoring or over-riding the views of the Scottish Parliament has been a consistent pattern since the EU referendum two years ago. This can\u0026rsquot go on.  \u0026ldquoThey have ignored votes on protecting Scotland\u0026rsquos relationship with the EU triggering Article 50, retaining our place in the Single Market and Customs Union and have now passed legislation on devolved matters for the first time without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.  \u0026ldquoI believe we need to revisit the issue of a proper statutory footing for the Sewel Convention, as recommended by the cross-party Smith Commission after the independence referendum.  \u0026ldquoToday we are holding a debate without a motion and vote because, in stark contrast to Westminster, I want to hear from all parties on how we can protect the Scottish Parliament and ensure the views of the people of Scotland are respected, and not ignored in the Brexit process as they have been up until now."},{"url":null,"title":"economy-secretary-out-in-sturgeon-reshuffle","story":"              NICOLA Sturgeon has\u0026nbspstarted reshuffling\u0026nbspher cabinet, with Economy Secretary Keith Brown leaving to focus on campaigning for independence.

The First Minister, who returned to Scotland from a trade mission in Berlin this morning, will announce her full ministerial team this afternoon.  The normal early Tuesday meeting of the Scottish cabinet has been cancelled.  The beleaguered Health Secretary Shona Robison is seen as the most likely change at the top, however she may be moved sideways rather than sacked.

Quality Pork Limited in Brechin, Angus, will carry out its last slaughter at 4pm due to a lack of the gas used to stun animals before they are killed.  There are plans to send around 1,000 pigs to another plant near Manchester this week, but operators say the CO2 shortage could have serious implications if the shortage continues.  Beer, fizzy drinks and meat producers have all warned of possible shortages caused by a lack of the gas as the UK enters peak consumption amid World Cup festivities and high summer temperatures.  In a statement, the soft drinks giant said: \"We are currently responding to an industry-wide issue that is impacting the supply of C02 in the UK. Our focus is on limiting the effect this may have on the availability of our products.  \"We are working closely with our suppliers, partners and customers on a number of solutions as the situation develops.\"  Supermarket Morrisons said some frozen products had been affected by the shortage, and it aimed to resume selling its full online range \"as soon as possible\".  Quality Pork Limited operates in collaboration with UK-wide meat processor Tulip and the Scottish Pig Producers (SPP) co-operative, whose chief executive, Andy McGowan, said the industry was facing an unprecedented situation.  Mr McGowan said he did not know when to expect the next CO2 delivery from supplier BOC.  He said: \"That\u0027s the frustrating thing - they\u0027re not telling us anything. We\u0027re pretty dismayed.  \"The top priority is animal welfare - we will not have ourselves in a situation where the welfare is suffering.\"  British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) chief executive Nick Allen said the situation was getting \"pretty tight\", exacerbated by the hot temperatures.  Mr Allen said: \"The frustration is the lack of information. We understand that several (CO2) producers are reopening plants and restarting production, but getting information is very difficult, which makes it very difficult to plan.  \"Things are getting pretty tight and this hot weather won\u0027t be helping. If things don\u0027t alter this week, we\u0027re going to see people having to make some serious decisions, mainly in the pig production area.\"  Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a \"potentially huge effect\" on British food production.  The shortages are understood to have been caused by a longer than usual break in production of ammonia, one of the key sources of food grade CO2 in Europe - which is used to carbonate drinks and preserve some packed fresh foods.  Trade journal Gas World said the shortage had been described as the \"worst supply situation to hit the European carbon dioxide (CO2) business in decades\".  The UK has been hit particularly hard as only one major CO2 plant was operating earlier this week and imports from the continent have been affected by shut-downs in Benelux and France.  The British Soft Drinks Association said the shortage was continuing to affect a wide range of businesses across the food and drink sector."},{"url":null,"title":"ofcom-give-green-light-to-new-bbc-scotland-channel","story":"              THE new BBC digital channel for Scotland has been given the final green light by broadcasting watchdog Ofcom.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour.

All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster. After Hugh retired, Des and the late Mary Somerville took over before handing over to the present incumbent, Duncan Winfield, and wife Gail.One incident in particular has stayed with Murray and harks back to his early days on his rounds. When arriving at the late Annie Bain\u0026rsquos place on the Smerlie road he was implored to catch a ewe that had got loose.Murray jumped the fence and caught it as Annie almost simultaneously thrust her arm up its rear to pull out a new lamb and straight back in for another.After a quick wipe down of the livestock he was then asked if there was anything in the post, almost as if nothing had happened in the previous five minutes. Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Temporary reprieve for public toilets welcomed","story":"CLOSURE-threatened public toilets in Caithness and other parts of the Highlands have won a temporary reprieve.Highland Council has decided to put its plan on hold until a review of toilet provision in its area is carried out \u0026ndash but it will not be completed until October.In the meantime, the toilets threatened with closure will remain open.The local authority proposed closing 28 of the 96 public toilets in the Highlands while charging 50p for those that stay open. The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers.

The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I came here in 2016 and part of what drew me was the juxtaposition of a cultural and natural heritage site. Inverewe House was always a Gaelic-speaking place and there\u0026rsquos something about the spirit of the place which is inspirational.\"I\u0026rsquove always wanted this place to help grow the community and be part of it and we have a number of other events planned.\"The festival commemorates Iain \"Dall\" MacAoidh (1656-1754), piper to Mackenzie of Gairloch. Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions. Chairman Ian Blake of Aultgrishan said it was an exciting setting for competitors and \"will provide visitors to the gardens with a unique opportunity to hear some of the most gifted young inheritors of our much cherished Highland heritage\". Entries are now open in a variety of classes. He can be contacted at emailing mackenzie@iambik.orgMeanwhile Inverewe is anticipating the bursting into colour of a Puya alpestris, which resembles a giant asparagus, for the first time in seven years.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Funding for the project is about to run out as Heritage Lottery funding and West Highland College funding dries up.They face a funding shortfall because they cannot charge commercial rates while the boats are built by students who are being tutored.One supporter, Alison MacLeod said: \"Both Ruairidh and Niall said Am Bata was the best thing they did in 13 years at school.\"A spokesman\u0026nbsp for Am B\u0026agraveta: \"To continue offering this fantastic experience, we must raise \u0026pound15,000 annually in addition to the monies we raise through our commissions.\"This money is primarily used to pay for the professional tuition Mark provides.\"To donate or find out more about the project visit\u0026nbsp www.justgiving/crowdfunding/plocktonboatbuildingTuesday 26 Jun 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We used a horse here because of the minimal environmental impact it would have and, to be honest, you\u0026rsquod hardly know they\u0026rsquod been here. He weighs about a ton and can pull up to 600kg.\"The timber will be used to make a bandstand-style shelter to expand community use of the wood. Potential uses include ceilidhs and wedding ceremonies.Pupils at Tain Royal Academy meanwhile have been peeling the wood using special tools.The local Co-op also chipped in with drinks, a stall and a raffle while greenwood crafters found themselves busy all day making a variety of items.It promises to be a busy summer at Evanton with the woods playing a part in a number of school holiday courses operated through High Life Highland.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Tuesday 26 Jun 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.
