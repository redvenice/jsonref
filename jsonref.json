It\u0027s a human story. We need to pay attention to history in order to move forward. What is the cost of survival for the survivor?

He showed me a series of a dozen photographs Jamie Kelman, the prosthetics and make-up designer, had taken of him during the course of filming.How were the changes achieved? Kelman took care of ageing, bruising and scars. \u0027But the weight loss and gain had to be real,\u0027 Foster said. \u0027They said they had the computer technology to take care of that and I said: \u0027Well, you have the wrong actor.\u0027He lit a cigar then continued: \u0027We made a verbal agreement with Barry and Aaron not to go digital, because the body has to tell the narrative. I dropped 60lb for the first fight in the camps. It was a progressive diet and it took five months before we started filming. There is a science to it. There were nutritionists and trainers involved, because we had to go to the limit of what was physically possible. Then I had to put it all back on again, in order to be a heavyweight.\u0027Foster grimaced when I asked about the agonies involved. \u0027Agony is definitely the wrong word to use. I came home to a hotel each night, with a nice bed.\u0027This is luxury. I lost and gained weight in luxury.

In writing it, Elton said he and his collaborators have taken influence from gospel, country and rock ’n’ roll.The key for Elton was that while most Christian preachers lashed out at gays, Tammy had a ‘willingness to preach acceptance, amid a world that was so quick to pass judgment...we were struck by her huge generosity of spirit’.He added he felt she had been treated unkindly. ‘We realised that theirs was a real life, rags-to-riches story, played out against the backdrop of evangelism in 80’s America,’ Elton told me of the woman who became Tammy Faye Bakker Messner after remarrying.         Tammy Faye Messner poses for a photo with her former husband Jim Bakker. Messner died after a long battle with cancer on Friday, July 20, 2007         The rock superstar told me yesterday how he and the Scissor Sisters’ Jake Shears spent the past eight years studying the life and times of Tammy Faye, pictured in 1996He said he’d always been fascinated by ‘the point where TV evangelism and entertainment meet’.‘The charisma, the persuasion, the unabashed entertainment the ability of television in America to successfully deliver religion right into the homes of the nation,’ he marvelled. ‘The explosion of this culture with the ascension of Ronald Reagan to the White House is the perfect backdrop to tell the story of Tammy Faye.’During the early years of their relationship, Tammy Faye sang gospels and played the accordion while Rev Jim preached.She electrified congregations with her elaborately coiffed hair, those signature eyelashes, lashings of eyeliner and extravagant couture clothes. The Bakkers’ Praise the Lord (PTL) ministry raked in tens of millions of dollars.         ‘The charisma, the persuasion, the unabashed entertainment the ability of television in America to successfully deliver religion right into the homes of the nation,’ Elton John saidAnd the Lord told the couple to spend it lavishly, on themselves.The Bakkers revelled in the trappings of tasteless opulence. They had a gold-plated bathroom, a 50ft walk-in clothes closet a private jet his-and-hers Rolls-Royces, and an air-conditioned kennel (the pair even threw a wedding ceremony for Tammy’s Yorkshire terrier and poodle).For Jim’s birthday in 1987, Tammy Faye announced, on their show, that she was buying him a pair of giraffes.David Furnish, Elton’s husband, worked with Joseph Smith, who runs the couple’s Rocket Stage ision of their Rocket Entertainment empire, to put on a reading in London of the Tammy Faye musical.         For Jim’s birthday in 1987, Tammy Faye announced, on their show, that she was buying him a pair of giraffes. They are pictured together in 1989Smith noted that a full workshop will be staged later in the year, and that they’re working towards a production opening in London in the second part of 2020.He stressed that the show is ‘not a lampoon of religion’. Martin Koch, the celebrated orchestrator and music supervisor, oversaw the reading.He worked with Elton and Stephen Daldry on Working Title’s musical Billy Elliot. A director will be contracted soon. Elton was at the Cannes Film Festival for last night’s world premiere (out of competition) of Rocketman, director Dexter Fletcher’s terrific big screen musical that explores Elton’s demons and the dark side of showbiz.The film, from producer Matthew Vaughn, stars Taron Egerton (sublime) as the singer with Richard Madden as John Reid, Jamie Bell as Bernie Taupin and Bryce Dallas Howard as Elton’s mum Sheila.There’s a lot of faith in Tammy Faye, who died in 2007, at the moment.Jessica Chastain and Andrew Garfield will portray the Bakkers in a film that will shoot this year. "},{"url":null,"title":"The Bob Hawke Australias best loved PM known for","story":"Share this article\u0027A Bob Hawke today would have never become PM.

While they had vastly superior resources, most of their forces were not fighting on home ground.”Dr Mansergh was the chief speaker at the national centenary commemoration to mark the rescue of Seán Hogan at Knocklong railway station on May 13th, 1919.Hogan was the youngest of those involved in the Soloheadbeg ambush in January of that year. He was picked up after a dance in Tipperary town and put on a train from Thurles to Cork. He faced certain interrogation and possible execution.He was rescued from the train by a group of IRA volunteers including Seán Treacy and Dan Breen following a ferocious gun battle which lasted 15 minutes. Two Royal Irish Constabulary, Sergeant Peter Wallace and Constable Michael Enright were killed in the rescue.IRA volunteersSaturday’s gathering at Knocklong Community Field in the Co Limerick village was the culmination of a week of events to mark the centenary of the rescue. The programme included a series of four plays covering the dance, the plan, the rescue and the trial of two IRA volunteers who were executed in 1921 for their role in the rescue.Dr Mansergh reminded those present in Knocklong that Seán Hogan’s father Matthew had been a tenant of Dr Mansergh’s great-grandfather before his lands were sold under the Wyndham Act of 1903.Dr Mansergh described the targeting of Irish-born RIC men as “one of the tragic necessities of the time even though most of them were decent and honourable men during their duty by their lights.”He contrasted the fight that hundreds of thousands of Irishmen had been in during the First World for the values of the rights of small nations and national self-determination with the refusal of the British to grant the same self-determination to Ireland.The end of the war had provided a “unique opportunity” to claim independence for Ireland.“It was an opportunity that might never have recurred or that would not have been feasible later on,” he said.“Painful though the cost of revolution may have been on all sides, the bloodshed during the entire Irish revolution was relatively low compared to the civil wars in Europe after the end of the Great War, low compared to Irish casualties in that war, and low compare to the loss of life in the 1798 rebellion or the conflicts of the 16th and 17th centuries in Ireland.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3897102.1558176874!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"redevelopment of greystones harbour prevents fishermen landing catches","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA protest at Greystones harbour over the prevention of commercial fishermen landing catches since a €300 million redevelopment.   Fishermen in Greystones, Co Wicklow, claim they are unable to land catches following a €300 million redevelopment of the local harbour for housing and a marine leisure quarter.While some concerns had been raised about the smell of commercial fishing activity in the harbour, the fishermen and locals believe these could have been overcome.New three-story €1 million terraced homes in the €300 million redeveloped harbour district are now on sale beside a marina with berths for 250 leisure craft, rowing and angling club, a new town square, a public park and a beach.However, the redeveloped harbour has no facilities for commercial fishermen, generations of whom have worked out of the Co Wicklow town since Victorian times.Ten fishermen, who had access to sheds in the old harbour, lost harbour mooring they had enjoyed when the redevelopment went ahead, despite 9,000 objections to Wicklow County Council.The fishermen were promised new arrangements, and the ones who had used sheds in the harbour were compensated when construction works began. One who had used a former ladies’ lavatory on the pier as a shed was paid €40,000.Fishermen Ivan Toole, Tim Storey, Peter Ryan and others insist they will land their catches on the beach at Greystones Harbour, in protest at the restriction on commercial fishing.Saying fishermen feel badly treated, Mr Toole told The  they had agreed with the developers – Wicklow County Council and the Sispar Consortium – that space would be provided for them.However, this space was subsequently used for a boat hoist and a commercial boat yard on the south pier. After the harbour was opened, they were offered “swing” moorings on chains connected to the sea bed within the harbour.These were not considered safe by them.An alternative solution involving berths inside the north pier alongside the marina was considered but as fishermen awaited keys to the marina the cleats to secure their boats were removed and they were told the arrangement was cancelled, Mr O’Toole said.Mr Storey said he paid for a berth in the marina for a year, but was told not to load or unload his catch and not to store bait. Most of the commercial fishing boats have now moved to Dun Laoghaire or Wicklow town’s harbour.Independent councillor Tom Fortune supports the fishermen. “Anyone that knows any history of Greystones knows that Greystones was always a fishing port, so it beggars belief that you would redevelop the harbour and exclude any facilities to facilitate the fishing tradition of the town”.Fine Gael councillor Derek Mitchell said it was “unfortunate” there was nowhere in the harbour for the fishermen. Mr Mitchell said the harbour was originally supposed to have a place for commercial fishermen.“When An Bord Pleanála refused the first design the redesign eliminated that space but nobody noticed, even among the 3,000 people who made submissions,” he said.Mr Mitchell said the chain moorings had been laid out at a cost of €36,000, including one suitable for up to 20 tonnes . But he said a dispute arose over insurance and maintenance and the moorings were taken away again.Saying some compromise should be made, Mr Mitchell added: “Ivan Toole had a boat and had to leave when work started on the harbour, as he was using the harbour at that time. If facilities cannot be provided he should be compensated”.He acknowledged concerns had been voiced about the smell surrounding fish landing, but thought these could have been overcome.“Boat parks, clubhouses and good public launching facilities have been provided to the anglers, rowers, ers, sailors and sea scouts.

So far, China has lost about 20 per cent of its breeding herd,” she said.She added:“The fever is in every single province in China and it’s also in Cambodia and Vietnam. It’s spreading and nothing has been put in place to stop it. The Chinese authorities have reportedly brought in a requirement to test animals when they arrive in the abattoir but there are still a hell of a lot of animals being transported all over China and very few controls on transport and biosecurity.”Richard Brown, director of Gira, an industry analyst, said that African swine fever was set to have as big an impact on the worldwide meat industry as BSE.“The Chinese eat far more pork than any other protein. A very large number of pigs are going to die because this is a naive herd – they’ve never been exposed to this disease. In China, pigs are reared largely in backyard and small family farms and there is little biosecurity. The Chinese government was slow to accept they had African swine fever and because they haven’t compensated farmers people have not admitted they have it,” he said.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleHe added that Chinese pork production is set to reduce by about 13 million tons this year - about the same amount of pork that the US produces every year.About 60 per cent of the pork consumed in the UK is from Europe, said Dr Davies, so price rises will eventually hit the UK.She added that price rises may bite sooner in restaurants, hotels and other food outlets, the majority of whose pork is imported.“Some indications have shown that in the first quarter of this year the price has gone up by about 40p a kilo which is a massive price hike,” she said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Pandemics and epidemicsAustralian Labor leaders resigns as he concedes shock election defeatUS spy challenge offers $250k to those who can accurately forecast future eventsLady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston\u0026#39s royal wedding: couple share a kiss after marrying in St George\u0026#39s ChapelComment: Tories and Labour are despised over Brexit – but there is a path out of this democratic crisisPrince Harry leaves Meghan at home with baby Archie as he attends Lady Gabriella Windsor\u0026#39s wedding to Tom KingstonAustria coalition in chaos as far-Right vice chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache forced to resign over Russian oligarch claimsEuropean elections latest polls: Brexit Party forecast to win most votesOn the Brexit Party campaign trail with Nigel FarageThe Brexit Party: What do they stand for, and who are the MEP candidates running for election? European elections 2019: Full list of MEP candidates How to vote for your MEP in the European electionsEuropean elections 2019: What date does the UK vote - and why are we even taking part?Lady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston\u0026#39s wedding: who are the royal couple getting married in Windsor today?Comment: It\u0026#39s not too late for the Conservative Party to bounce back Comment: Steve Baker is the determined, principled leader we need in these troubled timesComment: Lights, camera, action.

But she predicted a tighter result as counting progressed.The only thing you can say about tonight is it\u0027s likely to be a very late night, Plibersek said.It was not clear whether the results would be available by the end of vote counting on Saturday.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison casts his vote alongside wife Jenny, on Election day, at Lilli Pilli Public School, in SydneyOpinion polls had suggested that the conservative Liberal Party-led coalition would lose its bid for a third three-year term, and that Scott Morrison would have had one of the shortest tenures as prime minister in the 118-year history of the Australian federation.Mr Shorten had said on Saturday morning that he was confident Labor would win, but Morrison would not be drawn on a prediction.Morrison is the conservatives\u0027 third prime minister since they were first elected in 2013. He replaced Malcolm Turnbull in a leadership ballot of government colleagues in August.Tony Abbott, who became the first of the three conservative prime ministers in the 2013 election, conceded defeat in the Sydney seat he has held since 1994. The good news is that there is every chance that the Liberal-National coalition has won this election, Abbott said.Bill Shorten, leader of the Labor Party of Australia, center, and his wife Chloe Shorten, arrive to vote at a polling station in AdelaidePolling suggests climate change was a major issue in the seat for voters, who elected an independent candidate, Zali Steggall. As prime minister in 2014, Abbott repealed a carbon tax introduced by a Labor government. Abbott was replaced by Turnbull the next year because of poor opinion polling, but he remained a government lawmaker.  Morrison began the day Saturday by campaigning in the island state of Tasmania, where the Liberals were making gains in Labor-held seats. He then flew 900 kilometers (560 miles) home to Sydney to vote and to campaign in Sydney seats.Shorten contained his campaigning to polling centers in his hometown of Melbourne, where he voted Saturday morning.He said early in the day that he expected that Labor would start governing from Sunday. He said his top priorities would be to increase wages for low-paid workers, hike pay rates for working Sundays and reduce Australia\u0027s greenhouse gas emissionsShorten has been campaigning hard on more ambitious targets to reduce Australia\u0027s greenhouse gas emissions.Scientists queue up to vote at Australia\u0026#39s  Davis research station in AntarcticaShorten, a 52-year-old former labor union leader, has also promised a range of reforms, including the government paying all of a patients\u0027 costs for cancer treatment and a reduction of tax breaks for landlords.Morrison, a 51-year-old former tourism marketer, said he had closed Labor\u0027s lead in opinion polls during the five-week campaign and predicted a close result.Morrison promises lower taxes and better economic management than Labor.Both major parties are promising that whoever wins the election will remain prime minister until he next faces the voters\u0027 judgment. The parties have changed their rules to make the process of lawmakers replacing a prime minister more difficult.During Labor\u0027s last six years in office, the party replaced Prime Minister Kevin Rudd with his deputy Julia Gillard, then dumped her for Rudd.US spy challenge offers $250k to those who can accurately forecast future eventsLady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston\u0026#39s royal wedding: couple share a kiss after marrying in St George\u0026#39s ChapelComment: Tories and Labour are despised over Brexit – but there is a path out of this democratic crisisPrince Harry leaves Meghan at home with baby Archie as he attends Lady Gabriella Windsor\u0026#39s wedding to Tom KingstonAustria coalition in chaos as far-Right vice chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache forced to resign over Russian oligarch claimsEuropean elections latest polls: Brexit Party forecast to win most votesOn the Brexit Party campaign trail with Nigel FarageThe Brexit Party: What do they stand for, and who are the MEP candidates running for election? European elections 2019: Full list of MEP candidates How to vote for your MEP in the European electionsEuropean elections 2019: What date does the UK vote - and why are we even taking part?Lady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston\u0026#39s wedding: who are the royal couple getting married in Windsor today?Comment: It\u0026#39s not too late for the Conservative Party to bounce back Comment: Steve Baker is the determined, principled leader we need in these troubled timesComment: Lights, camera, action.

These include Hear Me Well, which turns the iPhone into a hearing aid device.Students currently at the Academy talk about how they regard it as “a perfect educational environment to develop an insatiable thirst and curiosity for development” or that it “gives you a toolbox to take your idea and turn it into reality”.iPhone owners can sue Apple over its apps, US Supreme Court decidesThe academy is part of Apple’s commitment to making coding accessible to everyone. Apple’s connection to the Malala Fund has also been a way that the company has helped spread education, including coding, to girls around the world. Apple is committed to reaching 100,000 girls worldwide through coding. The academy news came on the same day as Apple announced a partnership with Simplon in Paris.Simplon is a social enterprise in France focused on communities that would otherwise find it difficult to access training - and the training is offered at no charge.\u0026nbspSimplon has a network of organisations in France and elsewhere, which has trained more than 2,000 trainees in the digital sector since 2013. The collaboration is to teach Swift, Apple’s coding language, with a new focus on refugee and displaced young women, and women from underserved communities.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The system was first developed by Indian mathematicians before spreading through the Arab world to Europe and becoming popularised around the globe.A survey by Civic Science, an American market research company, asked 3,624 respondents: “Should schools in America teach Arabic numerals as part of their curriculum?” The poll did not explain what the term “Arabic numerals”\u0026nbspmeant.Some 2,020 people answered “no”. Twenty-nine per cent of respondents said the numerals should be taught in US schools, and 15 per cent had no opinion.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Taiwan became first state in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.

This was despite there being no significant difference in education between the two groups.He said the goal of the research was to “tease out prejudice among those who didn’t understand the question”.This bias was not limited to conservative respondents and attitudes towards Islam.Another poll question was worded: “Should schools in America teach the creation theory of Catholic priest George Lemaitre as part of their science curriculum?”Biden warns Trump is ‘giving license to prejudice’Seventy-three per cent of Democrats answered “no”, while 33 per cent of Republicans said “yes” – with many respondents on either side presumably assuming Lemaitre’s theory was related to intelligence design.In fact, the Belgian\u0026nbsppriest was also a physicist who first discovered\u0026nbspthe universe was expanding\u0026nbspand proposed its origins lay in the explosion of a single particle -\u0026nbspan idea that became known as the\u0026nbspBig Bang theory.“While Lemaitre is more obscure than Arabic numerals, the resulting effect is almost identical,” Mr Dick said. “Dems are biased against Western religion, if latently.“This kind of blind prejudice can happen on both sides.”Civic Science\u0027s research is reminiscent of a 2015 survey that found 30 per cent of Republicans supported bombing Agrabah, the fictional city where Disney\u0027s Aladdin\u0026nbspis set.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Deliveroo has issues when it comes to relations with its workforce, and Amazon isn\u0027t likely to be able to help much with themClick to followThe IndependentDeliveroo has secured a big investment but will that benefit its deliverers? There’s no more tasty a dish than the millions of dollars in Amazon cash Deliveroo is set to chow down on.\u0026nbspThe US tech kingpin is the lead investor in the\u0026nbspLondon based food delivery firm’s latest cash call, which raised $575m (£450m) in total.\u0026nbspBad news for Uber. It has obviously had its\u0026nbspattention\u0026nbspon other things of late, such as a New York Flotation and the indigestion caused to investors by the lacklustre after market for its shares.\u0026nbspEU introduces new minimum rights for ‘gig economy’ workersBut Uber Eats remains an important part of its attempt to expand beyond its ride sharing app. It even reportedly looked at buying Deliveroo.\u0026nbspThe would be Amazon of transport now has to contend with the real Amazon backing a major rival in that space.\u0026nbspAmazon had a crack at the business itself, only to retreat. That isn’t unusual. The same thing happened with its attempt to break into ticket sales, for example.\u0026nbspIt’s a restless experimenter, something that plays a key role in its success. This\u0026nbspmeans\u0026nbspaccepting that they’re not all going to work and being willing to\u0026nbspmove on when they don’t.\u0026nbspThe interesting thing here is that Amazon is not moving on. It’s a case of if you can’t beat ‘em, buy in. The investment gives it a seat at the table and a chance to see what works and what doesn’t with a company that’s succeeding with a business it was interested in but couldn’t make fly.“We’re excited to see what they do next,” said Amazon’s UK country manager Doug Gurr. And we’re just as excited to see what we can learn through watching the development of out new best pals’\u0026nbsp“innovative technology and service”.\u0026nbspAmazon has also reportedly looked at buying Deliveroo outright and if\u0026nbspfounder Will Shu does come to see a sale rather than a flotation as the end game, it would now surely be in the box seat.\u0026nbspIn the meantime Shu benefits from having the big dog in his corner and at the end of a phone line if he needs it. The market is taking that very seriously, with shares in rivals such as Just Eat falling sharply in response to the news.\u0026nbspThe biggest challenge for Deliveroo, which has raised $1.5bn to date, is the same as that facing Uber, Lyft, and many of the other current generation of tech stars. It has to find a way of sustainably turning a profit.\u0026nbspAmazon has an excellent handle on how to prove the doubters wrong when it comes to moving from a loss making investment phase to making handsome profit. In the meantime, it will be more relaxed about Deliveroo’s losses than almost any other investor, more willing to give it the leeway to be aggressive. This helps to explain why rivals shuddered.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

I must have spent a small fortune in his Richer Sounds hi-fi shops down the years, and, in a true test, I do not begrudge him a single penny. What I’ve bought has always worked, seemingly been the best I could afford at my price range, and the staff have always been helpful and knowledgeable. And his stores open at hours I can, and want, to visit.\u0026nbspYou don’t feel ripped off either. Richer Sounds specialises in offering discounts from reputable brands, some of them high-end. So, there’s little glitz, no fripperies attached. Richer’s outlets are practical, down-to-earth, and because of that, genuine.\u0026nbspBefore the editor screams “stop”, and questions how much Richer is paying for this piece of advertorial, I will end there. You get the picture.\u0026nbspRicher does things differently. His first branch was on London Bridge. That may sound glamorous, but to those who don’t know London’s retail scene that well, it isn’t. Bond Street it is not.Richer Sounds owner hands over control of hi-fi retailer to staffWhat drove him was footfall. He saw – by the way he was aged just 19 at the time – just how many people went in and out of London Bridge station during the day, and the result is a store right by the terminus entrance, next to all the snack bars, that has been regularly cited by Guinness Book of Records as possessing the highest sales per square feet of any shop in the world.Constantly, there is method in his madness. His creed, espoused in his book The Richer Way – a case for required reading on all business and management courses if ever there was one – relates, among other measures, how he rewards staff with holidays in homes owned by the company. The company-owned aspect is vital, enhancing the feeling of collectiveness, allowing them to share experiences, giving them a selection to choose from, and fostering chat and excitement during the year. It’s clever.\u0026nbspLikewise, he does not believe in zero hours. His workers are part of the business, and treated as such.\u0026nbspNow, Richer has gone a step, or rather a leap, further. He’s switching his company into one that is owned by the staff, putting 60 per cent\u0026nbspof his shares into a trust held for the employees. There’s more: each of the current 531 workers will receive a cash bonus of £1,000 for each year they’ve been with the firm. That calculates to an average payment of £8,000 per employee. Many chains would be proud of the eight-year figure, given the churn of staff in retail. But Richer has 39 staff who will collect more than £20,000 each.\u0026nbspThe scheme that he, and presumably his advisers, have devised, is smart. Richer Sounds, which has annual sales of £200m, will pay the founder £9.2m for his shares. He will then give £3.5m worth back to the staff to be owned in trust for them. He will not be paying capital gains tax on the sale of his shares, because this move qualifies for tax breaks as part of the government’s attempt to boost employee share ownership. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It’s a measure of the relatively slow progress to date that Richer’s transfer will make Richer Sounds one of the biggest employee-owned companies in the country. Out in front, by some margin, is of course\u0026nbspJohn Lewis.\u0026nbspBut the department store group went down that route as far back as 1929. It was not until the coalition government, in 2014, incentivised employee ownership that the push towards this form of mutuality received the required fillip. Owners who sell at least 51 per cent of the equity of the business to the employee-owned trust are exempt from capital gains tax. Staff receiving bonus payments paid via their trust can receive £3,600 a year in payouts tax free.There are signs, finally, of the model gaining traction. Some decent-sized names now populate the sector: Arup, Tiptree jams, Mott MacDonald, and Aardman, those folk behind Wallace \u0026amp Gromit. In all, there are now 350 companies either owned by their workers directly or via a trust, with another 50 said to be considering the shift.\u0026nbspJulian Richer has shown us how to save capitalismPoliticians don’t do enough to improve ownership rights for workersThey may be many in number, but they still lag in scale. Even so, the employee-owned band is thought to account for 5 per cent of GDP.\u0026nbspTax advantages apart, what the option also often provides is a solution to the thorny question of succession. You’re the owner if you have them, your children are not interested you could sell to an outsider, but they would almost certainly tear your life’s work apart, firing those staff who have become firm friends down the years, in the process. You’re not too bothered about the money you’ve made a fair amount, and you can only spend so much. Suddenly, handing over the firm to those loyal workers who have been with you through the bad times as well as good, who have witnessed heartbreak as well as triumph, and who devoted themselves to making the business as good as it is, has real appeal.\u0026nbspIt’s not plain sailing, though. When the company is bouncing, everyone is happy. But when things turn, the mood can quickly become sour. These are not mere employees any more but owner-employees, or as John Lewis insists on calling them,\u0026nbsp“partners”. Anyone doubting what it must be like for the John Lewis senior team only has to glance at the letters page of The Gazette, the weekly partnership magazine. The 83,000 staff, now facing vastly reduced annual bonuses, do not hold back when it come to criticising their leadership, openly questioning the direction the group is taking.\u0026nbspFortunately, given the health of the brand, the Richer hierarchy is unlikely to encounter any opposition, not in the short term anyway. The Richer deal is one in which everyone emerges richer – and I’ve not got to write that very often.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What really spooked the City, however, was a sharp rise in its debt.

Demand for winter sun was down in the Nordic region, for example. Hotel and fuel costs have been rising at a time when it has had to resort to promotional activity to tempt customers.\u0026nbspNavigating such choppy waters would be difficult for any company. Cook is trying to it with the dead weight of that debt pile attached to its keel.\u0026nbspNo wonder shareholders have been jumping for the lifeboats.

As well as selling pies – a record 800 on the day of the Premier League final – Homebaked has a sister organisation: a community land trust to own buildings for the good of residents. With ownership, locals can no long be subject to the whims of government plans such as\u0026nbsphousing market renewal, which left so many surrounding properties empty.\u0026nbspFrance’s unique approach to regenerating inner citiesRegeneration is not a dirty wordTheir success has fed into a network of other like-minded businesses in Liverpool, including Kitty’s Laundrette, which has just opened its doors down the road, and Squash, a food shop and cafe in Toxteth, or Liverpool 8, in the south of the city. “Community businesses in Liverpool are transforming the city,” says\u0026nbspVidhya\u0026nbspAlakeson, chief executive of Power to Change,\u0026nbspa lottery-funded organisation that supports the sector. “The social history of Liverpool shows a tradition of solidarity and self-reliance over many years, and now that is finding a voice through the community business movement.”Erika Rushton is\u0026nbspthe chair of Baltic Creative, which owns and manages more than 100 sq\u0026nbspft of workspace in the city’s\u0026nbspBaltic Triangle district – now home to more than 600 companies, employing 3,000 people. Baltic Creative is a community interest company, which means half of its annual £400,000 surplus is invested in buying up more property to turn into workspaces, and the other half goes towards events and improvements to the surrounding area.\u0026nbsp“Liverpool is a city that has got its confidence back,” Rushton says. “Over a 30-year period, Liverpool was told that its salvation would be an inward investor or a grant from the government. The unspoken message was you’re not capable of this, we’re going to have to do it for you. We have worked to say, that’s not true, we are the economy, it’s not something that is done to us.”In total, 84 community businesses operate in the city, defined as businesses that trade for the benefit of their communities, according to Power to Change.\u0026nbspIn May, many opened their doors for community business weekend, an annual celebration of the UK’s 7,800\u0026nbspcommunity business, which contributes £1bn to the economy, Power to Change estimates.\u0026nbspPover and Delia McMullen, volunteers at Homebaked\u0026nbspbakery in North Liverpool (Hazel Sheffield)A couple of doors down from Homebaked bakery, Catherine Simmons, a project coordinator at the land trust, happens to be looking out the window of one of the empty houses when Klopp walks past. “Is that…?” she asks in disbelief. Early on, the bakery established the way it wanted to do business with Liverpool FC. It did not take grants, but instead signed a contract for the club to sell its pies in the VIP lounge. The relationship has set the tone for the way that the bakery, the land trust and other community enterprises deal with big business: as equal trading partners.When Simmons first took on her role at the land trust, she was occupied with finishing the renovation of the flats above the bakery. Now the flats have been filled with tenants, Simmons has turned her attention to the rest of houses on the row. In April, they applied for planning permission to bring the nine properties back to use. The idea was to create a blueprint for a modern high street, drawn from workshops and interviews with residents about the kinds of shops they wanted to see.Architects Urbed have drawn up plans that show the fronts of houses preserved\u0026nbsp– an important feature for residents who said they were tired of too much change – but the insides transformed into eight affordable residential units and up to four retail spaces. Urbed have designed the building to the highest environmental standards, to reduce energy bills that add to the financial pressure on lower-income residents. The initiative is being funded by Power to Change and the Homes England Community Housing Fund.\u0026nbspA couple of streets away, Kitty’s Laundrette is getting ready for its opening party. A local cinema group called Cinema Nation is putting on an archive film night themed around rebellious women – a good fit for a laundry named after Kitty Wilkinson, who let women with infected linens use her boiler during the cholera epidemic, and was instrumental in the movement to open the UK’s first public washhouse.\u0026nbspGrace Harrison, a project coordinator at Kitty’s, says that their business has been supported by a network of like-minded enterprises\u0026nbspwithin the sector. “We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Homebaked,” she says. At that moment a delivery of 200 beers arrives – a gift from local Love Lane brewery for the opening party at the weekend.\u0026nbspWhile Power to Change and other third sector organisations have supported Kitty’s financially, they are appealing for local residents and businesses to buy their services and make the business sustainable: “You can generate a lot of goodwill in your area, but we need people to buy with us if we want to invest locally. Community business is about learning from the third sector, but also about autonomy from income generation,” Harrison says.In south Liverpool, Squash will start the weekend’s celebrations with a street party hosted by 14 organisations on Windsor Street. Clare Owens, a co-director of Squash, says the\u0026nbspparty is an important moment for like-minded enterprises to come together and celebrate. “Running a community business is really rewarding but it can be hard work!” she says.Squash has coordinated food projects and growing spaces in the south of Liverpool for more than a decade. In 2018, it chose community business weekend to open the doors on a space designed by local people on Windsor Street, with high ceilings, natural light and meeting spaces for groups.\u0026nbspAs well as making its own sourdough, Squash sells a range of products including organic fruit and vegetables, Homebaked bread, and ingredients to get people cooking, rather than shopping for mass-produced food. Squash, like many businesses in the sector, is aiming for sustainability over profit. Owens sees this as an advantage. “We have a hundred-year street project –\u0026nbspimagine\u0026nbspfood growing on our street over a long period of time,” she says. “It’s a slow, growing project that everyone can access at their own pace. By working together and being resilient in this way, you can effect social change.”Community businesses open their doors around the UKRachael O’Byrne, community engagement lead at Kitty’s, says that changing the narrative in neighbourhoods that have suffered\u0026nbsplong-term lack of investment takes time. “It might seem like this is happening all of a sudden but in reality it has been decades in the making,” she says. “People have lived and died in this community waiting for a grand regeneration that never arrived.”But as the sector grows, collaboration between these businesses is making them increasingly resilient to challenges – and optimistic about the future. “There are so many businesses across Liverpool that are community-minded. We are forming this supportive network that means other new businesses can come to us for advice,” O’Byrne\u0026nbspsays. “It’s creating\u0026nbspa ripple effect.”power to changeOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Charges can also be levied for making alterations to a property. A significant number of leaseholders say they have been hit with unjustifiable rises to the ground rent or unfair charges for making minor cosmetic changes such as changing a doorbell.In the most extreme cases, fees have been so high properties become difficult to sell.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingThe HCLG\u0026nbspcommittee is concerned that some leaseholds have been quickly sold on to third parties who then vastly increase the cost.Committee chair\u0026nbspClive Betts said: “We heard extensive evidence from leaseholders regarding onerous ground rent terms, high and opaque service charges and one-off bills, unfair and excessive permission charges, and unreasonable costs to enfranchise or extend leases.“Over the course of the inquiry we heard evidence suggesting that there are a significant number of cases where home buyers may have been deliberately misled about the terms they were signing up to.“If the sale of leasehold house has taken place with the home buyer under the impression that they were buying it freehold, or ‘equivalent to freehold’ as many were told, then action needs to be taken.“Equally, if a home buyer is told they will be able to buy the freehold in a couple of years, only to find out it has been sold on to another company, then this should be investigated.”He continued: “Home buyers need to be protected and, where evidence of mis-selling is proved, it is right that the CMA take action.”A CMA spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “The select committee has raised serious concerns that many homeowners who buy long leasehold property don’t know exactly what they are signing up to, and may be trapped in contracts with unfair terms once they move in.“We have committed to investigating whether these homeowners are being hit with expensive fees or unfair contract terms, as well as being given all the information they need before signing on the dotted line. We will set out the full terms of this work when it begins.”More than 40 property developers and freeholders have signed up to a pledge launched by communities secretary James Brokenshire to prevent leaseholders being trapped in costly deals.Mr Brokenshire said: “For too long, exploitative and unfair leasehold arrangements have placed excessive burdens on homeowners.“These have no place in a modern housing market and since becoming communities secretary I have repeatedly made clear my ambition to end them.“That’s why I asked the Competition and Markets Authority to look into the issue and I am pleased to see it is now taking action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Charges can also be levied for making alterations to a property. A significant number of leaseholders say they have been hit with unjustifiable rises to the ground rent or unfair charges for making minor cosmetic changes such as changing a doorbell.In the most extreme cases, fees have been so high properties become difficult to sell.Half of leasehold house owners didn’t know what they were buyingThe HCLG\u0026nbspcommittee is concerned that some leaseholds have been quickly sold on to third parties who then vastly increase the cost.Committee chair\u0026nbspClive Betts said: “We heard extensive evidence from leaseholders regarding onerous ground rent terms, high and opaque service charges and one-off bills, unfair and excessive permission charges, and unreasonable costs to enfranchise or extend leases.“Over the course of the inquiry we heard evidence suggesting that there are a significant number of cases where home buyers may have been deliberately misled about the terms they were signing up to.“If the sale of leasehold house has taken place with the home buyer under the impression that they were buying it freehold, or ‘equivalent to freehold’ as many were told, then action needs to be taken.“Equally, if a home buyer is told they will be able to buy the freehold in a couple of years, only to find out it has been sold on to another company, then this should be investigated.”He continued: “Home buyers need to be protected and, where evidence of mis-selling is proved, it is right that the CMA take action.”A CMA spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “The select committee has raised serious concerns that many homeowners who buy long leasehold property don’t know exactly what they are signing up to, and may be trapped in contracts with unfair terms once they move in.“We have committed to investigating whether these homeowners are being hit with expensive fees or unfair contract terms, as well as being given all the information they need before signing on the dotted line. We will set out the full terms of this work when it begins.”More than 40 property developers and freeholders have signed up to a pledge launched by communities secretary James Brokenshire to prevent leaseholders being trapped in costly deals.Mr Brokenshire said: “For too long, exploitative and unfair leasehold arrangements have placed excessive burdens on homeowners.“These have no place in a modern housing market and since becoming communities secretary I have repeatedly made clear my ambition to end them.“That’s why I asked the Competition and Markets Authority to look into the issue and I am pleased to see it is now taking action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those in attendance\u0026nbspon the French Riviera gave the film\u0026nbspa standing ovation, yet the reviews have been lukewarm.\u0026nbspDirected by Dexter Fletcher and starring Taron Egerton, Rocketman has been called a fantastical account of the “Tiny Dancer” singer’s life,\u0026nbsprather than a warts-and-all telling.Many critics compared the film to\u0026nbspQueen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, which was worked on by Dexter Fletcher, who took over as director from Brian Singer midway through production. Bohemian Rhapsody defied middling reviews to gross upwards of\u0026nbsp£705 million at the global box office.The Independent‘s\u0026nbspGeoffrey Macnab\u0026nbspsaid Fletcher “uses lavish musical sequences to whisk his way through episodes in Elton John’s life”. Macnab describes the film as ing into some of Elton’s darkest moments, but that\u0026nbspthese are filmed in a\u0026nbsp”very flamboyant fashion” that\u0026nbsp”manages to leaven matters with some ironic humour”.Created with Sketch.

This weekend\u0027s Full Flower Blue Moon is even rarer still, happening only every dozen or so blue moons.But despite what its name suggests, this full moon will not actually by blue. The name simply refers to the fact that it is the fourth full moon of the season, when typically there are only three full moons in a season.In 2019 there has already been a Blood Moon, a Pink Moon and a Super Worm Moon –\u0026nbspeach named after various occurrences that take place at the time of year the full moon appears.The Flower Moon, which is set to rise at dusk on Saturday 18 May, is appropriately named after the the flowers that bloom in the month of May.The next Blue Moon won\u0027t occur again until 2021, so astronomers will be hoping for clear skies this weekend.Created with Sketch.Super worm moon - last supermoon of 2019 in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Worm moon rises over the Karancs Hills in HungaryWorm moon over the Empire State Building in New YorkWorm moon rises over the Galicia Massif mountains in SpainWorm moon rises over the Santiago de Compostela cathedral in Galicia, SpainWorm moon rises over silhouettes of the Beatles in LiverpoolWorm moon over the Guggenheim Museum in Bibao, SpainWorm moon rises over the Karancs Hills in HungaryWorm moon over the Empire State Building in New YorkWorm moon rises over the Galicia Massif mountains in SpainWorm moon rises over the Santiago de Compostela cathedral in Galicia, SpainWorm moon rises over silhouettes of the Beatles in LiverpoolWorm moon over the Guggenheim Museum in Bibao, SpainThis weekend will also see a number of other astronomical events, according to Nasa.By the morning of the full moon on 18 May \u0026nbsp2019, as morning twilight begins, Jupiter will appear in the south-southwest about 23 degrees above the horizon and Saturn will appear in the south about 30 degrees above the horizon,” the space agency said in a statement.“Venus will be rising about 7 minutes after morning twilight begins but should be visible low in the east-northeast until about 30 minutes before sunrise.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 432 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.532 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1332 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1432 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1732 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2132 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2732 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2932 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3132 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.The album was preceded by brief clips for the song’s “IGOR’S THEME”, “NEW MAGIC WAND”, “WHATSGOOD” and “a boy is a gun”.\u0026nbspThe self-confessed Call Me By Your Name fan also drops a reference to the film on “I Think”, with the line: “And I wish you would call me by your name ’cause I’m sorry.”\u0026nbspKanye West pays tribute to Nipsey Hussle at Sunday ServiceTyler the Creator praises musician for comedy breakdown of his musicTyler previously referenced CMBYN star Timothée Chalamet on his single “OKRA”.He shared a disclaimer on his social media before the album’s release: “Don’t go into this expecting a rap album,” he said. “Don’t go into this expecting any album.”Early fan reactions to the record have been largely positive on social media. It is available to download and stream on all major platforms including iTunes and Spotify.\u0026nbspTyler the CreatorThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She cited\u0026nbsplyrics from his first\u0026nbspmixtape, Bastard,\u0026nbspreleased in 2009, as the reason for the ban.“Coming to the UK is a privilege,” a\u0026nbspletter from the government said at the time, “and we expect those who come here to respect our shared values”.The ban – which led to Tyler cancelling a show at Reading and Leeds festival – was\u0026nbspreportedly\u0026nbsplifted earlier this year, on the 13\u0026nbspFebruary. It is understood that the rapper arrived at Luton Airport in the early hours of the morning (18 May).Tyler posted a picture of himself standing outside Buckingham Palace on Twitter and\u0026nbsphinted that he may be playing a secret show later in the day, with the photograph\u0027s caption reading: “LONDON IGOR 3PM WILL UPDATE YOU LATER WITH LOCATION.”The Independent has reached out to Tyler’s representatives for confirmation on whether the ban has been lifted.Tyler released his sixth album IGOR yesterday (18 May). The Independent awarded the record five stars, with our critic calling it Tyler’s “best work to date”.Created with Sketch.

Some predicted that the situation would not improve until there is a new government with a Commons\u0026nbspmajority.\u0026nbspGovernment has spent too much time on Brexit, voters sayFormer Conservative Party vice chairman Ben Bradley told The Independent: “The reason there aren’t more votes is presumably that the government isn’t confident it can win them.The Mansfield MP said he was spending more time on his role on the education select committee and doing constituency events, saying: “I’m just trying to do something useful…it’s nice having the flexibility and spending more time in the constituency but equally because nobody knows what’s going on, you get dragged down here for no reason.“I got down at 4 o\u0027clock\u0026nbspon Monday having been told we must come because there was a vote, but by 6 o’clock we were told we could go home. It’s a total waste of my time travelling and it’s a waste of the cost of the train tickets. Nobody knows what is going on. I get thousands of requests to come to village fetes and local community events and I could be going and doing more of them.Suggesting that\u0026nbspnothing would change until Ms May resigns, he added: People are very frustrated. It’s just the waiting. Everybody knows what needs to happen and it’s not happening and we haven’t got the tools to make it happen - only the cabinet and the 1922 Committee can do that.\u0026nbspWe’re all just treading water.Mr Bradley said the lack of Commons action had\u0026nbspallowed time for prospective Conservative leadership candidates to step up\u0026nbsptheir bids to succeed Theresa\u0026nbspMay.He said: “There’s a lot of plotting going on – that fills a lot of time. A lot of people are off helping the leadership campaigns or having lots of coffees with people who would like to be the new leader. But I think most people are trying to spend as little time here as possible.”Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentLabour\u0027s Chris Bryant, who is receiving treatment for skin cancer, said uncertainty over the Commons schedule had forced\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspto missing important medical appointments.He said: I\u0027ve been travelling back and forth to Wales for medical appointments but two women MPs have told me they\u0027ve put off smear tests because they\u0027re not sure they\u0027ll be able to get there because they don\u0027t know what the business will be for the next day. It\u0027s the same for other types of screening - a male MP told me he\u0027d had to miss a prostate test.Other people can\u0027t get home to put their kids to bed. I\u0027m sure it\u0027s not much fun at the moment for anybody who has got young kids.Describing\u0026nbspthe situation that\u0026nbspMPs find themselves in, he said: It\u0027s like being stuck in the middle of an ocean in the doldrums waiting for a breeze, not even\u0026nbspbothering to mount a mutiny because if you pushed them into a boat, they\u0027d just sit there for another four weeks...It\u0027s a very strange parliament.He added: It\u0027s completely unprecedented. Half the time the government benches are empty and we\u0027re busying ourselves on our side but the one thing we can\u0027t do is introduce legislation or pass spending plans...It\u0027s a phantom government.Liberal Democrat\u0026nbspMP Sir Ed Davey said the inaction in parliament was giving him more time to focus on constituency work and campaigns, but criticised the government for an appalling lack of activity.He said: If you\u0027re a\u0026nbspfastidious MP there\u0027s so much\u0026nbspyou can do regardless of what the government is doing, mostly in the constituency. I have a lot of advice and casework so when parliament isn\u0027t busy, I\u0027m always doing work in the constituency. If\u0026nbspanyone is twiddling their thumbs, they\u0027re not doing the job properly...Parliament doesn\u0027t\u0026nbsphave to be sitting and active for MPs to be involved in important politics things.That said, this\u0026nbspgovernment is\u0026nbspthe most incompetent, inefficient, ineffective\u0026nbspgovernment I have ever known. For parliament not to be addressing key issues, whether it is\u0026nbspclimate change or\u0026nbspschool budget cuts or rising crime - the government doesn\u0027t really seem as engaged as it could be....The lack of decision-making and the lack of urgency is appalling.He added: The\u0026nbspgovernment is incapable of using its power to address the issues of the country...It\u0027s totally unprecedented.\u0026nbspI don\u0027t think there\u0027s been a time like this.Independent MP Frank Field, who chairs the Commons work and pension committee, said he had urged Ms May\u0026nbspto prioritise bills from backbenchers and select committees in order to give MPs something to debate.He said: Aside from the occasional skirmish on Brexit, parliament has had very little to do in recent months.“In an attempt to fill the domestic reform vacuum, I submitted a proposal to the prime minister for the government to give the necessary time and protection to bills presented by backbenchers, as well as select committees, that are approved by the cabinet’s legislative committee. Had this approach been picked up, we could have had a major domestic reform programme without waiting for Brexit.”Created with Sketch.The front pages on what would have been Brexit Day Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.March 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about BrexitMarch 29 2019 - The original date for Britain\u0027s departure from the EU, what do the newspapers have to say about it?The  focuses on the fact that today was the original day for Britain\u0027s departure from the EUThe Daily Mail warns MPs that they have one last chance to back the Prime Minister\u0027s Brexit dealThe Independent Daily Edition reports that the Prime Minister is gambling as she holds a vote today on the withdrawal agreementThe Sun reports that the Prime Minister last night sought to convince DUP leader Arlene Foster to back her deal reports that some ministers want the Prime Minister to step down now, while Michael Gove becomes the favourite at the bookies to replace herThe i reports that Boris Johnson is preparing his leadership bid for when the Prime Minister resignsThe Times reports that Brexit may be delayed for a further yearThe Daily  reports that the Prime Minister is making a desperate final plea to pass her Brexit deal through the house of commonsThe Financial Times reports on the Brexit Betrayal march that will reach London today after setting off from Sunderland with the intention of reaching London on Brexit dayThe Daily Mirror reports on the Prime Minister\u0027s difficulty passing her deal through the commonsThe Daily Star calls on its readers to shut up about BrexitExperts said the lack of a legislative programme was usually a sign of a government coming towards the end of its term – and of an imminent general election.Alice Lilly, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government, said: “The government is bringing forward legislation but it’s very limited – it\u0027s bills on issues such as circus animals or a lease for Kew Gardens.“We’re still in the first session of a new parliament so you’d expect the government to be bringing forward very wide-ranging or significant bills, but beyond Brexit we’re absolutely not seeing that at the moment.She added: “It looks like a government in the final session of a parliament, where essentially they are doing little bits and pieces waiting for an election. It’s not what you would be expecting in the first session…Essentially they are filling time.”The lack of attention given to issues beyond Brexit has also been noticed by the public.A poll for\u0026nbspThe Independent found that almost three-quarters of voters believe the government has focused too much on Brexit\u0026nbspat the expense of other matters.The BMG survey found that 74 per cent of people\u0026nbspsaid ministers had “forgotten” about important domestic issues.Institute for GovernmentThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A general election before that not only risks Jeremy Corbyn, but it risks killing Brexit altogether.We\u0027ve got to deliver Brexit in this parliament, then we can move forward.The health secretary\u0027s comments also came as Ms May faced growing clamour from within her own party to step down immediately in the aftermath of the collapse in talks between the government and the Labour Party.Mr Corbyn dramatically pulled the plug on cross-party talks after more than six weeks, saying they had “gone as far as they can” and the parties had been “unable to bridge important policy gaps”.\u0026nbspMay faces calls to quit now after collapse of cross-party Brexit talksCBI demands MPs cancel spring break to resolve Brexit crisisLib Dems overtake Labour in the polls for Euro electionsIt is unsurprising that the cross-party Brexit talks have collapsedMay blames Labour isions over referendum for end of Brexit talksEarlier this week Ms May bowed to pressure to agree a timetable at the start of next month for a Conservative leadership contest if she – as many in Westminster expect – loses a critical vote on her Brexit legislation.But after the breakdown in the negotiations, the former minister David Jones said the PM should recognise that “now is the time that she should stand down”“On the Conservative benches, most people now want the PM to step down as quickly as possible,”\u0026nbsphe told The Independent. “Prolonging this is just wasting time at a time when we don’t have much time to waste.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot then tried to get him via video link from jail, but he again refused to participate.In , when -year-old Toronto woman Rehab Dughmosh refused to appear in court on terror-related charges, even liberal old Canada issued an “extremely rare” legal order for the wonderfully phrased “cell extraction”.Five officers were given the authority to,necessary, restrain and drag her to court by the scruff of her neck even , as one court official put it: “It may require shackles on the hands and feet.”Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.So, did -year-old McCann, from Aylesbury, Bucks, get the same treatment  Dream on. Instead, the judge, court clerk and prosecution and defence teams were all forced to up sticks and travel  miles to the prison with, don’t laugh, the official court crest in an Argos carrier bag.There, the judge visited McCann in the healthcare wing, where he refused to confirm his name, wouldn’t stand and, at one point, reportedly turned his back to the impromptu hearing before stating he had “been stitched up”.And it seems he’s not alone in this disgraceful behaviour that’s being indulged by our pathetically weak “justice” system.Last year, Gloucester’s top judge, Jamie Tabor QC, said it has now “become fashionable for defendants to refuse to come to court”, noting that the worrying trend started around two years earlier.Yet as far back as , convicted drug dealer Amir Ali refused to attend a confiscation hearing at Lewes Crown Court in East Sussex because he feared losing his cell to another inmate while he was away and claimed it was a breach of his human rights.At the time, Judge Richard Hayward lashed out at the “barking mad” rules stemming from the  Human Rights Act. He added: “I didn’t know that prisoners could choose whether or not to come to court. I just assumed they would be scooped up by a burly prison warden and dumped in the back of a van.” So did we, Judge. So did we.Yet here we are,  years later, still allowing the human rights of an alleged criminal to run roughshod over the court’s authority.IT’S rumoured that -year-old Grace Jones may be filming a scene with Daniel Craig for the upcoming th Bond movie. Cue much excitement about unleashing the power of the older woman, yada yada.Bring it on. But let’s hope Ms Jones’ character fares better than the last time an “older actress” was announced, amid much fanfare, for the movie Spectre.It was -year-old Monica Bellucciand the scene involved her being groped up against a wall by Daniel Craig, who then left her languishing in a basque and stockings while he went off and fell in love with someone younger.The earth may well have moved for Monica’s character, but ground-breaking it was not.MADELEINE McCANN would have been  on Sunday. Sweet . The age when girls start to blossom into young women, steal our make-up and clothes, have myriad crushes and secrets we might never find out about.Instead, her parents Kate and Gerry have passed another torturous year of not knowing whether she’s dead or alive.Wishing their daughter a happy birthday on their Find Maddie Facebook page, they added: “We love you and we’re waiting for you and we’re never going to give up.”Spending a quiet day at home with their other two children, they reportedly placed presents in Maddie’s room and blew out the candles on a commemorative cake.To not celebrate would perhaps feel like an abandonment of hope. My heart goes out to them and all the other parents of missing children. What they’ve been through – and continue to endure – is unimaginable.THE first rule of “modern friendship”, apparently, is never failing to “like” or comment on a pal’s social media posts.PRINCE CHARLES is advertising for a gardener to tend the herbaceous borders of his house on Scotland’s vast Balmoral Estate.Their skill set should include a love of the outdoors, green fingers and, presumably, the ability to e out of harm’s way should Prince Philip ever choose to drive over for a visit.A GP surgery in Cambridgeshire has hired staff who speak a record  languages to cope with patients born abroad.GENTLEMAN JACK actress Suranne Jones reveals that producers brought in an “intimacy director” to make sure the TV show’s sex scenes “do right by the lesbian community”.Nice workyou can get it.

They’re wearing a fake bump.We already have to tolerate those ads for disability aids that feature a thirtysomething with the agility of a mountain goat simply because companies clearly feel that showing hair loss, wrinkles and bunions is a little too much reality.Now we’re being flogged the illusion thatwe buy certain maternity clothes, we too might swerve the plight of swollen ankles and Popeye arms.Fat chance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And yet the zoo did nothing until receiving international criticism. Under their care, this baby elephant broke both of his back legs, and the zoo did not even realise for three days.I can’t bring myself to imagine Dumbo’s suffering during this time.”“For Dumbo to die whilst under the so-called care and treatment of the zoo shows just how neglected these animals are in captivity.”The baby elephant broke its back legs when its front legs became stuck in a puddle of mud.He was attempting to hold himself up with just his back legs on dry ground, but both legs were so weak that they snapped.Phuket Zoo, which housed the animal, is free to acquire another baby elephantthey choose to do so.Dumbo was obviously ill in the footage that went viral last month.After he was hospitalised, a vet revealed that he had had an infection in his digestive tract for months.He told local newspapers: “He had an infection that resulted in constant diarrhoea, which caused other health complications, including the fact that his body was not absorbing nutrients as it should, which made him very weak.Moving Animals are urging tourists never to pay to see animals in captivity.Jones said: No animal deserves to repeat Dumbos tragic story.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The -year-old has a wise head on those young shoulders.She realises just how toxic s like Twitter, Instagram and Facebook can be and understands the long-term damage they cause.We are already in a very dark place when it comes to these s.This week there was the utterly heartbreaking story of a -year-old girl in Malaysia who took her own le after asking her social media followers whether or not she should do so.Appallingly,  per cent of her Instagram followers voted that she should kill herself. So she did.This young woman, with everything to live for, jumped off a high building in Sarawak, Borneo, and her le was snuffed out. Apparently the poor kid, who has not been named, had a history of depression and was clearly seeking some sort of help or validation via social media.Instead, some seriously sick and callous people encouraged her to die.This is the kind of appalling tragedy Selena is concerned about. She wants people to be more supportive of one another online and to spread kindness instead of cruelty and hatred.Selena has had a tough time of her own battling mental health problems after being struck down by lupus, a disease that attacks the immune system and which forced her to undergo a kidney transplant.She took a long break from Instagram and is now extremely careful about what she posts.Selena has spoken eloquently about the young fans she meets who talk to her about being bullied online and feeling powerless to defend themselves.I am so glad I grew up in a time before my mistakes would be posted for all to see on the internet.I would have been slaughtered on Twitter for my awkward early TV appearances.Instead, I was allowed to learn and improve without being made to feel like a failure.I have recently abandoned Twitter, as it had become exhaustingly toxic.I mostly use Instagram to post funny pictures of my beloved Border Terrier Angus, or details of my outfits on TV, simply because I get so many people asking which shop they come from.I occasionally receive some pretty horrid comments about my sense of style but I try to ignore them and not to be too hurt.This week I spoke to Leigh-Anne Pinnock of Little Mix.All four young women in the group have been bombarded with negative comments online ever since winning The X Factor in .They are vilied for their appearance and choice of clothes — and sadly, Leigh-Anne has been subjected to disgusting racism too.It’s been so tough for her and for bandmates Jesy, Jade and Perrie, leaving them upset and shaken. It has taken years for them to stop looking at social media and be strong enough to ignore corrosive comments.I happen to think some of their outfits are a bit risque and clearly I wouldn’t wear them myself — but so what  It is their choice andthey want to be a bit naughty and raunchy, they should go for it.I heartily applaud Selena and Leigh-Anne for speaking out and trying to limit the power of hideous trolls.We can’t all be like Piers Morgan, who is bombarded with negative and abusive comments but cheerfully retweets them, correcting the spelling and grammar of even the most appalling insults.We are not all so thick-skinned and, as Selena has pointed out, it’s too late to police social media effectively.Sadly it gives the sickest, most twisted and cruellest people a chance to inflict suffering and mental anguish on the rest of us.The message is simple: Be like Selina and Leigh-Anne. Ignore the trolls, don’t feed them — andyou feel you can’t live without social media, try to be positive and uplting.IF you are in need of an injection of sheer joy and happiness, download the  movie musical Calamity Jane and prepare to be enchanted by a le- affirming performance from the late, great Doris Day.At a time in Hollywood when women were either sex symbols or old maids, Doris gave an ass-kicking lead performance to make us laugh and cry, often in the same scene.Doris, who died this week aged , was a triple threat who could act, sing and dance to perfection. She moved with the greatest of ease from musical dramas like Love Me Or Leave Me and Young At Heart to the frothy comedies Pillow Talk and Move Over Darling.A class act who never felt the need to hang on to the spotlight, she was happy as a clam living in Carmel, Calornia, with her beloved pets, raising money to care for neglected animals.Doris will be sadly missed but what a legacy she leaves behind.GREAT to see top actor Stephen Graham finally getting the attention and praise he so richly deserves.He played a blinder in BBC’s Line Of Duty as a tortured undercover cop and is now burning up the screen in The Virtues on Channel  as a broken alcoholic.It’s an acting masterclass, completely believable and utterly authentic.Last weekend, Jodie Comer made a point of praising Stephen during her acceptance speech for the best actress gong at the Baftas.Jodie won for her mesmerising performance as assassin Villanelle in Killing Eve and was quick to say she owes Stephen a pint for all his support when she started acting.So not only an incredible performer but a kind-hearted and generous one too.We will see him on our screens later this year alongside the star of the new Warburtons adverts, Robert De Niro, as well as Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, in Netflix movie The Irishman, directed by Martin Scorsese.I guarantee Stephen will steal every scene he appears in. This is his golden time and no one deserves it more.ABORTION features currently on two of our TV dramas. In Emmerdale, Victoria Barton has been raped and is now pregnant.And in Holby City, it has been revealed that surgeon Ange was raped as a young woman and decided to go ahead with the pregnancy, keeping daughter Chloe.Both fictional characters have the right to choose what to do with their own bodies – something I firmly believe in.Right now in America, that choice has been taken away from real women living in the very conservative state of Alabama, where abortion has been banned altogether.This means a child, young girl or woman who is raped and discovers she is pregnant will have to go through with the birth.Evenshe is the victim of incest and repeatedly raped by a family member – father, brother or uncle – and is impregnated, she will not be able to have a termination.This is hideous, inhumane and deeply disturbing, especially as the draconian abortion ban is likely to spread into other US states.Right here and now in Alabama, doctors who perform abortions could go to prison for  years and the anti-abortion movement is gaining ground.On Thursday, the Republican-led senate in Missouri passed a Bill to ban abortions, this time at eight weeks. Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio and Georgia have already approved “heartbeat” abortion bans at just six weeks, when most women wouldn’t even realise they are pregnant.Louisiana, South Carolina and Tennessee are set to follow and in other states, legislation is being drawn up to make abortion either more dficult or completely impossible.Aside from some victims of rape and incest, no woman ever goes through with an abortion without suffering horrendous grief and anguish.It’s never a decision taken lightly and we simply cannot go back to the days when pregnant women and the medics who help them are treated like criminals.The US is going backwards at an alarming rate and these laws will simply drive terminations underground, putting women at severe risk of botched backstreet abortions that can maim for le or even kill.Shame on every legislator who helped pass these cruel laws.GOOD luck to Michael Rice, who takes to the stage in Tel Aviv desperately hoping not to come last in the Eurovision Song Contest.This is no reflection on his performance or the song Bigger Than Us, which is our best effort in years.It’s down to biased voting to punish the UK for all the Brexit b*****ks.On the surface, Eurovision is a screechingly hilarious fun-filled campfest to be applauded and enjoyed.But underneath, it’s horribly political and rather grubby.We could have Adele and Robbie Williams singing a duet and still come bottom of the heap, such is the depth of anti-British feeling.Michael wasn’t born the last time the UK won Eurovision, with Love Shine A Light by Katrina  The Waves in .Times have changed since those heady days and now anything other than the dreaded “nul points” will be a victory for young Michael.He’s philosophical about his prospects and determined to enjoy sharing the same stage as Madonna in front of the biggest audience of his career.

A columnist at the left-leaning New Statesman magazine described it as curating “a morbidly chaotic picture of a British underclass — for those watching at home to scoff and sneer”.Over at the self-appointed moral compass of Britain, , an editorial complained it preyed on “vulnerable, unhappy people”, turning “a blind eye to mental health problems”. writer Zoe Williams had previously claimed: “Jeremy Kyle has created the cultural spectre of this feral underclass, none of whom has the smallest amount of emotional restraint.”Such bile aimed at a show loved by so many — the final episode, on Friday last week, drew over a million viewers — reveals as much about Kyle as who our commentariat feel has the right to speak, and how they are meant to do it.Kyle’s cull comes at a time of unprecedented openness around personal and mental health issues — as middle-class public figures are lauded for sharing their private woes.Yet working-class people airing their issues on daytime TV find themselves derided.Perhaps Kyle’s guests didn’t speak with the right accent or wear the right clothes. They didn’t have impressive jobs or double-barreled names. They did not articulate themselves calmly, via book deals, or break down on Instragram with full faces of make-up.Rather than be celebrated for bravery, they are written off as dysal.Many of Kyle’s guests did not have mental health issues — they were normal people discussing their problems. There were estranged parents, people struggling to trust or dealing with addiction.Kyle gave real people a voice. Among those who have complained about experiences on the show, many have also said it helped them.Although judgmental about his guests’ actions, Kyle did not judge his guests. Open about his own problems, he believed his guests were as capable of turning their lives around as him. This is more credit than many commentators have given them.It’s offensive to hear Kyle’s adult guests written off as “vulnerable”, asincapable of deciding whether to appear. After  years, , episodes and  series, they would have known Kyle’s style. These were adults choosing to share stories on a  that mattered to them.It comes, of course, as royalty, showbiz celebrities and broadsheet columnists have been praised for publicly airing their personal problems. Never have we celebrated sharing these issues so loudly. When Prince Harry spoke of coming close to a breakdown, singer Will Young his struggle with anxiety and model Cara Delevingne her depression, people applauded.They belong to an industry of openness. Books chronicling personal struggles with mental health are being published to acclaim. Such as Susannah Cahalan’s memoir Brain On Fire, about her psychosis. Or Matt Haig’s memoir about depression, Reasons To Stay Alive. Documentaries such as Bake Off winner Nadiya Hussain’s this week, Anxiety And Me, are praised.Sharing such issues is important. Prince Harry, on his tour of Australia, spoke thoughtfully about how people “must not silently suffer” and must share problems because others “will relish the opportunity to listen or talk themselves”. Yet apparently all this admiration for openness does not extend to Kyle’s guests.Charles Walker complained they were “emotional”. This from a man commended for speaking about his OCD, which he said made him a “practising fruitcake”.Onewriter described Kyle’s guests as “delinquent children, tearaway teens, feckless fathers, long-term unemployed . . . alcoholics, junkies, the sexually insecure, the sexually confused, the sexually poly-amorous” — but could have been describing contributors to the paper’s blog Comment Is Free.District judge Alan Berg described Kyle’s show as “human bear-baiting” and “a morbid and depressing display of dysal people who are in some kind of turmoil”.Asyou couldn’t say the same about many in the House of Commons.The bile for Kyle contrasts, too, with praise of other reality TV — in particular, Love Island. Also aired on ITV, it has seen the suicide of two of its former contestants. Yet the show is celebrated. columnist Leah Green  praised how it “makes the complexities of British society so tangible they can’t be ignored”. Another column in the paper cheered it as “a place where liars and love rats get called out and prejudices are exposed.” It opined: “There is something to be gleaned here about friendship, race . . . and the way men and women communicate.”Perhaps such lessons are just more palatable when they come via men with tanned six-packs and women with perfect teeth.When I watched Kyle’s show I didn’t see a “feral under-class”. I saw people I know. I saw real le, which is messy, dysal and chaotic, which does not always come out in well-formed sentences, memoirs or documentaries made by people with posh accents for Radio .I didn’t watch Kyle to sneer. I watched with relief that some people were truly open about the madness of le. What happens to them now Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whereas most normal people have seen no rise in their living standards for a decade, these geniuses just keep smashing their good fortune out of the park. As the annual Sunday Times Rich List shows, Britain’s , wealthiest iniduals now possess a record £.billion, up £.bn on last year, with  people now worth more than a billion. What talent, and ­dedication to your bank balance, that must take. ­Especially as we know it has nothing to do with exploiting ­governments, abusing workers and blatant tax avoidance. Among their number is Sir James Dyson, who upped his wealth by £.bn to £.bn, despite the great patriotic Brexiteer pleading that “economic forces” left him with no option but to move his company’s headquarters to Singapore. They’re also masters at justying their stratospheric growth in riches, claiming it’s good for society as it ­inevitably trickles down.Yet this week, the Charities Aid Foundation reported a noticeable drop in the number of super-rich iniduals donating more than  per cent of their wealth. It’s not just the super-rich, either. It’s the just-about-very-rich. Take Tesco boss Dave Lewis who picked up a £.million annual pay packet months after stating , jobs were at risk in “a major cost-cutting drive”.Well, there’s costs and costs isn’t there  This confirmation of how easy it is to keep getting much more loadedyou’re already loaded, comes in a week when Nobel-prize winning ­economist Sir Angus Deaton claimed Britain is on the road to becoming one of the most unequal nations on Earth.  Pointing out that CEOs of FTSE  firms are now paid  times more than their average worker , Sir Angus issued a warning. “There’s a real question about whether ­democratic capitalism is working, when it is only working for part of the population. People really feel that not everybody is having a fair crack anymore.. But all hope is not lost. We also heard this week that Julian Richer, owner of audio chain Richer Sounds, is handing control of his business to staff now that he’s hit . He is giving them  per cent of his shares and triggering windfalls for  employees, who’ll receive £, for every year they’ve worked there. Richer Sounds refuses to employ people on zero hours contracts, donates  per cent of its profits to charity, and is founded on “the ethical ­principles of being decent, honest and truthful”. And last year, Richer founded Tax Watch UK, an investigative think-tank, dedicated to the research and exposure of aggressive tax-avoiding corporations. Those FTSE billionaires no doubt scoffed at his naivety, especially as he used to be a Tory party donor. How can a chap who used to bat for them turn into a covert Marxist  How can a chap go on Radio , as Richer did this week, and say “inequality in this country is the worst I’ve known in my letime”  I sense a changing mood among some young entrepreneurs and am optimistic more may begin to see the bigger picture.That it’s not all about accumulating a wealth you can never spend and trampling your workers underfoot along the way. That there’s a better definition of success. Maybe in the midst of today’s ­corporate indecency there’s hope for the decent. "},{"url":null,"title":"summer garden watering gadget ban","story":"AdvertorialShoppers are going mad for these £ magic balls which water your plants while youre outGardening gadget from wilko works with any pot size or shapeShareByDave Masters:,  MAY AdvertorialThe balls act as a reservoir for your plants\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailKeeping your garden looking lush in the summer can be a full time job.

Kyle Burns, , was at football training when he became unwell and was rushed to Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock. It was thought he had strained his back at Galston Boysapos Club but he collapsed minutes after arriving at AE. Doctors discovered a rare clot on his spinal cord had caused it to rip leaving him with no feeling from the ribs down. The teenager is now facing le in a wheelchair as it is unlikely he will be able to walk again, reports the Daily Record.    Mum Donna, , said: “When doctors told me the news I just ran out the room crying. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “Just hours earlier he had been running around playing the sport he lived for and then we were being told Kyle would never walk again.” The promising young player’s injuries were so rare, doctors had to take advice from experts in London before deciding how to proceed. Donna added: “They said the only thing they could compare it to was like someone being shot in the back with a shotgun. “The medical staff said thatKyle had fallen out of a window  storeys high the injuries to his spine wouldn’t have been as severe. “They’ve said they have never had to treat something so bad, that’s how rare it is.”  Doctors diagnosed a fibrocartilaginous embolism, a sudden blocking of an artery which in turn led to a spinal stroke, causing the cord to tear. Medics ruled out surgery and Kyle’s heartbroken family were given the news that there was no treatment to restore his mobility. The tragedy happened last Thursday and the youngster is now facing weeks of gruelling rehabilitation to become strong enough just to use a wheelchair. Donna, from Galston, Ayrshire, added: “I can’t believe this is where we are now. Kyle had come home with his coach complaining of a sore back and walked into accident and emergency. “Within an hour of arriving, he just deteriorated. He collapsed and said to me, ‘Mum, I can’t feel my legs, please help me.’ “The doctors at Crosshouse Hospital couldn’t believe it was the same boy who had come in and he was bluelighted to the spinal ward at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.” The Loudoun Academy pupil was rushed for MRI scans, which revealed the devastating extent of his injuries. Donna, who is also mum to Jamie, , Thomas, eight, and four-year-old Cooper, decided to wait a few days before breaking the news to Kyle.  She admits the youngster is struggling to come to terms with his paralysis. She said: “It was a massive shock for me and I thought, ‘How on earth do I tell my -year-old son he’s never going to walk again ’ It’s the most dficult thing I’ve ever had to do. I’m trying to stay strong for Kyle. “I’ve spent the last week in tears, I’m heartbroken for him. He dreamed of becoming a footballer and it feels like he’s been robbed of the le he wanted. “I don’t want him to see me upset because I have to stay positive. It’s just such a horrendous thing for any child to go through. The reality hasn’t hit him yet and I don’t think he will really process the extent of it all until he is in a wheelchair. “At the moment, he’s lying in a hospital bed in the spinal unit and can’t really do much. “He starts rehab on Tuesday and being in a wheelchair for the first time will be a big challenge for Kyle. He just can’t get his head around it.”  Donna, who has been allowed to stay by Kyle’s side at the hospital, says the family are overwhelmed by the support they have received from relatives and friends. They have set up a fundraising drive to buy a state-of-the-art electric wheelchair which they hope will give the teen more independence when he is finally allowed home. Donna added: “Kyle is such a popular lad at school and everyone is getting behind him. “He’s not seen any of his friends yet and I think not being able to run around and do the things he is used to will be very tough.  “His football team have been in contact to offer their support. No one can believe this has happened. “He’s the type of wee boy who gives everything  per cent and he’s always been so active. He loves playing football, basketball and rugby but now it has all been taken away from him. “We want to give him the best wheelchair so that he feels more comfortable. He want’s a white one that he thinks looks really cool. “We also have to look at adapting our home in the future to accommodate Kyle’s needs.

The Richardson gang were the Kray twins biggest rivals  and were known as the capitalaposs most sadistic gangsters. They are said to have pulled teeth out using pliers, cut off toes with bolt cutters and even nailed their victims to the floor. In his explosive book, Eddie has lted the lid on what really happened in Londonaposs gangs in the s. Here he reveals what happened during the gun fight at Mr Smithaposs in Catford.The events of that night lead to Reggie Kray gunning down George Cornell in the Blind Beggar pub Whitechapel - and the end of the Kray twinsapos reign. An old pal of mine had an interest in a club in Catford called Mr Smith’s. In March , the place was having trouble with rowdy customers.  The owner, who was from Blackpool, got in touch with my associate Billy Hill and asked him to sort to  it out. Bill asked me and that’s why we were there. The owners wanted to maintain a gaming licence, so had to keep an orderly establishment with gambling and dancing and drinking over and the place closed by am. The deal was that I would organise the ‘security’ inside and on the door of Mr Smith’s. Inwe’d get to place our slot machines in the club we were double dipping with more than one dog in the race. It was a neat, lucrative deal for us and there was no haggling in fact they were really glad of such an arrangement. It was such a good prospect that we went over to the place on Monday,  March  for a look round. Bertie Green from the Astor Club provided the entertainment and the girls. It was a lovely place, the club. A raised dining area, dance floor and a place, a stage, for entertainment. It had the makings of a nice earner.    Everyone was interested in there not being any trouble at Mr Smith’s and, of course, there was no need for there to be. Nice grub, nice drink and nice girls to look at. Where’s the problem  We were well welcomed but did not stay for lunch, saying we’d come back in the evening and sign off on our deal. The snag was a group of local hard men who had decided they were in charge of the club’s protection infor free drinks and whatever  they could get were there when we ed. Another of the locals, Billy Haward, was having it off with the we of one of our mechanics at Atlantic Machines, and he thought it was personal. We couldn’t give a f**k who he was shagging – unless it got in the way of our business – but it had him on edge. There was Frank and I, Harry Rawlins, Ronnie Jeffreys and Billy Staynton, in our little drinks party. I saw the other blokes, they were familiar but on nodding terms: Billy Haward, Billy Gardiner, Henry Botton, and Peter Hennessy.    At that point, around  pm, I never imagined it was going to turn out like the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, but it did. Maybe not in so many dead, but in the legend of London gangland it was the beginning of the end of an era. I’ll try and do it justice but it happened quickly. I got the shotgun treatment. I’ve got a load of pellets in my leg half a century and more later. I’ve had a knee replacement, and when they X-rayed my knee, the technician asked: ‘What’s all that ’ It’s still there. As is my memory. The atmosphere was tense and I tried to lighten the evening up, kept the drinks coming. I’d talked to the management and our deal was done. We were in charge of security and good order in the club. And, then, Jimmy Moody, who I knew but who was a friend of Harry Rawlins, came in and joined us for a drink. The paranoid Billy Haward panicked, for he knew Moody was someone who could make problems vanish, in a puff of smoke, as it were. [Jimmy Moody became a multiple killer and IRA hitman and was himself assassinated on  June  at the Royal Hotel, by Victoria Park, Hackney, East London. That Tuesday evening the pub, Moody’s ‘local’, was quiet at  pm when his killerwandered in, ordered a pint of Foster’s lager, and put two one-pound coins on the bar. Without touching his drink, he stood away from the bar, turned and shot four bullets from a Webley . revolver into the -stone body of Moody.  The execution over, the gunman calmly left the pub and drove off in a white Ford Fiesta. He was never caught.] Haward was joined by his other mate, Dickie Hart, just out of jail for GBH, and they sent out for tools, for guns. Hart got a . pistol and Haward a sawn-off . double-barrelled shotgun, cut down to the size of a big handgun. He believed he was the boss being tooled up in the place he thought of as his HQ. It never had been anything to do with him, and with us on a nice retainer it was startlingly out of his league now. When it came to the off, I had no idea about Haward’s love le or that they were armed – that Haward was better dressed than he looked with a sawn-off shotgun under his jacket, and Dickie Hart also had an accessory, an automatic in a shoulder holster. These guys thought they were Jimmy Cagney. In Catford. Although, the way things went down, it was the Wild West. To keep within the law the drinks had to be over by am and the management guys told me that Haward and his lot were refusing to go. It was am. I was being paid to sort that. I was restless and getting edgy. There just wasn’t any reason for trouble. As good as I could be, I leaned over, no verbals, and suggested it was time to call it a night, the staff wanted to clean up and shut. Haward stared at me: ‘What the f*** is it to do with you ’    I stayed calm. I told him: ‘I’m running the door here from now on it will be my blokes on the door.’ Peter Hennessy was a big fellow and he went wild, he went off on one, and I could see Haward bringing up the shotgun. Dickie Hart had pulled his gun out. Harry Rawlins grabbed at the shotgun and hit Haward over the head with it but Dickie Hart shot him with the pistol, puncturing an artery in Harry’s left arm which spurted blood showering into the air. Hennessy yelled at me: ‘You, I’m gonna have a f****** straightener with you.’ ‘You want a straightener, you can have one,’ I told him. We went out to the dance floor and went at it. There were guns about and I expected a bullet in the back at any moment. Hennessy was a big bloke and he was relentless. He was landing them on me – good, solid punches – but the more he connected, the more he hurt me, the more I gave him back. I thumped him and he went down. I got astride him and I wanted to punch his head through the floorboards but he was shouting: ‘I’ve had enough, I’ve had enough.’  I was on a no-win with the guns but I won the fight. Hennessy was out of the game and I was breathless. When I turned around it was a bloody circus, the fighting had burst over into the back of the room. Frankie Fraser had leaped on Hart right after Harry Rawlins was wounded. They were fighting with Frank and a couple of others struggling to get the gun off Hart. Frank took a bullet in his side from Hart’s ., right through, smashing his thigh bone. He was crippled by it but still trying to get at the gun. Hart’s gun was turned on him and he was shot. I know who did it but I won’t say. Haward was smashed over the head and wounded with an iron railing. Ronnie Jeffreys got a shotgun blast in the groin and stomach. I didn’t feel it at the time but I also suffered a shotgun blast, all across my buttocks and the back of my leg. Frankie Fraser had made it outside but only to a next-door garden, where he’d collapsed. It was Harry Rawlins who was in true trouble. Jimmy Moody came good and got a tourniquet on Harry’s arm and I think that probably stopped him bleeding out fatally. The street was lighting up like a Christmas tree and we had to get out of there. Jimmy’s Jaguar was nearest and I helped him get Harry into it and we were off. Jimmy got out of the area and when we thought we were a decent distance from the trouble, he dropped us at East Dulwich Hospital. Jimmy scarpered when he knew the doctors had got to Harry and me. It didn’t look good for Harry who couldn’t speak and the doctor said was ‘in danger of dying’. He was on a drip right away. I told them I was George Ward, first name I could think of. I said I had no idea who Harry was.    The police had collected Frankie and Ronnie Jeffreys from outside Mr Smith’s and taken them to Lewisham Hospital. They’d found Dickie Hart comatose, lying under a lilac tree, and taken him there, too, and that’s where he died. As I saw it we were the victims. We’d gone to the club unarmed and not looking for trouble and now we were shot up. Frankie’s leg had been shattered by the . bullet and my leg had ballooned up with lead poisoning.Harry Rawlins was all but dying in the hospital bed next to me. But, of course, the police appeared like bad weather when you don’t need it.Neither Harry or I were able to move far, but two coppers were put on duty to guard the side ward we were in put in. I was saying nothing, and announced that in front of the hospital staff as I didn’t want some copper making up statements for me. For the cops the total was four seriously wounded, one dead: it was the start and the end all at once. I was charged with ‘making an affray’ and Frankie was charged with the murder of Dickie Hart and stashed in the hospital wing of Wandsworth Prison. The others on our side of the trouble were remanded with me in Brixton. Charlie was in South Africa with Jean Lagrange, f**king her and, unbeknown to him or me, the rest of our lives. Still, when he heard of my trouble he got the first flight back to start fixing whatever was necessary. Yet, in the moment, that geography made Ronnie Kray very brave. I was in jail. Frankie Fraser was in a hospital bed in a high security prison. Charlie was in South Africa. Ron Kray couldn’t believe his luck. On  March , two nights after the gunfight at Mr Smith’s, Ronnie Kray shot George Cornell dead.

The Queen and other top royals arrived and there was one surprise visitor as Prince Philip was by her side despite limiting his public appearances of late. The newlyweds shared a kiss on the steps of St Georgeaposs Chapel surrounded by friends and family this afternoon and will now move onto the reception which is being held at Frogmore House - where Meghan and Harry staged their wedding dinner.The similarities donapost end there as the couple will also cut a cake made by Fiona Cairns, who also created the wedding cake for Prince Harry and Meghan.Guests were due to be served smoked Scottish salmon and asparagus risotto and canapes, as well as Caragh Chocolates from the Isle of Sark - where the couple became engaged.During the wedding service hymns sung by the congregation were Tell Out My Soul, Be Thou My Vision and Love Divine, All Loves Excelling. The readings were taken from Ecclesiastes III, Philippians IV, a passage from Shakespeareaposs Loveaposs Labouraposs Lost, and O Tell Me The Truth About Love, by WH Auden.

The beaming bride had her long veil arranged by the designer on the steps of the chapel. The bridal party - of six bridesmaids and three pageboys - entered the th-century chapel moments before.  The Queen was arrived dressed in Fuchsia pink and Philip appeared in good spirits and joked with the Dean of Windsor, the Right Reverend David Conner, who was waiting to greet the monarch and her consort.

The bride and groom chose Paul Thomas to design the flower arrangements for the service and flowers in St Georgeaposs Chapel included coral sunset peonies, coral and white roses, white hydrangea, white delphiniums, apricot stocks and seasonal flowers.   The pageboys were Frederick Murray, Rafferty Murray and Karim Khawaja. They wore cream shirts and knickerbockers. Their shoes were by Papouelli.

The Duke of York arrived by car with his ex-we Sarah, the Duchess of York, and their daughter Princess Beatrice and her boyfriend Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. Guests were ferried in vintage buses close to St Georgeaposs Chapel at Windsor Castle and then walked down the hill to take their seats for the ceremony.The society event had been a parade of hats, dresses and men in morning suits. Pippa Middleton, who used to date the groom, arrived with her husband James Matthews, along with her parents Carole and Matthew Middleton and brother James Middleton. Pippa was all smiles in a light blue dress from Kate Spade and a blue headband as she walked with her husband James. Thomas Kingston dated Pippa after she split from cricketer Alex Loudon in . The pair have stayed friends over the years and Pippa invited both Gabriella and Thomas to her wedding in     The first guests arrived from am onwards after being dropped off by bus.

Jim Gamble, formerly the UKaposs top child protection officer, headed the immediate investigation into the infantaposs disappearance. Maddie, aged just three at the time, vanished from her familyaposs holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, in Portugal,  years ago. Despite a desperate search, no trace of Madeleine has been found. Mr Gamble told the Daily Star investigators will one day crack the case - but only when the offender or their associates confess. He said: I genuinely believe that either a prompt to someone’s conscience or the advances in modern technology will take us to a point in my letime where we find out what happened to Madeleine.    “I absolutely believe that. If this involves an abductor, someone will have seen something. “Someone will have suspected something and for personal loyalty perhaps, a relationship, or whatever  – the fact that they’ve been unsure, they’ll have kept that to themselves. “But as time goes on, relationships change and people who’ve done things have le changing experiences that make them feel the need to tell. I think that can happen.    Mr Gamble was featured in The Disappearance Of Madeleine McCann, the Netflix documentary which has reignited interest in the traumatic affair. He also argued that technological advances will offer up new leads in the case, as detectives continue their hunt for missing girl. Investigatorsapos primary theory is that she was snatched by child traffickers or predators. Another possible explanation is that Maddie was taken during a botched burglary. But it is understood that officers are closing in on a suspect.    The politan Police is pursuing “two final lines of inquiry”, with an additional £, set to be made available by the Home Office. The Operation Grange investigation is expected to run until the end of March . Just a week ago Madeleineaposs parents, Kate and Gerry, marked her th birthday, by laying out presents in her untouched bedroom.    It is believed they held a party at their home in Rothley, in Leicestershire, to honour their missing daughter. The couple wrote on the Official Find Madeleine Campaign Facebook page: Happy th Birthday, Madeleine! We love you and we’re waiting for you and we’re never going to give up.”    A friend of the family said: “There will be prayers and quiet reflection, but also a cake and presents to mark her turning  - a signicant age.” Earlier this month Kate and Gerry -  and , respectively - opened up about the occasion, saying that she should be here and we should be celebrating with her.

It was published today and we got to learn a few new bits of information about Archie Harrison. The little royal was born on May , but until today we didnapost know where Meghan had given birth. And while royal fans were delighted to see the exciting paperwork, some were a tad confused by some of the details. So here are some of the key points explained.    Why is Meghanaposs job description Princess when sheaposs a Duchess  Under the aposMotherapos section, it says Princess of the United Kingdom. But Meghanaposs official title is Duchess, isnapost it  Yes - she was given the title the Duchess of Sussex by the Queen on her wedding day, which is how she is officially referred to. However she is also technically a princess, just not in her own name. She is Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Wales through her husband. The Duchess of Cambridge also listed princess under the job section part of the form on Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louisaposs birth certicates.    Why is Meghanaposs name listed as Rachel, not Meghan  Under the name section, it reads: Rachel Meghan Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex. Even though we all know her as Meghan, the Duchessapos real name is actually Rachel. Her parents have called her Meghan since birth. All of her friends call her Meghan, with many also referring to her as Megs in interviews. It was also the name of her popular character in her hit legal drama Suits.  And why is Prince Harry listed as Henry  Just like his we, Harry also doesnapost use his real name. His parents Prince Charles and Diana named him Henry, but said from the start he would be known as Harry. Heaposs used the nickname ever since, and itaposs now only official paperwork which has his full name.  Why doesnapost Archie have a title  When they announced Archieaposs name, Meghan and Harry also confirmed that their son wouldnapost have a HRH title. He technically shouldnapost have had one thanks to his positioning. Even though heaposs seventh in line to the throne, about Princess Beatrice and Eugenie who both have titles, he will be bumped down considerably when George, Charlotte and Louis have kids of their own. The Queen could have given him a title, but itaposs unlikely that the couple wanted this as they seem determined to give him a aposnormalapos le.

Cheryl Shaw, , was born with congenital malanocytic naevus, a rare condition which causes large moles to grow all over sufferersapos bodies.She told the Birmingham Mail that she has been mocked and bullied for it her whole le. After sharing photos of herself on Instagram , she has now been snapped up by a leading agency which specialises in models with dferent and distinctive looks.Cheryl plans to juggle modelling gigs for Models of Diversity with her day job as practice manager for a GP surgery.    She said: I couldnapost believe it when they contacted me. My boysand my mum are so proud of me. Now I just want to inspire other people who look dferent - especially women with my condition. Congenital malanocytic naevus has followed Cheryl her entire le. Even as a baby loved ones were reluctant to hold her because of her condition. As she grew older, she discovered ways to conceal her large moles.    She got hold of professional skin make-up from a dermatologist, and always covered her arms and legs in public. Even in summer, she would wear three layers of thick tights when wearing a skirt. She also refused to go swimming - both at schoolgirl and with her kids. Cheryl, from Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, said: Iaposve been called names like aposspotty faceapos, aposDalmatianapos and aposcookieapos. It made me hate myself and dislike the way I looked, as I felt it wasn’t normal. Summer was always a struggle as I used to wear thick layers of clothing because of the name calling. People used to stare at me and refused to sit next to me on a bus. Her le changed dramatically one year as frustrations boiled over while packing for a summer holiday.  She said: I decided that enough was enough and asked myself, how am I going to change this  I ordered a few shorts and decided to wear them on holiday, and I didn’t care what anyone thought. Slowly I started to love myself and build up my confidence. Now I know that not everyone has to be the same to be beautul - accepting who I am has changed my attitude. I couldn’t be happier with myself now. Waking up every morning knowing Iaposm able to be confident in my own skin is such a good feeling. With this modelling opportunity I want those who are suffering with skin conditions, disabilities, scarring and weight issues to think that no matter what peopleaposs opinions are, or what you class as flaws, can be classed as someone ’s perfection. She was contacted by Models of Diversity four weeks ago - and not looked back since.The agency promotes people who do not conform to the classic model ideal.On their books are models with a range of disabilities , or have undergone amputations. A spokeswoman for the Models of Diversity said: We see no reason why Cheryl couldnapost do any editorial, fashion or media work. She is professional, hard-working and beautul. We campaign for more models of ersity to be in the fashion, beauty and media industry - be it colour, size, age or ability. Every area of society should be represented.

Public Heath England says it is working with councils to stamp out the virus before it spreads wider by encouraging people to keep up to date with their vaccinations The news follows a recent study which has argued deadly cases of measles will be endemic in the UK within decadesvaccines are not made compulsory for school children. The study argues that precautions currently being taken to control the disease will not continue to work and suggests compulsory vaccination.   Although exact figures have not been revealed, a spokesman for Public Health England told to The Daily Star there had been an increase of cases in both regions in the past few weeks. A parent of a pupil at Giles Nursey and Infantsapos School in Stevenage told The Comet :I am actually in disbelief that Iaposve just been sent an email from my childrenaposs school to say there is an outbreak of measles in Hertfordshire.There is no excuse for this disease to have made a comeback when it is so easily preventable. If you are able to, get vaccinated. Across Europe, around , have already been infected with the virus in a recent outbreak. According to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control there have been  confirmed cases of measles in the United Kingdom between April last year and March this year - which makes the UK the fth highest in Europe behind Italy, France, Romania and Greece.    Measles is a highly infectious viral illness and symptoms include sore red eyes, a high temperature and cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing and coughing. This week Public Health England re-shared a blog post from last year which discussed why the UK still sees cases and outbreaks of measles despite it being eliminated by the World Health Organisation.

But the picture for other regions is mixed and the south of England could bask in temperatures of up to C during brief outbreaks of sunshine.

Met Office forecaster Richard Miles said: Rain will be coming in from the East to northern England and Scotland.    He added: It could get quite heavy in Scotland and the eastern slopes. Overall the weekend will be cold and damp - while the South will be fine. Overnight it could get as low as C on the Eastern coast between Newcastle and Hull.  The dreary weather will also affect Scotland where the mercury will struggle to stay above C. Met officeaposs Greg Dewhurst said: The weekend will be more unsettled compared to what we have seen. This is because the low pressure will be in charge, replacing the high pressure which has caused the warmer sunshine. He added: This low pressure is moving in from Europe, bringing with it showery conditions on Saturday. Parts of northern England will be cloudy, with bouts of showery, even heavy rain.  Southern areas and in Northern Ireland and Wales there will be a mix of sun and showers. On Sunday the whole of the UK will see some sunshine and rain, with a risk of thunder.

Theresa May was forced to turn to Labour because the splits within her own party made getting a deal through Parliament impossible. So it is a bit rich for the Prime Minister to blame the collapse of the negotiations on ­isions within the Labour Party. The reason Brexit has unravelled is because of the multiple mistakes by Mrs May, who failed to persuade her own party to back her botched and unloved withdrawal agreement.    Jeremy Corbyn entered the talks in good faith. He was unable to make progress because of the Conservatives’ unwillingness to compromise and Mrs May’s looming departure. Labour was seeking important guarantees to protect workers’ and environmental rights. As these could be ripped up within seconds of the new Tory leader taking office, any agreement struck with Mrs May was valueless. This was a crisis imposed on the country by the Tories. The blame for the failure to deliver Brexit rests solely with them. Halt barbarism    Shooting an endangered animal with a high-powered rle is not sport. Such barbaric acts are the height of cowardice by people with large bank balances, but no understanding of conservation. As we report today, hundreds of hippos continue to be slaughtered each year by trophy hunters. Wildle experts say the species is already at risk because of poaching. Their chance of survival is even less likely as long as the market in trophy hunting is allowed to continue. It is time to ban those who make money out of animal cruelty.

She placed the baby in a bucket before disposing of Ms Ochia-Uriosteguiaposs body. That is when she called , claiming to have just given birth and saying the baby was not breathing.

Busloads of visitors enter the town daily for a unique opportunity to see the ghost town of Pripyat in northern Ukraine which has stood abandoned since the  crisis. Interest in Chernobyl grown has rapidly and around , visitors took the trip last year, making it one of Kievaposs most popular tourist draws. The phenomenon is an example of aposdark tourismapos, a loose term for travellers who seek out destinations associated with the tragic and macabre. The disaster, which caused at least  deaths, has now spawned a Sky Atlantic show. Chernobyl, like Hiroshima or Cambodiaaposs aposKilling Fieldsapos, is a sobering reminder of the destructive potential of humanity. In April  a small explosion, largely the result of poor design and human error, critically damaged Chernobylaposs number  reactor.  The stricken plant spewed out dangerous materials into the atmosphere and created a radioactive plume that travelled as far as Sweden. Some , inhabitants were evacuated from the once thriving towns of Chernobyl and Pripyat and dozens of volunteer firefighters died in an attempt to extinguish a chemical fire that burned for days. Their heroic efforts prevented a second fission blast which would have caused untold destruction across Eastern Europe.  Many others succumbed to the effects of irradiation but the exact death toll has never been fully disclosed. It remains the worldaposs worst ever nuclear accident. Radiation levels have fallen drastically in the intervening years and the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, a km perimeter near the Ukraine-Belarus border, was officially opened to tourists in . Despite this, security remains tight and the zone is strictly off-limits to those without an entry permit and identication.  Ukraine has made giant strides in recent years but remains poor by European standards. The advantages of such tourism to the local economy are obvious.  A kiosk at the checkpoint offers a range of items for sale including gas masks, Geiger counters. You can also enjoy a aposChernobyl hotdogapos or some aposradioactive cookiesapos. One particularly imposing billboard advertises tours at the gates to the exclusion zone. Locals generally stay away from visiting Chernobyl any many still clearly remember the crisis which unfolded over the May Day celebrations of that year.  The ghost town of Pripyat - once upheld by Soviet planners as a workersapos utopia – has been abandoned for over three decades but haunting signs of its former le remain.  Rows of empty apartment blocks, restaurants, a supermarket and even a cinema are still standing, seemingly frozen in time since the evacuation. Former workers at the ‘Atomgrad’ fondly remember how the shelves of the then newly-built supermarket were stacked with food and luxury items such as French perfume which were scarce where in the USSR. One unexpected side-effect has been the re-emergence of wild animals which are flourishing thanks to the disappearance of humans.  Wild horses and deer freely roam its perimeter which has become an unlikely nature reserve. The peacefulness has also attracted the attention of nature-loving aposstalkersapos who live in the zone undetected for weeks at a time until they are caught by disapproving authorities. Chernobyl certainly falls into the aposdark tourismapos categorisation and some allege its recent commercialisation is in poor taste. After all, people alive today still suffer form the effects of the devastating radiation leak. Humans have long been fascinated with similarly chilling events in history, as enduring interest in Pompeii and Jack the Ripper shows.  Professor Philip Stone, an executive director for the Institute for Dark Tourism Research at University of Central Lancashire, has spent much of his career examining this phenomenon. Itaposs an old concept in a new world - from the gladiatorial games and medieval torture weaposve always had some form of dark tourism, he says. Now, itaposs more a process of how we remember the dead. Mr Stone says there is a fine line between commemoration and commercialisation and visiting such sites can be a moral minefield particularly with the rise of selfie photography at places like Auschwitz. Sergeii Ivanchuk, who claims to be the first person to bring in tourists into Chernobyl back in , says his customer base has grown from a handful to over , last year.    His company, Solotours, brings in around  to  people every day, with a signicant number of those visitors coming from Britain. Despite buoyant business, he says he is somewhat troubled by Chernobylaposs recent commercialisation including the privately-run checkpoint kiosks which sell nuclear-themed items and gimmicks. He still remembers the deafening quiet in his home city of Kiev during the crisis which struck when he was as -year-old student. Itaposs a tragedy for the Ukrainians and there should be some limitations as to what is sold there, Mr Ivanchuk said, adding that it should be free for locals to visit the site which remains etched in the countryaposs psyche.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"one way to keep tarbert flowing","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTarbert is about to get a new, improved sewer serving the village.Roads, however, will have to be dug up to replace existing underground pipes.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

reassess the regionrsquos CCTV networks, following news it is being allowed to fall into disrepair.Recently, council officers reported that the CCTV network is ldquono longer fit for purpose.And it was revealed that neither the local authority nor the police can afford to install and maintain the security systems.Currently,  of the councilrsquos  CCTV cameras dont work, and that number is likely to increase in the coming months and years.Now, Tweeddale East councillor, Stuart Bell, has put forward a motion for the local authorityrsquos next meeting, asking officers to produce a list of options for revitalising the failing CCTV network.He said: ldquoEffective public CCTV can make a positive contribution to community safety which is primarily the responsibility of the police but one in which the council has an obvious part to play.ldquoHowever, the capability of the system now operating in Border towns has deteriorated.ldquoWhilst there are limited budgeted council funds to invest in the current CCTV system, and whilst there will be advantages in opening up opportunities for communities to participate in the definition of what is needed, any decisions need to be based on a quantied assessment of costs.ldquoI ask officers to prepare a report showing the costs and options for renewing or replacing existing public CCTV for each community with a CCTV system to make that information part of a consultation with area partnerships, community planning partners and the police, fire and rescue, and safer communities board, before bringing forward a final report for consideration by this council.ldquoFurther to this that officers bring a report to the next Council meeting with a consultation plan, including whether outside resources will need to be brought in, the cost of consultation and a timescale for that consultation and final report to be brought to council.There are eight systems, all of which are operated by Police Scotland, in Duns, Eyemouth, Galashiels, Hawick, Kelso, Melrose, Peebles and Selkirk.Scottish Borders Council is currently spending pound, a year repairing the systems, and officers have advised councillors that this will continue until the CCTV cameras are ldquobeyond economic repair.Police Scotland have also confirmed that although they view the CCTV systems as a valuable resource, they will not be providing funding for their maintenance.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer has thrown his weight behind the motion.He said: ldquoCCTV plays a vital role is helping prevent and solve crime and I find it completely incomprehensible that decisions that impact the safety, health and well-being of our communities can be taken without a full and complete assessment of the consequences.ldquoOnly this week

cyclists.Several Borders bobbies have saddled up as part of the nationwide campaign.Operation Close Pass was launched after research found many drivers are unaware that by passing to close to a cyclist, they can gain up to three points on their licence.Police will ditch the unorm and don bike-mounted cameras in attempt to catch drivers who get too close for comfort over the coming weeks.They will radio aheada driver passes too close and offenders will be pulled over for a warning.Inspector Richard Latto of the Lothians and Scottish Borders Road Policing Unit said: ldquoThe safety of all road users, especially those in the vulnerable category, remains a priority for Police Scotland and Operation Close Pass is one way we can educate and inform road users of the necessary passing space for cyclists.ldquoRural roads can present additional challenges, such as changing road conditions, dferences in speed limits, narrower roadways and changes in weather conditions.ldquoWersquod encourage all road users to share the road space responsibly whilst adhering to appropriate speeds within the limits.With  official bicycle routes in  locations, it is clear to see why cyclists love the Scottish Borders.However, they cannot always hear traffic behind them due to rushing wind and accidents can easily occurmotorists donrsquot respect the highway code.Gary Robson, owner of Bspoke cycles in Peebles, told us that close passing is a frequent hazard for cyclists.He said: ldquoImagine that the bike you are about to pass is a mother with a pram or a horse and rider.ldquoYoursquore going to slow down and show respect by passing at a safe enough distance.ldquoWhen drivers start to think of bike riders as sons, daughters, parents, grandparents and not just as bikes then we will all be able to share the road safely.Police Scotlandrsquos recent survey found  percent of people asked were not aware that close passing was a practice resulting in three penalty points.Consisting of over  Scottish men and women the poll showed most were unaware of the consequences of failing to leave a carrsquos width of space when overtaking a cyclist.In the Scottish Borders cycling accidents occur fairly regularly on Borders roads - and there have been fatalities in the past decade.Cyclists in groups have taken to riding two a breast on the road in order to use up the same space as a vehicle forcing the motorists to slow down and wait until it is safe to overtake.This method has not been free of criticism however as motorists often find it dficult to overtake two cyclists safely rather than give one bike more room.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Borders welcomes tens of thousands of cyclists every year who are here to enjoy some of the best on and off-road cycling that Scotland has to offer.ldquoAs well as local cyclists and cycling groups, we fully support Cycling Scotland and Police Scotland in raising awareness of the risks to riders and the penalties for drivers who overtake too closely.\"Belles on Bikes is a Scottish initiative set up for women to cycle together socially.They have  independent groups across Scotland run by volunteers who are passionate about helping women enjoy cycling and feel safe.One member of the Scottish Borders branch is Brenda Mitchell, a senior partner at Cycle Law Scotland, which is based in Peebles.Brenda told us: ldquoClose passing is incredibly dangerous and there is a huge need for the campaign in every region of Scotland.ldquoOne incident springs to mind involving an elderly male who was overtaken by an HGV far too closely catching the cyclist with the backdraft resulting in him crashing and injuring his clavicle.ldquoWith those incidents you have to remember the highway code as a motorist must give as much room to a cyclist as they would a car.ldquoIt is a super initiative as it focusses on educating drivers as cycling in the Borders has become such a popular activity.ldquoHowever, I find the drivers in the Borders more courteous on average, as most leave the acceptable distance when overtaking.ldquoAs cycling is so big in the Borders, many drivers know how it feels to be on both sides of the wheel and take the necessary steps to make cyclists feel safe.ldquoRespecting one another when sharing road space is key as cyclists also have a duty to be courteous towards drivers.With the tenth year of the TweedLove Bike Festival next month, and Tour orsquo the Borders ing for a third year, cycling tourism in the Borders is continuing to grow.Thanks to Border Buses and the Borders Railway becoming accessible for bike users, people from all over Scotland can travel to the Borders for a dayrsquos cycling in a more energy efficient way.Brenda added: ldquoAs people are becoming more aware of global warming issues, they know it is a good idea to cycle shorter distances instead of driving.ldquoHowever, many people are put off getting on their bikes

The British Dietetic Association has long recognised that we can get all the nutrients we need on a fully plant-based diet, at every stage of le.ldquoIf Glasgow and East Renfrewshire councils can produce vegan menus that comply with guidelines, so too can Scottish Borders Council.ldquoAs a result of the councilrsquos refusal, the eldest child of the vegan parent had already missed out on free school meals in P-.ldquoI wrote to Scottish Borders Council challenging their refusal to provide vegan meals, pointing out their legal obligations under human rights and equality law.

It is not acceptable that vegan children are missing out on free school meals, or that they are excluded from eating in the school canteen with their friends.ldquoWe should be supporting children who have made a moral decision to avoid animal use and killing, recognising the impact their behaviour has on others.

The Gododdin resisted the invasion. The great early poem Y Gododdin tells us of a great assemblage of warriors who feasted at Edinburgh before heading south to their deaths in battle.What wailing and sadness there must have been when the news of the loss of all those young, handpicked warriors arrived. The Goddodinsrsquo fate was soon sealed, the Angles took control of the land and the Lothians became part of the Northumbrian kingdom. The remnants of the disposed Gododdin migrated to Wales, it seems, taking with them their stories and legends of what became known as lsquothe old northrsquo.These were my thoughts as I found the remains on an old round house as we climbed to the summit of the Law. At first I wasnrsquot sure ndash it looked almost like a small standing stone circle ndash but on closer examination I realised the stones were the foundations of a Celtic round house. An archaeologist friend later confirmed this.There are at least  Iron Age round houses or similar structures so far discovered on the Law some are less obvious. Butyou carefully study the ground as you ascend, evidence of these ancient homes can be seen. There is also evidence of old walls or ramparts.So here a community of the Gododdin once lived. From their front doors they could see their sister forts of Dun Penderbut now named Traprain Law, and Din Eidyn, later to be called Edinburgh.So I entered the circle of stones as my kids played on a rock nearby. I was now in a space where once a family might have lived. It was not large, but then again, why would it be  It was a place to sleep and sit round the fire together. No need to make space for all the modern lsquonecessitiesrsquo of le. Their le would have been lived outdoors. But what stories were told in this intimate space, what lives were led, and when was the last night this was used as a home There is lots more to the history of North Berwick Law. The watch house from the Napoleonic period, the observation bunker from the Second World War and, of course, the whale bones, which are now made of fibreglass. All these connect to stories that make up the history of this fascinating wee hill.But for me on that day, it was the walk through prehistory, and the mysterious remains from an ancient Celtic people, that left my imagination tingling."},{"url":null,"title":"golfers-surprise-as-he-finds-guinea-pig-on-golf-course","story":"Engineer William Waddell, , was playing in the Lady Captainrsquos Day at the club in Prestonpans on April  when his friend hit a wayward ball on the ninth hole.Donna, Williamrsquos we, said: ldquoHe was looking for his friendrsquos ball when he saw something moving in the grass ndash he took a closer look and saw it was a guinea pig!ldquoHe picked it up and handed it in to the pro shop.The family put pictures of the furry find on Facebook and, in no time at all, a young girl came forward with her dad, another club member, to take care of it until the owner could be found.Donna added: ldquoThe dad happened to be an expert on guinea pigs, judging and showing them up and down the country, so they were the perfect people to take care of it really.ldquoWersquove all had loads of messages on social media from people offering to give it a home, so whatever happens, Irsquom sure itrsquoll be loved.William and Donna live in Duns with their two children Kiera, , and Jaydon, .Donna added: ldquoWersquore really keen to find out what will happen to the wee thing.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"what-did-the-romans-ever-do-for-us-and-who-were-they-anyway","story":"Turning right at the Forth and Clyde Canal, the road squeezes between a stretch of grass and a bank of earth before it reaches Falkirk High School. Itrsquos the kind of break in the urban landscape you hardly register as you pass. A flash of green and itrsquos gone. Most days, my head too full of the dayrsquos business, it doesnrsquot even register. But now and again I look up and see the corner of Blinkbonny Road and imagine a Roman soldier standing shivering in the rain.Completed in  AD, the Antonine Wall stretched for some  miles across the neck of central Scotland, from Borsquoness in the east to Old Kirkpatrick on the River Clyde. Over the last two millennia parts of it have been dug up, built on and covered over. In Falkirk itself it appears and disappears, history as jack-in-the-box.On the corner of Blinkbonny Road there is a sectioned slice of it. The once massive Earth works are a mere dip here, a desire line tramped by thousands of kids at the start and end of the school day. Itrsquos a mere whisper in the landscape.Flow Country: Caithness bog could be on a par with PyramidsAnd yet the wall, partial as it now may be, is the dotted line that helps write Scotland into history. Not quite an origin story there were people living here for thousands of years before the Romans arrived of course. The wall itself was built nearly  years after Hadrianrsquos Wall, some  miles south.But in tandem the two walls perhaps represent the moment when an idea of Scotland itself swimmily begins to coalesce, as told by the words of Roman authors and the things those Romans left behind.Perhaps thatrsquos why we remain fascinated by these invaders. This weekend in Falkirk a new exhibition opens in Callendar House. Its an invasion itself, from Roman England, a collection of skeletons of men who may or may not have been gladiators, discovered in York. In that sense itrsquos an exhibition about the otherness of Rome, the strangeness of it, the savagery. Down the road in Haddington an exhibition of the treasures of the Traprain hoard is currently on display. Another chance to measure the distance from then to now.However far we might have come, though, we canrsquot escape. Historically, all roads lead to Rome.In William Holersquos th-century frieze of Scottish historical figures that runs around the entrance hall of the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, the earliest figures are all Romans. Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, the emperor who ordered the building of the Antonine Wall, Agricola, the governor in charge when the Roman army won a huge victory over the local tribes in Aberdeenshire in  AD, and the Roman historian Tacitus, who wrote an account of that conflict, along with Septimius Severus, who launched a brutal, doomed Roman invasion of Caledonia in the early third century.The great and powerful, in other words. But who was that shivering soldier on the Antonine Wall, looking north towards the Forth and the Ochils, watching out for painted locals sneaking up with a spear  Why did he come here  What was Roman Scotland like  What did they bring and what did they take  What was their legacy  In other words, to paraphrase Monty Python, what did they ever do for us  And who was ldquous anyway Read More: Walking the Antonine WallIn the National Museum of Scotland, Dr Fraser Hunter, curator of the Iron Age and Roman collections, is standing in front of a first-century Roman marble head that was found in Hawkshaw in the Borders. Who this man, with his bowl cut hair and rather sour features, is we donrsquot know. But we do know he was Roman, Hunter says. And that makes him stand out.ldquoHersquos probably a governor of Britain, most likely, Hunter suggests. ldquoHe would have been a Roman citizen. He would have been raised in one of the big metropolises on the Med. He would have had his classic three Roman names.He is also, Hunter adds, one of the few actual Romans we know of in Scotland. The truth is the Romans on the edge of the Roman Empire were small in number. Legions came and went. The grunt work was done by non-Romans.ldquoMost of the folk doing the actual fighting are auxiliaries, Hunter points out. ldquoAnd auxiliaries are not Roman citizens. Therersquos a very clear separation between those who are lsquousrsquo and those who are not quite lsquousrsquo. The legions, who are citizens, come in and do much of the initial fighting and they then mostly vanish further south.That means the soldier on both Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Antonine Wall would have been from France and Belgium, maybe eastern Europe. At Bar Hill, the highest fort on the Antonine Wall, looking out over the Kelvin Valley, there was even a unit of Hamian archers, originally from Syria.Itrsquos a measure of the multinational nature of the Roman empire, one that follows it right to the edge of that empire. All of this is spelt out in the things the Romans left behind. In the jewellery and ironwork and buildings and carvings and memorial stones and pottery.On Bar Hill, the Syrians brought tagines from north Africa to cook in. In the National Museum huge amphorae can be seen that would have brought wine and fish oil, the essentials of Roman le, to the north of Britain. \"Pottery is the tracer dye,\" Hunter points out.:  great places to enjoy Scotlands peerless wildleItrsquos also what marks them out from the people who lived here. \"The Romans were very materialistic, Geoff Bailey, Heritage Engagement Officer for Falkirk Community, tells me a few days later. \"Loads of pottery and bling.\"I meet Bailey at Rough Castle. One of  forts along the Antonine Wall , sited between Watling Lodge and Castlecary, its the second smallest, an acre and a half in size, protected on one side by the Rowantree Burn. Now its a palimpsest of what it was, a place to walk the dog and listen to the Edinburgh to Glasgow train whistle by.Read More: Septimius Severuss war on ScotlandThis morning, Bailey is conjuring up an image of what the fort once looked like for me. He points out where the commanders house would have been, the barracks and bath house. When it was built it would have been home to some  soldiers ndash Nervians mostly, from southern Belgium ndash who would look out across the Forth Valley towards the Ochils and down on a huge Roman fort in Camelon below and to the east.This is frontier territory. In front of the fort there are the outlines of Lilia, two-metre-long pits that would have contained fire-hardened wooden spikes possibly smeared in rancid animal fat. \"Even a scratch would prove fatal,\" says Bailey. \"This is a minefield.Squint your eyes and you can maybe see Rough Castle as a Roman equivalent of a th Cavalry outpost. To the soldiers posted here, it was a foreign place, Bailey points out. \"You are surrounded by people who speak a dferent language, have a completely dferent culture, who may or may not be friendly.\"What does that make these soldiers  ldquoThe real aliens in Bonnybridge, Bailey jokes.Fraser Hunter suggests that local hostility wasnrsquot a given though. ldquoWhen you look at the patterns of rebellion in Roman provinces, itrsquos the first generation. After a generation people get used to the idea. The real problems are those first  years.And the truth is a frontier culture grew up, one seen in the pottery and jewellery that has been left behind. ldquoSome of these iron age sites are choosing to fight, some are choosing to deal, argues Hunter. ldquoAnd coming out of these sites you are seeing a rich range of Roman finds.Romans had military might, but they could also flex their soft power. Gts can go a long way, Hunter suggests.ldquoTake a hoard like Lamberton Moor near the English border. Whoever buried this stuff had both Roman stuff ndash drinking vessels ndash and local drinking cups. They had locally made neck ornaments and Roman style brooches. So, they are really living in this in-between world. Theyrsquore neither Roman nor local.The empire, then, was never just a military expression. ldquoTherersquos the honour and glory of conquering the country, of course, says Hunter. ldquoBut therersquos also the practical question of what can you extract  Metals is one thing. They may have been lead mining in southern Scotland. They may have been looking for things like gold, wild animals. We know that when the Colosseum is opened, among the games one of the victims is a Caledonian bear which has been captured on the northern frontier and been shipped to Rome and then slaughtered in front of the baying masses.ldquoAnd presumably slaves are one of the things they were looking for. Thatrsquos one of the hidden things in these economies. Warfare gives you slaves and for the Roman market thatrsquos important.Inevitably, though,war was the first expression of empire. Both the Antonine Wall and Hadrianrsquos Wall are defensive fortications but also a symbol of Roman strength. They speak of the power of the Roman empire. Rough Castle, Bailey points out, ldquowould have said lsquoresistance is futile. Wersquore here to stay.rsquoBut who was resisting  The problem with Roman Scotland is that only one side got to write the story.In William Holes frieze in the portrait gallery the first Scot to appear is the rebel leader of the Caledonians, Calgacus. Whether he even existed or not is debateable. But he was given le by Tacitus in the historianrsquos account of Agricolas invasion of Britain. On the eve of a huge battle at Mons Graupius in Aberdeenshire in  AD, Tacitus recounts Calgacusrsquos speech to his , men.ldquoToday will be the birth of liberty for Britain, he said. ldquoWe will fight well because we are free. Here in the remote north, far away from the grasp of tyranny, have been born the best of men. The Romans are the pillagers of the world. Neither east nor west has sated them. To theft, murder and raping they give the  name of power. They make a desert and call it peace.Itrsquos a remarkable speech, one that would not sound out of place coming out of the mouths of later Scottish leaders. But in the end, itrsquos Roman rhetoric, Tacitus putting words in Calgacusrsquos mouth, and aiming them at a Roman audience. Tacitus is talking to his own side, questioning the imperial project.It should also be pointed out that Mons Graupius was a rout. The Romans put the Caledonians to the sword. Calgacus was the first Scottish leader who talked a good game, but couldnrsquot carry through.That said, the story of Roman Scotland is the story of repeated invasions and retreats. Indeed, the Antonine Wall was abandoned just over  years after it was built.Rome never conquered the whole of Scotland. Why not Fraser Hunter suggests there are two arguments, the nationalist and the internationalist. ldquoSo, the nationalist one is we were too tough, the landscape was too fierce, the climate was too horrible, the Romans just couldnrsquot cope.ldquoThe other side is the internationalist one which is that Britain just wasnrsquot important enough, Scotland just wasnrsquot important enough.ldquoAnd people argue fiercely over one or the other, and the truth is probably as ever somewhere in between.ldquoClearly, itrsquos a dficult frontier. But itrsquos also clear thatyoursquore given a choice between a rebellion in Britain and a rebellion on the Danube, the one you deal with is the Danube because itrsquos so much closer to Rome.ldquoSo, for example, the very first invasion of Roman Scotland under Agricola, they sweep north, therersquos the great battle of Mons Graupius which the Romans win. Theyrsquore poised to take over the rest of Scotland. And then a legion is pulled out because there is serious trouble on the Danube. The Danube is three daysrsquo march to Italy whereas you have to march a long way from the Antonine Wall to get anywhere near Rome.All empires fall in the end. In  AD the emperor Honorius told the cities of Britain to look to their own defences. The Dark Ageshad begun.Some  years later. Rough Castle is just an outline in the grass. The Roman fort in Camelon has long been built over. To find it now you would have to dig up Falkirk golf course, a railway line, a Tesco store and Alexanders the bus builders.And yet, the mark of Rome is still on us. It always has been. In the years after the Romans left the Antonine Wall was used as a road, suggests Geoff Bailey. A line of connection rather than ision.Settlements grew up along and on the wall. Theres a th-century motte-and-bailey castle at Watling Lodge. The wall continued to shape the geography of our lives.Flow Country: Caithness bog could be on a par with PyramidsBut more than that the Romans shaped how we think of ourselves. Therersquos a theory, Fraser Hunter suggests, that the Picts only started calling themselves the Picts when they began to read about themselves and saw the name in Roman texts.Our legal system, our language, our architecture, all of it drew on our classical heritage. ldquoThey may not have conquered the whole country but they changed everything that came afterwards, Hunter says.Somewhere inside there is a Roman in all of us.Gladiators: A Cemetery of Secrets is at Callendar House, Falkirk until October . Treasures from the Hoard, an exhibition of Roman silver, uncovered at Traprain Law continues at the John Gray Centre, Haddington, until October .GLADIATORS IN FALKIRKSarah Taylor on the story behind the \"gladiators\" in Callendar HouseIn  archaeologists in York began excavate sites in Drfield Terrace in the city. The area is part of what is known to be a vast Roman cemetery, just outside the city walls. Some  bodies were discovered, dating back to the second century, many of them showing signs of violence. Nearly half had been decapitated around the time of death.ldquoThere are multiple interpretations for this site and who the iniduals buried there could have possibly been, including soldiers or criminals, explains Sarah Taylor, exhibitions manager of the Jorvik Group. ldquoHowever, the high proportion of young adult males and the frequency of evidence of violent trauma could also indicate that they were gladiators. The demographic profile most closely resembles a site at Ephesus in ancient Greece, which has been interpreted as a burial ground for gladiators. There have been no similar discoveries in Roman Britain.One of the skeletons has unhealed bite marks from a large carnivore bite. ldquoDespite investigations, we still dont know exactly which animal caused this injury, admits Taylor. ldquoWe cant know how this bite would have occurred, however one element of the gladiatorial games was the venatio, or staged animal hunt, when criminals were thrown to the beasts."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-the-political-diary","story":"BUT why would a No voter join the SNP  ldquoMy position was never one of nationalism, Mr Macdonald explains. ldquoI joined the SNP purely because I wanted to understand their message.

The tech giant has invested more than pound million pounds to restore a Carnegie library in Washington, D.C.The iconic Beaux-Arts monument is just a mile away from the White House on Mount Vernon Square. Applersquos conservation experts took two years to revitalize the building, inside and out. The computer company now has a store and an educational facility in the  structure, which Apple will share with the current tenants, the Historical Society of Washington, D.C.The charity who also opened a brand new DC History Centre, complete with research library, three galleries, and a museum store.The restoration, however, just like the strike-breaking wage-depressing Carnegie, is not without its critics.

I just question whether or not it will ever really be as democratic and public as it originally was as a public library. Itrsquoll be intimidating to a lot of people who donrsquot have  or  to fork out for an iPhone.Meanwhile, Carnegiersquos legacy in Scotland is largely faring well. In total,  burghs and parish councils throughout Scotland received the tycoonrsquos assistance to establish one or more local public libraries. A review of those local authorities reveals that over % have Carnegie buildings that stillas libraries today, a testament not only to the man who made them possible but also to the locals who have used them and maintained them over the last century.Some buildings have recently benefited from renovations and extensions. The Dunfermline Carnegie Library, for example, the first the tycoon funded, in , underwent a three-year extension project that finished in .The Carnegie library in West Calder, originally opened in , also experienced a refresh in . The -week project included restoring the libraryrsquos original floors and creating a modern environment with new shelving and furniture. West Lothian Council member Dave King praised the project at its completion, saying it would ensure that the building ldquowill continue to be at the heart of the town for years to come.In a digital age of Apple and Google, do these projects mean we still need libraries. Another of Carnegiersquos legacy, the UK trust he set up in , think so. It commissioned a survey that found around half the population use public libraries, and of those users, two in five use the library at least once a month. Meanwhile, people are far more likely to say the library is important to their communitythan to themselves personally .The trust is also partnering in the development of Scotlandrsquos first national strategy for public libraries, and theyrsquore encourage innovation and public engagement through initiatives like the Carnegie Library Lab and Engaging Libraries.Carnegie funded over  libraries throughout the English-speaking world, including  in the UK and Ireland and almost  in the United States. Why did he do it  Carnegie spent his teenage years as a telegraph messenger boy, benefitting from access to a small library funded by a retired merchant. He believed this is what made him his fortune. As Carnegie wrote to an applicant for a library building: ldquoI believe that it outranks any other one thing a community can do to benefit its people.

Then you get closer, you can see the plants, the little insects and the birds. Sit quietly and spend time watching, and the birds just pop up from the ground and fly off.ldquoI grew up on the edge of the peatlands, at times it could be a dark place. The pools are several feet deepyou step off at certain parts itrsquos really boggy. Children and animals could be stuck. My friends were often warned not to go.The Flows she knows so well, are so northerly and remote that most Scotsndash unless they happen to fire up the car and join the tourists tackling the North Coast  route ndash will probably never see them with their own eyes.Yet they are on the verge of becoming listed alongside such global treasures as Australiarsquos Great Barrier Reef, Galapagos Islands and the Everglades in Florida as a Unesco World Heritage Site.A public consultation organised by the Peatlands Partnership, a multi-agency organisation committed to securing World Heritage Site status for the blanket bog, began this week, with a drop-in event in Wick the first of several.Ian Mitchell, Scottish Natural Heritage operations officer based at Golspie, said: ldquoBlanket bog globally is very rare, and Scotland has a very large proportion of the world quota of blanket bog. We need to try to keep it in very good condition to keep carbon locked in. World Heritage Site status would be an enormous benefit in terms of the Flow Country becoming a major attraction for visitors. It would put it in the same category as the Great Barrier Reef and the Pyramids. By promoting the Flow Country as a World Heritage Site, the benefits of tourism can be spread to other areas, so other communities can benefit.The Flow Country stretches across Caithness and Sutherland, a ,-acreexpanse of peat bog, lochs and bog pools that is more than twice the size of Orkney. It is Europersquos biggest blanket bog and regarded as the best example of its kind in the world.Up to  metresdeep, it holds an estimated  million tonnes of carbon, nearly twice as much as all the forests and woodlands in Great Britain.: What did the Romans ever do for us  And who were they anyway Its soggy terrain provides fresh water for streams that are home to otters and spawning salmon. The bog attracts common scoter ducks ndash one of the few places they are found ndash while red-throated,black-throated ers, golden plover and greenshank come to nest. Raptors such as merlin, short-eared owls and golden eagles hunt over the moss and in its pools, frogs, snakes, shrews and dozens of species of insects thrive.ldquoOne keyof the peatlands is the regulation of climate, says Dr Roxane Andersen, senior research fellow and co-ordinator of the Flow Country Research Hub at the University of the Highlands and Islandsrsquo Environmental Research Institute.ldquoThe peatland takes up carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. The conditions are cold and wet, carbon is turned to biomass and preserved as peat. Butyou start draining peatland, the carbon stored as peat is released much faster into the atmosphere.ldquoSo, in good condition, the blanket bog can mitigate climate change, but disturbing it will release carbon faster.Some fear it has already been subjected to pockets of damage. Red deer trample and graze on the delicate plants, the historic creation of farming drains has dried the soil and introducing forests has eroded stretches of the fragile landscape.Joe Perry, the Peatland Partnershiprsquos World Heritage Sitersquos project coordinator, says the fight to restore parts of the blanket bog and control fluctuating numbers of deer, is in hand.: great places to enjoy Scotlands peerless wildleHe said: ldquoThe deer are managed pretty well.

Enraged at the sight of tourists tucking into snacks on the steps of the cityrsquos Santa Croce Basilica, Mayor Dario Nardella has ordered street cleaners to hose them down.Announcing the measure last year, he said: ldquoIf tourists want to sit there, theyrsquoll get wet. Florence is full of cafes with outdoor seating, tables, and benches.

For example, anyone with a tendency towards public displays of affection may have to learn to keep their hands to themselves in the United Arab Emirates, where kissing, holding hands and hugging in public should be avoided.Stirling electrician Jamie Harron found to his cost that even brushing against someone could have dire consequences in Dubai, when he was thrown in jail alongside murderers after being accused of sexual assault two years ago.

Hersquos a fine lad, our Jack, with a grand sense of humour that is a first requirement of political leadership in Scotland, and Irsquom sure hersquos very popular among the sentient minority in the House of Lords.It was his call for a second chamber or Citizensrsquo Assembly in Scotland that created the headlines this week, with the idea being to create a body that allows the common peopleand councilsto query Holyrood legislation.Jack said that what he was seeking was a ldquobottom-up check, but I really think that should have remained a private matter between himself and his doctor.Essentially, he wants to create a sort of House of Lords, but without the big red gowns and daily vat of sherry. Rightly, he points out that formerly influential bodies like the Kirk and the STUC hardly get a look-in these days. Butwersquore going to fiddle about constitutionally with societyrsquos bottom, surely it should be we, the common people, that get to sit on our butts in a second assembly, and not a bunch of ministers with their heids in the clouds or trade unionists angling for more pay.We, the people, could be chosen by Lottery or nominated by popular acclaim. Ever since the electoral demise of the Socialists, Holyrood has suffered from a lack of scruffs whose purpose would be to keep the political elite in touch with actual non-suited and indeed unsuitable people at the sharp end of reality-style le.However, while it was this second chamber argument that drew the attention of a good three or four people, the revelation that got the populace cocking an ear trumpet involved Jack recounting the time that, when then Prime Minister Tony Blair was thinking of giving the troublesome Scots devolution, he invited the jaunty Jock down for a chat ndash and, before saying anything, offered him a glass of wine.According to Jack, this had never happened before, possibly because of the risk that it might start him singing.T Blair: ldquoSo, Jock, now that yoursquove inhaled your glass of wine, what do you think of my devolution proposal Jack stands up reverently, bows head, holds onion under eye and begins: ldquoIrsquom nobodyrsquos child hellipIn reality, Jack appears to have sipped suspiciously at the alcoholic beverage and said: ldquoAye, arsquoright. Drsquoyou have any dry roasted peanuts And thatrsquos how we got where we are today. Jack seems to think that the best thing the parlie ever did was institute a smoking ban but, in a way, that just kinda hints at the whole problem with the place.I know there was also the legislation against fox-mangling and in favour of gay marriage, but itrsquos still not the big economic or diplomatic stuff of statesmanship.ImagineJack had been leader of a country with full, proper powers. He could have gone about starting wars or stravaiging into the United Nations saying, ldquoAye, you shut up and ldquoCan we have a window open . Real influence in the world.Scotlandrsquos constitutional position remains unsatisfactory to everyone. ImagineTony Blair had offered Jack a huge dram and said: ldquoRight, Jock, Irsquove been thinking about this and have decided to give Scotland her complete and utter freedom.

Itrsquos not clear why this is. Certainly, we know that theyrsquore easily offended or triggered, and believe everything is about ldquofeelings, which are best avoided in my experience.Commentators have lambasted this lack of emotional restraint, urging millennials to adopt a stf upper lip.

Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"“But we know the impact it has on children meeting the veterans who make Scotland’s five million poppies every year and listening to their stories, as well as getting the chance to make their own poppy.“We wanted to take that experience on the road to school children and people across Scotland and so the idea for Bud was born.”Funding largely came from two sources – £, from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and £, from LIBOR funds. Bud was also supported by the Celtic FC Foundation, Edinburgh Trust No Account, First Bus, Gordon Fraser Charitable Trust, Neat Vehicles, PF Charitable Trust, The Basil Death Trust, The Murdoch Forrest Charitable Trust and the Welsh Family Trust.Then came a decision on which vehicle to use.Gordon said: “Our initial idea was a bus but we later decided a truck would be more accessible and flexible.“We spoke to Brakes, which delivers school meals – Bud is the same model as one of its  tonne trucks.“The contract then went out to tender and we teamed up with Neat Vehicles.“Their creative team turned Bud from a drawing into reality. Hydraulics are used so that he pops out and doubles in size, giving us ample space to tell our story.”Exhibits include historical artefacts, interactive displays and the moving stories of veterans and their families.Visitors also have the opportunity to make their own poppy using the same methods as the -stong team of veterans who work at the Poppy Factory.Guests are then invited to visit the Bud website to share their story of reflection and hope, which will create their own poppy “avatar” – a visual representation of what the poppy and remembrance means to them.“It’s an extension to our learning programme and online resources, which are downloaded free of charge by hundreds of teachers every year,” explained Gordon.“Bud is very hands on though – there are even hands guiding people to create their own poppies.“Four framed portraits also come to le to tell the poppy story – Lady Haig, a modern day volunteer collector, one of our current poppy factory workers and one from the early s.“Children and adults alike love it – it really helps to capture imaginations.“Four veterans, depicted as cartoon characters, also tell their stories and explain how Poppyscotland has helped them.“And the kids love using the clocking in machine – just like our workers use at the factory.“They’ll soon be able to buy Bud merchandise so they can take a small part of the experience with them too.”Seeing Bud come to le has been an incredible journey for Poppyscotland.Gordon added: “I was blown away with it the first time I saw it six weeks ago, even before its final fit out.“In our near -year history, it’s a unique project we can all be very proud of.“The public feedback has already been very positive, both from pupils at St Denis’s in Glasgow and with young football fans in Falkirk.“We also had a lady on crutches who was delighted to discover the lt on the back of the truck – Bud is fully accessible to all.“Now, we just want to get out on the road. “We hope spotting Bud will become an eye-spy game with people sharing it on social media at #poppybud.”Bud bookings now open but please be mindful of logistics!Donations raised from Bud’s tours across Scotland will fund Poppyscotland’s work, helping veterans year-round.The charity raised more than £ million from the poppy appeal last year, allowing it to deliver support to members of the Armed Forces community.While there will be no charge for Bud’s visits, there is an interactive donation box on the way out to raise funds. Louise Mackie, headteacher of St Denis’s Primary School, believes it will be a big hit.She said: “Being the first school to visit was a real honour and I’m sure thousands of other students and members of the public will find their Bud experience as moving and thought-provoking as we did.”Bookings will operate on a rolling three-month calendar with the charity aiming to book visits in neighbouring areas. Gordon explained: “If we’re going up to Aberdeenshire, we won’t be able to visit Peebles the following day. “Ideally we’d like to spend several days in the north-east, before then travelling down to the Borders or central belt. “Logistically, that will make it a lot easier for us but we’ll see how it works in practice!”To book Bud or access the supporting learning resources for teachers, visit the website poppybud.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"charity team come together for meeting","story":"Over  people from across Aberdeenshire joined together for a charity gathering recently.Members of staff, board members and volunteers met at CLAN House, CLAN’s head office in Aberdeen, for its bi-annual meeting and for a day of learning and friendship.Staff members and volunteers travelled from Shetland, Orkney, Elgin, Banchory, Ballater, Moray, Inverurie, Turrf and Crimond to hear the charity’s latest news and learn about new initiatives.At the event, CLAN CEO Dr Colette Backwell shared the latest CLAN achievements, identying that the charity supported , people in , almost half of which were new clients, including  new clients who were supported by the children and families’ team.Staff members also shared the latest news from the charity’s centres across the north-east, enabling the whole team to learn from each other.Anne Marie Robson a support volunteer for CLAN commented: “The gathering is a great opportunity to get to know everybody and to understand the overall picture.“It’s nice to feel involved – it makes you feel even more passionate about what CLAN does.”CLAN CEO Dr Colette Backwell said: “It is important that the CLAN team gathers together when we can, not just to hear the latest news but also to share good practice and learn from successful initiatives happening in our shops and centres.“CLAN supports , people every year, and each client has dferent requirements, so it is vital that our team works together to identy the best type of support.“CLAN’s services in the community, at our centres and outreach facilities, are vital as people undergoing cancer treatment may not be able to travel far, so we work hard to reach as many areas as we can, bringing professional, caring support to those who need it most.”The CLAN gathering takes place twice a year enabling those working in outlying areas to meet with their team members and gain a greater understanding of the achievements of CLAN as a whole.CLAN supports those who have a cancer diagnosis across the north east, Moray, Orkney and Shetland, as well as their friends and family members.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..!

We have also worked with other folk in the community.#They have thoroughly enjoyed the project. It has been a really rich learning experience for them — they have enjoyed meeting dferent folk in the community and I think that#s a really valuable way to learn.#Pupils Charlie Scottand Connor MacKenziespoke about their favourite parts of the project.#I quite liked doing all the research, and having Sandy Firth come in to tell us stories,# said Connor.Charlie added: #I really enjoyed going to Radio Orkney and when Sandy Firth came in too.#Both said they were also looking forward to taking their book and its stories on tour to some of Orkney#s residential care homes. This is the second year that Britt Harcus has helped guide this KTHI project. She took the opportunity to thank those who had helped make it possible.#The KTHI need a big thank you for their funding,# she said.#Without them, this project would simply not have happened. #Sandy Firth, who came to visit the bairns and has been a great source of knowledge and inspiration for the class. I think it#s important that wartime stories and memories are passed on and not forgotten.#Kim and Robert Foden also deserve a special mention for their help in this project as well as Dave Gray at Radio Orkney.

It is an information gathering and assessment exercise which helps stakeholders, the public and the planning authority understand the potential environmental impacts of major development proposals.The Orkney Community Wind Farm Project could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney, say the council.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The scoping report for Faray is available at here. The scoping report for Quanterness is available at here.Councillor James Stockan is leader of Orkney Islands Council. He said: “We are keen to keep the public informed on this project as it develops. Our well-attended consultation events were very useful, and allowed a range of views and opinions to be expressed and we’re looking forward to carrying out a further event in Westray in June.#Once all the information events are complete, we’ll be looking to provide more online information on the project and in the meantime I’d encourage folk to take a look at the scoping reports for detailed information.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These concerns have not been adequately addressed,” wrote Mr McNairney. “The plan does not properly acknowledge and address the region’s infrastructure constraints ... for delivering housing land across the area.”: The danger Edinburgh council poses to economic growth – John McLellanThis is the same Scottish Government which agreed the £.bn Edinburgh Region City Deal with the councils, which is supposed to be the driving force behind growth, marrying up major housing, infrastructure and economy projects. So the Scottish Government has not only been in the middle of the planning process but has been instrumental in providing the building blocks too.It was plain from the moment the City Deal projects were announced that rather than a grand plan it was more about councils grabbing what they could for their pet projects. For example, the Scottish Government helped sign off , new homes around Winchburgh in a scheme which pays little heed to where the occupants will work or how they get there.It’s a bit rich for the Scottish Government to pin all the blame on councils when it is just as culpable for the mess and the minister responsible, Kevin Stewart, has some explaining to do. The SNP at both Holyrood and Westminster never misses an opportunity to condemn the UK government for mishandling Brexit asthe unpicking of a -year international alliance by a minority administration was ever going to be easy. But even with the SNP controlling both the main local authority and the National government, after five years it has failed to steer through a regional planning framework.Without a joined-up plan for the region, Fe, East Lothian and Midlothian councils can carry on granting planning applications for new housing estates without concerning themselves too much about the implications for travel in Edinburgh. And Edinburgh can carry on making le dficult for developers who will get their schemes through on appeal because there is no agreed plan to guide them. Planning consultants will now be telling their clients to pile in.Sesplan won’t get the attention Brexit commands, but it’s every bit as shambolic and the direct implications on the Edinburgh region every bit as serious.Consider no-beal Brexit effect on UnionLocal planning wasn’t high on the agenda on Craigentinny doorsteps this week and neither was next week’s European election, butany of the No-Dealers at Nigel Farage’s Edinburgh event are tempted to believe Brexit will have little impact on the way previously strong Unionists view the UK they might want to think again. The interest and turnout might be low on Thursday but, on the question of Scottish independence, the sht from a firm No two years ago to “Wait and See” was not uncommon. That could give heart to Nationalists were it not for “Wait and See” being equally applicable to holding another referendum any time soon.

But the money tree has stopped growing, unlike demand and political pressure, and in the live-streaming digital age the audience is no longer captive.A lunch in Edinburgh this week for, in ghastly bureaucrat-speak, BBC stakeholders heard more about the threat posed by the UK government’s decision to hand responsibility for free licenses for over-s to the Corporation, whichfully funded will cost £m and hammer the programming budget.The BBC is bemused that the rest of the media world isn’t swinging in behind their campaign, but no other media company was such a beneficiary of ex-Chancellor Gordon Brown’s largesse when he introduced the concession in . No organisation would be happy at the prospect of either finding £m or taking away a long-standing benefit for key customers and had Mr Brown given every over- a £ news voucher to spend on their favourite publications then perhaps there would be more sympathy.But he didn’t, and like everyone  in dficult and fast-changing media markets the BBC must make tough choices. Rather than attack the Government, the BBC would be better advised to back the campaign to challenge the all-consuming media monopolies like Google and Facebook which are sucking a lot more than £m out of the UK’s £bn digital advertising market.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit jeremy corbyn pulls labour out of cross party talks","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Labour leader said his party would consider any further proposals from the government seriously, but told Theresa May in a letter than talks had ldquogone as far as they can.It comes as a leaked memo from the Labour-Tory discussions suggested a series of indicative votes on a customs union relationship between the UK and EU could take place next week, although Labour sources said the party had not signed up to the plan.: Brexit: Pressure mounts on Theresa May over June vote as Boris Johnson confirms leadership plans bidThe government has said it will bring forward legislation to implement Brexit at the start of June, whether or not there is a deal with Labour.Both parties are suffering in polling ahead of next weeks European elections, with the latest survey putting Labour in third and the Tories in fth as Nigel Farages Brexit Party builds a commanding lead and the Liberal Democrats and Greens pick up pro-EU votes.ldquoI am writing to let you know that I believe the talks between us about finding a compromise agreement on leaving the European Union have now gone as far as they can, Mr Corbyn wrote to the Prime Minister on Friday morning.He said the talks had been ldquoconducted in good faith on both sides and were ldquodetailed, constructive and have involved considerable effort for both our teams.ldquoHowever, it has become clear that, while there are some areas where compromise has been possible, we have been unable to bridge important policy gaps between us, he went on.ldquoEven more crucially, the increasing weakness and instability of your government means there cannot be confidence in securing whatever might be agreed between us.Mr Corbyn said there was ldquogrowing concern on the Labour benches ldquoabout the governments ability to deliver on any compromise agreement.The Labour leader said: ldquoAs you have been setting out your decision to stand down and Cabinet ministers are competing to succeed you, the position of the government has become ever more unstable and its authority eroded.ldquoNot infrequently, proposals by your negotiating team have been publicly contradicted by statements from other members of the Cabinet.: Brexit: Top Labour candidate says staying in the EU is non-negotiableldquoIn recent days we have heard senior Cabinet ministers reject any form of customs union, regardless of proposals made by government negotiators.Mr Corbyn concluded that it was ldquoonly right that the Government now wishes again to test the will of Parliament and said Labour would ldquocarefully consider any proposals the Government wishes to bring forward to break the Brexit deadlock.ldquoHowever, I should reiterate that, without signicant changes, we will continue to oppose the Governments deal as we do not believe it safeguards jobs, living standards and manufacturing industry in Britain, he said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll tories and labour set for eu election wipeout in scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A YouGov survey put the Tories in fth place, with the Liberal Democrats pushing Labour into third.window.twttr : Brexit: Top Labour candidate says staying in the EU is non-negotiableNigel Faragersquos Brexit Party is on course to secure more than a third of the vote, and is now predicted to win two MEPs in Scotland, meaning that Labour and the Conservatives could both be squeezed out entirely.Across the UK, the YouGov poll puts the Brexit Party on %, the Lib Dems on %, Labour on %, the Greens on % and the Tories on %.Only % of Labour voters at the general election, and just % of Conservative voters in , told pollsters they intend to vote for those parties again next week.Seat projections based on the figures suggested the Brexit Party would secure  MEPs, compared to the  won by UKIP in .The Lib Dems would pick up nine MEPs, putting them on  Labourrsquos group in the European Parliament would be cut in half, down to  MEPs the Greens would gain five MEPs, putting them on eight and the Tories would lose  seats, falling to just five across the UK.: Brexit: Jeremy Corbyn pulls Labour out of cross-party talksIn Scotland, the SNP are set to gain another MEP, putting them on three.

As we face into the new mandate it is high time to effectively deliver on the long-promised aspiration of Belfast as a ‘Diverse City of Equals’.The Gaeltacht Quarter Board has long engaged with Council but Council has failed, thus far, to break down the reluctance of some to embrace and promote the Gaeltacht Quarter as one of the vibrant, open and welcoming quarters of the city and as an asset for residents and tourists alike. Given the make-up of the new Council we would hope to see progress in this regard. Here are some points we would like you to consider.# Unionists are now the smallest combined voting block in Council# Unionists can only muster  votes# That is  votes short of a majority# Unionists can no longer block the aspiration for Belfast as a Diverse City of Equals# No-one now needs to do deals with unionists in Belfast to deliver for citizens in a non-partisan way# Parties can now develop and promote fair and equitable policies, which are Section  compliant, without needing to seek unionist approval or unionist votes# Parties can garner working majorities without allowing Alliance to play the role of arbiter# The combined Alliance and unionist vote is , two votes short of a majority# If parties continuedoing deals with unionism they must explainit is to deliver on voters’ aspirations or for other more expedient reasons.Combined Non-Unionist Strength with Alliance –  votes.Sinn Féin Alliance SDLP Greens People Before Profit Combined Non-Unionist Strength without Alliance  votes.Sinn Féin SDLP Greens People Before Profit "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"christopher looks to the future at newington cu","story":"HAVING studied drama at Queen’s University, a younger Christopher McBride could hardly have imagined he would one day become a Director at Newington Credit Union.However, the -year-old accountant’s thespian ambitions exited the stage when he realised he “couldn’t do accents”. He good-humouredly reflects on his lack of accomplishment in that department as a skill he “kind of needed” to carve out a career in drama. Luckily, he has found both fulfilment and success not only in his day job in the finance industry, but also through his work at the local credit union.Christopher has been a lelong member of Newington Credit Union, which was founded in  by his grandfather, Sean Caughey. Since coming on board as a Director in December , Christopher has striven to make a dference in the local community like his grandfather before him.“My granddad founded the credit union so that the local community would have somewhere they could save money, where everyone could pool together their resources so thatpeople needed a loan then there would be that central community hub that they could use and that’s something we’re doing to this very day,” he said.“I feel the credit union is really important. When I was in England I spoke to people about the credit union model and they were amazed because they don’t have the same focus on credit unions.In the last few years we’ve seen the controversy theresurrounding payday loan companies with massive interest rates, but that might not have happenedthere were credit unions. People who would otherwise have gone to a payday lender can come to the credit union and get a rate where they won’t be exploited, which is very important. I wanted to be able to help the credit union by using my expertise in accountancy to help its development.“I’ve been involved with the monthly meetings where we look at how the credit union is progressing. It’s really to make sure that we are continuing to serve our purpose. I have started to get involved in the investment committee to look at what we are doing with our money. I’m also involved in trying to get more people to join the credit union. For me, it’s very important to get more people – especially young people – involved in the credit union.”During his short time as a Newington Credit Union Director, Christopher has overseen an upsurge in members following a highly successful recruitment drive in March – something he says he is “very proud of”. He is also spearheading the credit union’s efforts to bring in a erse range of volunteers to help develop the organisation.“I want to get more Directors on board,” he said. “I’m one of the younger directors on the board, so I want to get more people my age involved. It’s good to have people from a range of backgrounds and it’s a good way to get involved with the local community. I really wanted to improve the North Belfast area, it’s something that I’m quite passionate about, so getting on board has really helped me do that. A lot of people think thatthey don’t have a financial or business background that they can’t get involved, but that’s not the case.“I came from a drama background and became a director, so the only real qualication is that you want to help develop the Credit Union and the local community.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"church leaders meet stormont politicians","story":"LEADERS of the Catholic, Presbyterian, Anglican and Methodist churches in Ireland have held talks with Stormont parties in the latest attempt to break the political deadlock.British and Irish Ministers including Secretary of State Karen Bradley also attended the meeting on Tuesday.The delegation of church leaders told the Stormont parties it was time to demonstrate courageous political leadership.Archbishop Richard Clarke said: #One of the messages we tried to send today is that in a vacuum, other forces will move into that vacuum and take control of it.#And for that reason, there is this absolutely huge need to ensure that somehow, normal political le starts again.#Archbishop Eamon Martin added, “If we don’t sit around the table and talk, then what  ”Following the meeting, Sinn Féin leader in the north Michelle O’Neill said: “All of society has a stake in this process so we very much welcome the start of a broad engagement with wider society beginning with the church leaders that were at Stormont today and we thank them for their contribution.“We want to meet with a wide range of civic society, all the churches, the trade unions, business organisations, womens groups, language groups, the community and voluntary sector and everyone out there because this process and these institutions belong to us all.“These talks have the potential to restore the power-sharing institutions and that is the best way to ensure that the next generation benefits from the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process.“We all know what the outstanding issues are. We believe they can and must be resolved so Sinn Féin will continue to engage in these talks with positivity and a determination to do the business.“None of the issues are insurmountable or unresolvable. Agreement can be reached and the institutions restored with the positive political will and support of all parties and both governments.“The way forward is through implementation of agreements already made, safeguarding rights enjoyed by citizens in the rest of Ireland and in Britain, and delivering good governance.”DUP leader Arlene Foster added, “Getting the Assembly back up and running immediately would be a courageous thing to do, a compassionate thing to do and the right thing to do.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"eastwood optimistic at taking third euro seat","story":"SDLP leader Colum Eastwood says his party are in the “best position” to take a seat in the European Parliament.There are  candidates battling for seats in the north with sitting MEPs Sinn Féin’s Martina Anderson and DUP’s Diane Dodds expected to win a seat following next Thursday’s election.A LuicdTalk poll, published by The Times, has predicted that Mr Eastwood would received more first preference votes than the UUP and Alliance in the fight for the final seat. On a visit to Lisburn’s city centre-based Atlas Women’s Centre, which is EU funded, Colum Eastwood told Daily Belfast that his party are “clearly in the best position to take that seat.”“We have had a fantastic response. We’ve set out to run a very positive pro-European anti-Brexit campaign because I think we have the most credibility in terms of being opposed to Brexit, opposed to the referendum happening. “We are unequivocal in our opposition to it. We think there is an opportunity to now send a very positive pro- European anti-Brexit message by electing two Remain MEPs and we think that’s key becausewe elected two Leavers that would be sending the wrong message as to what people in Northern Ireland think about Brexit.“It’s within our grasp. The was a poll a few weeks ago which had us in fourth position, there was a poll two days ago which put us in third position so out of all the good Remain candidates were are clearly in the best position to take that seat,” he said.He continued: “We want people to lend us their support, even just for this one election, to send a clear anti-Brexit message. People voted in  to Remain,  per cent. I think that numberit was tested again would be through the roof. People have watched the Brexit process unfold with horror they are deeply concerned about the impact it is going to have here, on our economy, our society, our peace process. People do not want to go backwards.“We are trying to take John Hume’s seat back and I think we can do it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sdlp condemn flying of parachute regiment flag","story":"SDLP MLA Pat Catney says he is working with both the PSNI and Department for Infrastructurein a bid to remove a Parachute Regiment flag from the Thaxton Village roundabout in Lisburn.The erection of the contentious flag comes after several were previously flown in parts of North Belfast at the junction of the Oldpark Road and Ballysilian Road. It is understood the flags were put up to show ‘solidarity’ with ‘Soldier F’ who faces prosecution over the killings of two people on Bloody Sunday in . It comes at a time when the Ballymurphy Massacre inquest is taking place,  years after the Parachute Regiment killed  people in West Belfast in August .Mr Catney said that both agencies have responded to him “and I will continue to liaise with the Department and the PSNI to get this matter resolved”.“The whole flags question is a political issue which can be resolved through the Flags Commission and the SDLP will also put this issue on the talks agenda.“The soldier in question must be subject to the due process of the law and banners of support, like statements of condemnation, will not advance the cause of justice or address the anxiety of the families in any way.“We are trying and working to build a shared community here, we are working for good relations. We can do without such flags and banners in Lisburn.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tuckers bakery and deli a new gaeltacht quarter go to","story":"SITUATED in the heart of Belfast’s vibrant Gaeltacht Quarter, Tuckers Bakery and Deli could hardly be better located. This busy stretch of the Falls Road has no shortage of eateries and past experience has shown that it takes real quality to last there but, luckily, quality is something Tuckers has in abundance.The Gaeltacht Quarter is a hive of business activity and is also home to St Mary’s University College, so a good rule of thumb when choosing somewhere to dine during office hours is to follow the local workforce and students. When my colleagues and I visited Tuckers at lunchtime on Thursday it was bustling with precisely that type of clientele. Having already tried one of their impressive sausage rolls during a passing visit on one Saturday morning, I had already planned ato sample some more of the items on their enticing menu.Upon entering, we were shown to our table by our waitress Nicola, who also happens to head up the business alongside her partner, Dale. The interior of Tuckers is brightly decorated giving it a casual and laidback feel. Illustrations and sketches from local artist Joseph McGuinness also adorn the walls – an enjoyable touch that was admired during our visit.Since this was my first proper Tuckers experience, I felt that having a go at the fry was essential. Universally adored, the fry is the staple of most good café’s and Tuckers did not disappoint. Simply billed as the full Irish fry, this sizeable offering had all the hallmarks of a classic. Two slices of thick-cut bacon, two quality butcher style pork sausages, fresh vegetable roll, black and white pudding and a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg were served alongside the usual trimmings as well as a welcome hash brown. Given its sheer proportions, this fry is not for the faint hearted, however, with each bite as good as the first, I had no problem finishing it off.Across the table, my colleague opted for the burger, which was served with nicely seasoned and crisp French fries. While I was obliged in tasting a few of the fries, my colleague was unlikely to part with any piece of his burger. Served in a soft floury bun, the burger was expertly cooked – seared on the outside and moist on the inside.A no-nonsense club sandwich made up the rest of the order fresh ingredients properly assembled and served with a generous portion of fries.After washing everything down with several cups of tea, we left Tuckers feeling full and satisfied. The friendly service and wide range of excellent mains, sandwiches, pastries and deli items would be reason enough for anyone to pay this local gem a visit. Despite having opened its doors just six months ago, Tuckers has already established itself as a firm favourite on the Falls Road. My colleagues and I fully intend toin the near future, and I have already promised myself another fry at the very least.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

The fate of the third seat, held by the retiring Ulster Unionist Jim Nicholson, is less certain.Speaking at the launch of the Alliance manesto at the CIYMS sports grounds in east Belfast yesterday, Mrs Long said her party is best placed to take that seat.The party manesto includes pledges to secure a peoples vote, keep borders open, protect the economy and support the work of the EU.Mrs Long said: \"The recent council election results, in addition with a number of polls and surveys, show Alliance is in prime position to not only substantially increase our number of first preference votes but also gain the required transfers from others to take the third seat and show the EU, and indeed the world, Northern Ireland wants to Remain.\"Brexit is not an orange or green issue and I am not an orange or green politician.\"In , people right across our community came together to vote Remain. I believe we can achieve better together and show that same spirit again on May .\"Mrs Long said she believes Northern Irelands third seat is going to come down to transfers, and urged voters totwo Remain candidates.\"In the recent polls that have been produced, we are literally within the margin of error, neck-and-neck with the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP,\" she said.\"The Ulster Unionists are the current incumbent, and its very clearwe are neck-and-neck with the current incumbent, we are in contention for that seat.\"Unlike the Ulster Unionists who are moving backwards, and the SDLP who have been drting backwards, we have forward momentum, so the opportunity is there for us to attract crucial transfers because that is what will decide the last seat, not just the first preference votes but how many transfers we can draw from across the board,\" she said.\"Thats why I am encouraging people who vote Alliance to vote for other pro-remain candidates after they have voted Alliance number one, and I would hope that other pro-Remain candidates will want to do the same.\"Its important we have two voices in Europe who are pro-Remain, who are making a strong statement to government about how Northern Ireland feels about the EU,\" the Alliance leader said.\"But I believe it is also important that we have a voice there that is not simply a unionist or nationalist voice, that doesnt further polarise this issue but that can represent the broad swathe of public opinion and civic society. And I believe I am best placed to do that.\"Alliance’s key manesto prioritiesReinforcing progressive values. Alliance said it believes in “strength through ersity, respecting people, enabling opportunities, protecting rights and inclusion”.Supporting work of the EU. The manesto states Northern Ireland’s participation in the EU brings huge advantages.Protecting our economy. It says the Customs Union and Single Market “provide massive economic opportunities to our manufacturing, agri-food and service sectors”.Keeping open borders. Alliance believes any form of Brexit risks new isions and barriers, adding: “We must keep the open borders throughout these islands, and preserve everyone’s freedom to trade and live their lives freely.” Securing a people’s vote. Alliance wants a fresh referendum, with Remain on the ballot.

securing the support of her erstwhile parliamentary allies for her Withdrawal Agreement.I am disappointed that those who have been loud opponents to a hard border on the island fall silent when it comes to the prospect of a hard border in the Irish SeaDanny KennedyUnionists are concerned the backstop insurance policy keeping Northern Ireland’s regulations in line with the Republic’s could

it comes to the prospect of a hard border in the Irish Sea.“Unionist concerns around the backstop are just as valid and are afforded equal protection under the Good Friday Agreement as those of our nationalist neighbours about a hard land border.”The former minister in the Stormont Executive said the two-and-a-half year absence of devolved powersharing at Stormont was also a major issue on the doorsteps.Veteran Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson is retiring.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said: “This election is about who you want to represent you in Brussels now, not a re-run of a vote

The film tells the story of -year-olds, Conchita Gonzalez, Jacinta Gonzalez, and Maria Loli Mazon and -year-old Maria Cruz Gonzalez, who were all from poor families living in San Sebastian de Garabandal, in the Santander Province, and who had been playing together on the outskirts of the town on the evening of June , , when they claim that they heard a loud noise and saw the bright figure of St Michael the Archangel.They said that the Archangel appeared to them again, in the same place, in the days that followed, announcing to them that they would see Our Lady on July . After this first encounter, the girls claimed to have over , visits from Our Lady of Mount Carmel, referred to as such because the girls said that her appearance and dress looked like portrayals of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.The film also portrays the struggle that the village’s parish priest, Fr Valentin, and Civil Guard brigadier, Mr Juan Alez Seco found themselves in to find out the truth, while confronting a perplexed hierarchy and facing an ever growing multitude of people arriving at the village in search of answers.The girls reported that the purpose of the visitations was to call for a “conversion of heart”, and that they had received two messages, one on October , , directly from Our Lady and the other via St Michael on June , . The visionaries also claimed that Our Lady had told them of a “warning”, a “miracle” and a “punishment”,the call to conversion was not heeded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe warning is described as a momentary stopping of time around the world, with all people then seeing the spiritual condition of their souls, and how they should amend their ways. Within a year of this, it is reported that the miracle will take place, which will leave a permanent sign in Garabandal – one that can be seen and photographed, but not touched. While the reported apparitions have not been approved by the Church, authorities maintain a conservative attitude towards them. In accordance with usual procedure concerning claimed visitations, the local bishop has primary jurisdiction. Past practice regarding approved apparitions indicates that in the absence of clear supernatural proof, neither the local bishop nor Rome is likely to approve an apparition.Following two committees convened by the bishops of Santander, they declared that there were no phenomena capable of authenticating the facts as undoubtedly supernatural, but they did not condemn the message. The first commission stated: “We find nothing in need of ecclesiastical censure or condemnation, neither in the doctrine nor in the spiritual recommendations supposedly addressed to the faithful.” On his retirement, Bishop Juan Antonio del Val, who called the second commission, stated that “the message of Garabandal was important and theologically correct”.Brunswick Cinebowl is located at Brunswick Lane, Pennyburn Industrial Estate, Derry.

It is the exact opposite of the core republican values of equality and fraternity.”The Ulster University report contends that a specic government department is set up to deal with the issue because both religious and political sectarianism ‘shows no signs of going away’.Other suggestions made in the report called ‘Sectarianism in Northern Ireland: A Review’, include lowering the voting age to  and creating an anthem for all sports.The report was compiled by Professor Duncan Morrow in conjunction with members of the Sir George Quigley Fund Committee.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe report writers spoke to a range of representatives from sectors including business, education, government, the community and voluntary sector and religious institutions.Declan Kearney continued: \"At our Ard Fheis in June  Sinn Féin adopted as policy One Community - Tackling the scourge of sectarianism in Irish society’ - which proposes a number of measures to tackle sectarianism.\"This policy framework made a number of recommendations including: The incorporation of a citizens’ anti-sectarian charter into the pledges of office for all elected representatives The introduction of a clear legal definition of sectarianism as a hate crime in legislation and with approporiate legally enforced sanctions and the establishment of a civic forum in the north as a  to encourage cross-community and anti -ectarian solidarity within civic society.\"Sinn Féin has also tabled anti sectarianism measures during all successive talks processes in recent years.\"I welcome the report from the University of Ulster as an important contribution to the debate on how to remove sectarianism from our society and political process.\"Sectarianism will not be wished away.

Ms McKee was shot dead on  April last by a masked New IRA gunman as she reported on ongoing riots in the Creggan area.Ruddys tribute has been recognised by the late Ms McKee’s partner, Sara Canning, who was extremely touched by his homage to the woman who was to become her we.Speaking to Derry News yesterday, Ruddy said: “It was so sad but I didnt realise just how sad until I heard more about Lyra on Jeremy Vine. That is when I knew I had to do something. I never expected it would lead to talking to Sara but it was so emotional. Just doing the pic was tearful but the reaction was very touching.“I am not sure I will ever understand. We are all humans and a mutual respect is what we should all strive and hope for.”When Ruddy first posted the piece on Facebook the week after Ms McKee’s murder, he said: “I know I have other pieces but had to do this one after hearing all about Lyra McKee on the the Jeremy Vine Show. Was crying for the whole piece. What an amazing woman.”Ruddy then asked on the Facebook post what words he should add to artwork and the most requested response was #notinmyname.Ms Canning saw and appreciated the artwork and thanked Ruddy for featuring Ms McKee.In a Facebook exchange, she wrote: “Fantastic. So powerful... she’d be so embarrassed but secretly massively pleased. It’s beautul, like her.”Ruddy replied: “Thank you so much. All of my thoughts are with you. I wish I had known about Lyra sooner. It hasnt until I heard more on Radio  that I found out just how amazing she was.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe poignant exchange continued with Ms Canning saying: “Thank you so much. This is a gorgeous piece ofart and it captures the beauty and the light of my Lyra.”To which Ruddy replied: “My absolute pleasure. You must have been such an amazing partnership. The words I have heard have been so swollen with love.”Meanwhile, Derry will remember the talented journalist a month after she was shot dead on the streets of Creggan as her friends and family vow they \"won’t let her memory and name dissolve.\"A Month’s Mind Mass will be held tonight in St Mary’s Chapel, Creggan, at .pm celebrated by Fr Joseph Gormley, the priest who gave the - year-old the Last Rites on the night she was shot dead. It will be followed by \"Love for Lyra,\" a gathering at the Peace Flame at .pm, in the Peace Garden adjacent to the Guildhall.Kathleen Bradley, a close friend of Ms McKee, said the Mass and public event would allow people to honour and remember her friend in an inclusive, religious and non-religious way.“We arranged a Month’s Mind Mass and the Love for Lyra event because it’s all still a shock to us and we know that it’s still a shock to the wider public,” she said.“Everyone is still grieving for Lyra, even people that didn’t know her ,and we are very conscious of others needing some kind of outlet to show that grief and support for Sara and Lyra’s family. So, we decided to have the Mass and a non-religious event.”Ms Bradley said that another reason for organising public events was to keep the profile of what happened to her dear friend a priority so that her murderer will be brought to justice.“It’s been a month and, while it is great that there have been arrests, Lyra’s murderer still hasn’t been arrested,” she said.\"We won’t let what happened to Lyra die out she’s too important and we won’t let her memory and name dissolve.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sold out over 200 set to compete in montgomery canal triathlon","story":"Victoria Anderson and Harriet Turner from Shropshire during the Montgomery Canalltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt triathlon on Saturdltspan classtruncate-full-screengtay, May , .Pic: Mike Sheridan County TimesMS-lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Sold out!

His lofted delivery carved out an opening for Mark McGuigan and he made no mistake with a clinical finish past a helpless Stephen Keith.This strike was an action replay of Derryrsquos first goal in the second minute when McGuigan picked out OrsquoDoherty and he too found the net with a classy finish.Shortly after Derryrsquos opening goal, Eoghan Sands swooped to level the scores at - apiece with a typically predatory strike, but that was as good as it got for Down.OrsquoDoherty continued to hurt Down with his accuracy. He was already on - when his rsquo dipped under the Down bar for a soft goal in the th minute and he went in at the break with - beside his name and a win almost guaranteed for his team.During the second half Oisin MacManus tapped over seven frees, but missed a couple of others and his Liatroim club mate Ruairiacute McCrickard found the net from a m free in the th minute.There was never a sense that Down were capable of bridging the ten-point gap at the interval as OrsquoDoherty and the McGuigans continued to pick off long range scores for Derry to put them in pole position in the group.Derry manager John McAvoy disclosed afterwards that it was a conscious decision to play into the breeze.ldquoWe wanted to play into the breeze as we felt that we would be more adjusted to it by the second half.ldquoYes, I was very pleased with the way the first half went. We used possession very well and drove on, he saidldquoIt wasnrsquot a perfect performance, but it was a good performance and itrsquos good to get it at the start of a competition. The red card made us work that bit harder and we had two or three with niggling injuries and then Thomas Brady was on a yellow card. So we used our subs and overall I have to be happy enough with today.Down boss Roacutenaacuten Sheehan wasnrsquot offering any excuses.ldquoWe conceded two softish goals in the first ten minutes and then, to be honest, we hit too many wides ndash  in total and eight from frees. I donrsquot think they missed any from frees.ldquoWe have a young team and when you concede goals like we did today, it knocks the confidence. Look we have to lt ourselves for next week and hope that our free-taking is a bit better, he said.ldquoBut Derry deserved to win, their movement was good.

They hope councillors will overrule this decision and agree to meet with them to hear their views.Local authority officials have previously insisted that officers from the the Commissioner of Irish Lights will be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority says this is to ensure that information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future before any plans are finalised.However, campaigners say they are at a complete loss to understand why they are being refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors given that the local authority has already given its unanimous backing to a motion calling for the beam to be retained.A spokeswoman for the campaign group said while they want to meet with councillors, the local authority insists that requests for public consultations on plans for St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse would be best addressed by the Commissioner of Irish Lights.ldquoThe council just doesnrsquot get it, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoWe recognise that meeting with the Commissioners is important, but we want to meet with councillors, the people we and many others recently elected into office.ldquoThe Commissioners have already met with the councillors which is what we want to do. But we are being denied the opportunity.The spokeswoman said campaigners have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue which they would like to discuss with councillors who are charged with instructing local authority officials what to do.ldquoIt could be argued we are being fobbed off on this particular issue and we cannot understand why. All we are asking is to meet with councillors to outline our concerns about the future of the sweeping beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The press and public were excluded from a recent meeting mdash described as a workshop mdash involving councillors and representatives from the Commissionerrsquos office, including its most senior official, Captain Robert McCabe, to discuss the future of the sweeping beam.Campaigners say that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the issue, they should also be permitted an opportunity to meet with elected representatives.ldquoCouncillors have had an opportunity to hear from the Commissioners which is only right and proper. All we are asking for is the same courtesy to be extended to the Lecale Lightkeepers. What is the problem ldquoThe subsequent report from the workshop involving the Commissioners and councillors was just two and a half lines and how can this possibly reflect the discussions that took place  All we are asking for is an opportunity to put our case and hope the councillors will ensure that this happens.The spokeswoman said while it is the councilrsquos view that a joint DEA meeting to put questions directly to representatives of the Commissioners of Irish Lights is the best way to address the issues they have raised, she contended officials are missing the point.She added: ldquoWe are seeking a meeting with all  councillors so they are acutely aware of our concerns.ldquoIf we are denied the opportunity of making a presentation to them, how are councillors supposed to know our view and the implications of losing the beam which has been part and parcel of the arearsquos maritime heritage for generations .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murdock helps Down to victory over Fermanagh  ","story":"AN electrying first half display enabled Down to get the better of Fermanagh in Brewster Park, Enniskillen, on Saturday evening.Victory now sets up Down with a mouthwatering Ulster MFC quarter-final confrontation with Tyrone at Pairc Esler on Sunday mdash a suitable curtain-raiser for the Down v Armagh SFC clash.Down went into the break with a commanding - to - lead, but they showed great composure and resilience to hold off a brave Fermanagh fightback, before emerging four point winners.Burrenrsquos Odhran Murdock converted an early free to settle the nerves before Conor Burns quickly brought the sides level in the third minute with a point from play.Murdock, who was prominent alongside Peter McEvoy in the middle of the park, lofted over a fth minute point to put Down back in the driving seat and three minutes later John McGovern stunned the hosts when he found the back of the Fermanagh net with an unerring finish.Cian McLoughlin and Adam Crimmins tagged on points as Down stormed into a - to - lead after only  minutes, but Rhys Campbell kept Fermanagh interested with his sidersquos second point.Unanswered points from Murdock, Oran Cunningham and Sean Og McCusker eased the visitors into a - to - lead by the th minute and at this stage of the game, Fermanagh were on the ropes.As the half drew to a close, Micheal Glynn and McCusker exchanged scores as Down went in with a - to - lead.Fermanagh certainly tightened things up in the second half and this gave them the confidence to play a more expansive style.Points from Aaron Jones and Glynn cut the arrears to six points within three minutes of the restart, but their comeback was halted by a good score from Down half forward Padraig Clancy.The home side went for broke mdash they had to mdash and the tactic paid off with three consecutive scores from the prolic Glynn to leave four points between the sides, - to - midway through the second half.Down had to dig deep, but they werenrsquot found wanting on this occasion and points from Josh Gray and Murdock extended the lead back out to six points with just less than  minutes remaining.Fermanagh werenrsquot finished just yet and points from Aodhan Durnien, Conor Burns and Glynn left a kick of the ball in it, but as the home side sought the equaliser, McCusker stole away to loft over Downrsquos insurance score and secure a deserved Downwin.Fermanagh: Fergal Quinn, Rhys Campbell , Josh Horan, Aaron Jones , Fionan OrsquoBrien, Oliver Hughes-Jordan, Diarmaid King, Conor Murphy, Conor Burns , Robbie McKenna, Micheal Glynn , Ronan McGovern, Enda McCabe, Conor Courtney, Eimhin Curry.

However, all three are capable of handling the big occasion and they could well form the basis of the Down defence.In attack, Down should have Glasdrummanrsquos Connaire Harrison fully fit again and his partnership with Burrenrsquos Donal OrsquoHare is central to Tallyrsquos aspirations.This duo have the ability to unlock any defence and the task of supplying them with good ball could fall to McKernan, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin and brothers Jerome and Ryan Johnston, and Clonduffrsquos Barry OrsquoHagan.Kieran McGeeney, now in his fth year in charge at Armagh, was able to get Armagh to hold their own in Division , but the Orchard County, although doing well in the Qualiers, have yet to win a game in Ulster under their former captain.Theof Stefan Campbell and Jamie Clarke this season and Rian OrsquoNeillrsquos arrival gives the Armagh a serious cutting edge and they could just be too sharp for Down to handle.The last time Down played Armagh in the Ulster Championship was only two years ago and the job of nullying Clarkersquos influence on the game was handed to Darren OrsquoHagan mdash a marking job that enabled Down to record a notable win.ldquoGoing into that game Oisin McConville was saying that Armagh had one of the best full-forward lines in the country and yet they were still in Division , the Down captain said.Sundayrsquos game canrsquot come quick enough for the Clonduff man and he expects a tough, hard-hitting encounter and fireworks from start to finish.ldquoItrsquos a local derby. Therersquos definitely no love lost. Itrsquos real. People probably think itrsquos not, but here has to be that hatred there, he remarked.ldquoItrsquos like Clonduff playing Kilcoo. I know all the Kilcoo players, but once theyrsquore wearing a dferent jersey on the field you hate them. You need that mdash you need that bit of hunger. Thatrsquos why you play county football.ldquoI want to win. I love playing county football and I think Paddy Tally will get an Ulster title out of Down.

I was putting out slurry on the family farm all day with my friend Jonathan McLaughlin. Earlier on in the day my father had told me all the risks. He cared for me, he wanted me to make sure I was safe.“It came to a quarter to eight at night and my mother called us in for tea. When we were sitting at the table my father said, ‘that’ll do you for today’ and I said, ‘one more load will finish the field’.“Going out past the window my mother called me back and said, ‘you need to put on a coat’ because it was getting wet and cold. I didn’t bother zipping it up.“Jonathan was the age to drive a tractor. He had everything up and running. The tractor was linked to a slurry tanker, and the PTOshaft was running around at approximately   rpm. It drives the vacuum pump which is in front of it. The pump creates the suction to suck the slurry into the tank. It wasn’t working to my pleasing so I thought I’d make some adjustment to it.“With the loose clothing and with a bit of wind my coat became entangled with the shaft. It takes in  feet of material every second. The minute I was caught I didn’t have chance. I remember being taken in, swung onto the ground. I thought it was all over, I’d been killed.“I lay a while longer and came to my senses. I got up onto my feet. I looked down and all I had on me was socks and underwear. My clothes had been ripped off. I looked down to my right and I could see an arm lying about  feet away and I knew right away it was my arm.“I walked over to the house, fully conscious, no tears, no pain, running on adrenalin.“My sister Jane looked out the window at me. She said, ‘Daddy, William is coming past with only one arm’.“My father got me into the car. I still remember my mother standing with her hand over her mouth. Not even a chance to say goodbye – total and utter devastation. I was barely recognisable because I’d been smashed to the ground with such force. I felt so sorry for my father and mother because of the mess and mayhem I was creating for them.”Of his injuries he said: “The arm was completely screwed off. When they got the shaft off and got the coat out, the skin from my back was still inside my coat.Sam McBride: Naomi Long has less ground to make up in this election than when she defeated Peter Robinson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I remember going down to the hospital and my father looked at my wound and saw there was no blood coming out of it. He said, ‘William, you must be bleeding inwardly, you’re going to pass away’.“I’m waiting for this moment of death to come over me. We met an ambulance on the road that got me to Altnagelvin, it had been phoned by my sister Jane.”He said: “At the hospital I was asked what my last request was. I asked for a run in the helicopter. It wasn’t to be because the weather took a turn for the worse. I got taken by ambulance to the Ulster. Thankfully we had some of the best surgeons in the world. They saved me, but they couldn’t get the arm back on because it wasn’t a clean cut. “What I will say isit had been a clean cut I’d have bled to death. It had knotted the blood vessels and removed the nerves which left me with no pain and erted the blood back into the body.“I was fully conscious the whole time. There were no tears. The full medical team came to see me on the Wednesday and told me it was unique. They said the likes of me was never seen before and I’m not boasting about that.”William, whose father lost a leg in a farming accident and whose uncle killed when a tractor flipped over, said: “People say, ‘it’ll never happen to me’, but it can.

If the UK passes a Brexit deal before the summer, its  MEPs will probably never sit.If it leaves by October , the next Brexit deadline, they will only be sitting MEPs for a small number of weeks, given that the parliament will be in recess over the summer.But this is in fact a crucial contest, from almost every perspective: from a unionist perspective, because the Union itself is at stake, and from a nationalist one, because Irish unity is on the agenda in a way that itwasn’t a mere four years ago.From a pro European perspective a big vote for anti Brexit candidates across the UK is one way to put a brake on Britain’s departure, and a good result for them in Northern Ireland strengthens the case for special treatment. The opposite is true from a pro Brexit perspective.Unionists have most at stake and stand to lose badlyTheresa May’s withdrawal agreement goes through.The same is not true in reverse for republicans. The worst that can happen for republicans is that the constitutional status quo in Northern Ireland remains in place.That, however, is the very best that can happen for unionists. Butthe backstop is formalised it is the biggest constitutional change since the  Anglo Irish Agreement, which gave Ireland a consultative role in the running of Northern Ireland.I think the backstop is a small step towards limited joint authority in a specic set of areas.Do not be fooled by the argument that the backstop is an insurance that will never be used. Once it is agreed, Dublin will veto any trade UK-EU arrangements that have any other outcome for the Province.Therefore a large unionist vote will challenge the notion that the backstop has widespread support, and that even some unionists who voted Remain are now disillusioned with being in the UK due to Brexit.Martin Luther – liberator and oppressor all at once Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"There is a tiny fraction of unionists who might feel such alienation, and a larger number of Alliance Party voters .But most of us unionists who voted Remain do not want our place in the UK to be softened in any way.There are polls that purport to show that many unionists back a ‘soft Brexit’. They dothey are asked whether they support that option, unless they are asked whether they support a ‘soft Brexit that involves a border in the Irish Sea,’ in which case it is a very dferent response.Here are two statistics to look out for in terms of unionist share of the vote in next week’s MEP election: .% and .%.The three unionist candidates combined will need to poll above at least the lower of those two figures, and ideally the higher figure.The first stat is the .% who voted for Brexit in Northern Ireland. Its converse, the % who voted Remain, has been cited by ever since, as proof of a clear majority of the Province against departure from the EU.If Diane Dodds, Jim Allister and Danny Kennedy get a combined higher share than that then they can say that the  result in no shape or form has diminished the overall support for unionism.They can even argue that support for Brexit has gone up since  .The second statistic, .%, is the mid point between the .% vote share that unionist candidates got in the council elections earlier this month, and the .% vote unionists got in the  MEP election.The latter was a good outcome for unionists, the former a poor one .If unionists get .%+ of the Northern Ireland valid votes cast this coming Thursday, they will know that they have had a good election .If they get % of the vote or more, it will be an outstanding result. They will be able to say that a majority of voters in Northern Ireland want to implement Brexit, minus the backstop.I think it will be extraordinarily hard for unionists to reach that level for two reasons.First the Alliance surge, which is unlikely to go away given that the party is fielding its high-profile leader. If Alliance gets the .% it got in the council contests, a unionist % share is almost impossible, because the nationalist share has to be below .%.That is almost inconceivable for the second reason, above, which is the motivated mood among nationalists over Brexit and Stormont disputes. The time when nationalist voters were not much motivated, around , is a distant memory.The third MEP seat is up for grabs between four candidates: Naomi Long , Jim Allister , Danny Kennedy , Colum Eastwood .I suspect Mrs Long will struggle to get quite enough first preferences to take the seat.And while I have a hunch that Mr Allister will do well, because he is much more popular than his party and because he is there nearest thing NI has to a Brexit Party candidate, and will perhaps increase his % vote share of , he will struggle to get enough transfers.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"martin luther liberator and oppressor all at once  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  TriggerPrompt url  https:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude + url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Martin Luther ndash liberator and oppressor all at onceMartin LutherHoward GilpinEmail Published::Saturday  May Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Letters\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .htmlThanks,  + email +  has been added to our newsletter..

Instead George picks up on remarks made by Luther to Erasmus then quotes an antisemitic treatise Luther produced.Letter to the editorMartin Luther, great reformer as he was, had open animosity towards the Jews and wrote two treatiesthat are antisemitic.His antisemitism should be acknowledged and not excused. Nothwithstanding, this doesn’t negate the fact God used him mightily in the Reformation in helping bring light into much darkness.As Rev Bernard Howard, an Anglican minister and a Jewish believer in Jesus has said – ‘Luther is to me both hero and anti-hero both liberator and oppressor. Spiritually speaking, he has been my teacher, but in relation to my family he has acted as persecutor.’ Martin Luther like all of us was fallible, he was a sinner and far from perfect. God alone is perfect and thus His Word is perfect and infallible . All Presbyterian elders whether teaching or ruling elders accept this at their ordination.

He will stand alongside Ms Anderson, Mrs Dodds, SDLP leader Colm Eastwood, Mr Allister, Alliance leader Naomi Long, Green leader Clare Bailey, UKIP’s Robert Hill, and Conservative Amandeep Singh Bhogal. Independents Neil Patrick McCann and Jane Morrice are also standing.Speaking to about three dozen UUP members in the Stormont Hotel at am today, where the party launched its European manesto, Mr Kennedy said: “We do not want or need any new borders.“There won’t be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and there can’t be a border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. This doesn’t have to be a choice between either or.”He added: “Leaving the EU without a sensible deal is simply not an option.”He also spoke of threat of a referendum on Irish unity.“We know nationalism is attempting to use Brexit as a key opportunity to realise their ultimate ideal – and there are those who will attempt to use the outcome as an excuse for a border poll,” he said.“That’s why it’s vital I’m ed as a pro-Union voice who can help to bring some certainty, rather than the instability being offered by those who seek either another referendum whether on EU membership or indeed on Irish unity.“I’m very clear – whether you voted Leave or Remain, I will be your voice.”Mallon warns against premature border poll Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The event was broadcast live over Facebook by the News Letter. During the broadcast, one user wrote online about a “sensible deal”: “We all want that... butwe cant get it, as Theresa May now realises, what should happen  No Deal, or a new referendum ”The News Letter put that to Mr Kennedy who said: “We simply can’t give up on this. We can’t say this doesn’t matter any longer. This is too important... and with my influence and my voice as an elected MEP and with colleagues this party will continue to press the case for a sensible Brexit deal.”Pressed further on the idea of keeping No Deal on the table, he said: “No deal has the potential to do serious damage,not fatal damage, to many of our industries.“As someone who loves Northern Ireland, I could not stand up and advocate that and I am astonished that anyone who loves the union as much as I do would be prepared to tolerate that.”The manesto launched by the UUP yesterday distils Mr Kennedy’s positions down to eight things he is either for or against.He is for: “A sensible Brexit deal a secure future for NI within the UK an end to uncertainty for jobs and business no new border.”And he opposes: “Crashing out of the EU Northern Ireland being treated dferently to the rest of the UK a border in the Irish Sea a second referendum.”The manesto’s biggest segment is on the backstop, contained in Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement.This could keep Northern Irelandunder a raft of EU rules for basically as long as the EU wants – something the UUP says “violates” the Belfast Agreement’s principle of consent.With the EU refusing to alter this, the situation facingthe UK is often portrayed as this deal or No Deal. But the UUP “believes a workable alternative is still within reach”.Mr Kennedy told delegates: “I’m disappointed that those who have been loud opponents to a hard border on the island fall silent when it comes to the prospect of a hard border in the Irish Sea.“Unionist concerns around the backstop are just as valid and are afforded equal protection under the Good Friday Agreement as those of our nationalist neighbours about a hard land border.”Mr Kennedy was MLA for Newry and South Armagh solidly from the time the Assembly was set up in  until losing his seat in .He also held executive office as Stormont’s transport minister from  to . He signed on to the dole after losing his seat. Asked what is next for himhe does not win an MEP seat, he said to applause: “Defeat is not an option.”try catch  TrendingFirefighter who died in NI motorbike crash named locallySunday Times Rich List

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave.

Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/border_1.jpg","title":"trusted trader status could help ni firms with brexit","story":"Posted on Monday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland exporters could avoid some of the damaging impact and friction of a hard Brexit by adopting the Government’s ‘trusted trader’ status, Ulster Business can reveal.According to Safeguard AEO, a firm which assists businesses in getting the green light for the so-called Authorised Economic Operatortrading quality mark, the global arrangement could help firms avoid heavy friction with trade, following Brexit.The status is a quality marker, which the Government says allows businesses to fast-track shipments through customs, and is something which could be crucialthe UK leaves the EU without a deal.And while such an arrangement has not yet been firmed up by the Government, Richard Thompson of Safeguard AEO believes it’s something which is seriously being considered.According to figures reported by the BBC,  applications for AEO were received between June  and January this year, with fewer than half the applications being approved.“It is dependent on the arrangement that is put in place between Dublin and say Belfast,” Mr Thompson says.“If you are moving stuff from the north to the south, then that accreditation will be recognised in the south, and those goods could just move .”The AEO is a global scheme, which was first introduced by the World Customs Organisation .The firm provides software and support to both small and large firms, taking them through a green, amber and red light system for the ious stages of the complex AEO system, ensuring each area meets the correct standards before the application is submitted.“Businesses should be thinking very seriously about getting this accreditation. Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects.

For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people.
