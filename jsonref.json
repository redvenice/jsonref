Photos of the garment would appear to confirm Lund\u0027s story, as the bustier worn by Abdul looks identical to the one created by Lund           Lund (pictured with Cindy Crawford in April) says the garment is one of a kind and could not be replicated without the use of master beaders and weavers, and requires a process that takes at least five days to complete          Lund, a childhood best friend of Kim Kardashian (pictured together in their early teens), made the bustier eight years agoBut after getting no response from the singer, 56, Lund says she now has no choice but to sue the \u002780s icon for the return of her item.\u0027I don\u0027t know how she came to have it, I\u0027m not saying she stole it or her stylist stole it or anything,\u0027 Lund said in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV.\u0027I would just like to get it back – it\u0027s obviously my piece.\u0027Abdul\u0027s representative declined to comment on the bustier when approached by DailyMailTV, except to note that the publicity photo was taken two years ago.Lund\u0027s lawyer Stephanie Ovadia told DailyMailTV: \u0027I was retained to see the return of the property after she attempted to contact Paula to no avail.\u0027We are currently in the process of contacting Ms Abdul for the swift return of the property.\u0027Lund, a childhood best friend of Kim Kardashian, made the bustier eight years ago and says creating it took her five days.She told DailyMailTV the piece has sentimental value because her grandmother helped her to create it.\u0027My grandmother helped me make it,\u0027 Lund said. \u0027She sat with me for a few hours and I had a deadline to get it done and she actually weaved some pieces on for me to help me. It\u0027s a very important piece to me.\u0027          The design, which was created from a mixture of silver metallic thread and chiffon, was hand-sewn and was later worn by celebrities, among them Gwen Stefani, Britney Spears and singer Roselyn Sanchez (pictured)           But after getting no response from the singer, 56, Lund says she now has no choice but to sue the 80s icon for the return of her item          Lund (pictured with Kim Kardashian in their younger years) said: \u0027I don\u0027t know why it would be so hard for them to give it back to the rightful owner. It is important to me. I just want it back\u0027The design, which was created from a mixture of silver metallic thread and chiffon, was hand-sewn and was later worn by celebrities, among them Gwen Stefani and Britney Spears.Lund says the garment is one of a kind and could not be replicated without the use of master beaders and weavers, and requires a process that takes at least five days to complete.She says the garment disappeared from her showroom four years ago and assumed it had been taken by accident which is why she never reported the missing item to police.Lund said: \u0027I didn\u0027t report it to the police and the reason why we didn\u0027t is because I figured at the time, it would have been returned, it would have come back.\u0027To be honest, what are the police going to do with a bustier gone missing? They don\u0027t take something like that as seriously.\u0027I figured that through friends and through time, I would eventually get the bustier back. I always honestly thought I would get the bustier back.\u0027\u0027Every moment of life should be savored\u0027: Paula Abdul shares...Kaia Gerber steals the Versace show in flamboyant suit as...Share this article    Lund says she does not want to make an enemy of Abdul but is now hoping to have the piece returned without further problems But despite her hopes, the garment was not seen again until the release of Abdul\u0027s publicity photos, which Lund saw for the first time over the weekend.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it,\u0027 she told DailyMailTV. \u0027I felt two things – I felt elated and I felt excited I could possibly get my piece back again.\u0027But I also felt a little angry because it reminded me that somebody had obtained that piece dishonestly and that doesn\u0027t mean that Paula Abdul did, it doesn\u0027t mean that her stylist did, it means that somebody took that piece and it ended up in her hands and I just hope she does the right thing and gets it back to me.\u0027 Lund says she does not want to make an enemy of Abdul but is now hoping to have the piece returned without further problems.

Emoitional: The Talk is also looking a frequent guests hosts Carrie Ann Inaba and Carnie Wilson per sources close to the production (Inaba in tears in the day Chen announced her exit)          Off they go: Chen is staying on for the next season of Big brother despite leaving The TalkThe Talk has used this tactic in the past as well, most recently prior to the show\u0027s decision to hire Eve.A host of women came on as guests hosts, including singer Michelle Williams and Inaba, after the departure of Aisha Tyler just before the start of the eighth season.Eve was not named as Tyler\u0027s replacement, however, until November, right in the middle of the most important time of the year for any television show - sweeps.It would be no surprise if history repeats itself, and a tune-in to unveil the new host comes in late October or November.In the immediate aftermath of Chen\u0027s departure Inaba stepped in to take her place as did Wilson, with more guest hosts slated to drop by this week. Chen announced the news at the end of the show\u0027s episode on Tuesday in a taped message, fighting back tears as she shared her decision with viewers.She had not yet appeared on the show\u0027s ninth season, and announced that she would be going on indefinite leave last Monday after CBS forced her husband to resign as CEO and chairman.Ten days later she made the leave definite, stating: \u0027I have been at The Talk since the day it started nine years ago and the cast, crew and staff have become family over the years.\u0027Right now I need to spend more time at home with my husband and our young son. So I have decided to leave The Talk.\u0027CBS applauded the hosts in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday.\u0027For eight seasons, Julie Chen has co-hosted The Talk with incredible energy, grace and professionalism. Her talents played a big role in our successful launch of CBS’ first network daytime talk show, and in the series growth into an Emmy Award-winning broadcast,\u0027 read the statement.\u0027All of us here have tremendous appreciation for the dedication and passion she brought to the show every day and for her generous role as an ambassador for CBS Daytime.

Anthony Bourdain\u0027s grief-stricken partner accuses Dove of trying to smear Bourdain as dying with a prostitute and overdosing on heroin. In fact he hanged himself alone          Her side: Asia Argento said that although Bennett (pictured as a young boy in 2004) assaulted her, she \u0027felt sorry for the child I had met, that I cared so much about,\u0027 because he \u0027needed money\u0027          Argento\u0027s first contact with McGowan was a pivotal moment in her life. She explained, \u0027She was the first person, another Weinstein victim, I was talking to\u0027The women\u0027s friendship was forged through their shared trauma and their united goal to use it to bring about a cultural change.To Argento, McGowan was \u0027a sister.\u0027 They even got matching tattoos -a simple dot on Argento\u0027s ankle that is a marked contrast to the intricate ink of Argento\u0027s many other tattoos. (She now plans to have it erased).And when the unthinkable happened and Argento received the devastating news that Bourdain, her lover and confidante of two years, had taken his own life in a French hotel room McGowan\u0027s phone call was one of the very few she answered.She recalled, \u0027Rose said she was in Europe that she would come and see me.\u0027What I didn\u0027t know is that she... told, this notion that she was coming to \u0027\u0027my rescue\u0027\u0027 in an interview.\u0027Today, she said, she views McGowan\u0027s actions as nothing but a \u0027publicity stunt.\u0027                             I thought, \u0027My sister is coming here, to see me, to lift me.\u0027 I thought it was incredibly kind of her to come and help me                        She said, \u0027I was completely numb, paralyzed, obviously I wasn\u0027t reading. I didn\u0027t even want to read the details of Anthony\u0027s death. I was frightened to know.\u0027I found out later that she had given this information to the news so already it was like a publicity stunt but I didn\u0027t see it.\u0027I thought, My sister is coming here, to see me, to lift me. I thought it was incredibly kind of her to come and help me.\u0027The day after Bourdain died Argento went back to work on Italian X-Factor on which she was a judge. She had a choice, she said, - work or never get up again. Today she credits that work with saving her life.She has been forced to step down from the role in the wake of the Bennett allegations.Looking back to the days directly after Bourdain\u0027s death, Argento reflected, \u0027At this time I was so lost in my mind.\u0027According to Argento it was a bizarre interlude during which she traveled to Berlin to meet Rose and her partner Dove, whom she had met for the first time the day before.Dove identifies as gender non-binary and uses the pronoun they Argento calls Dove \u0027she\u0027.          When the unthinkable happened and Argento received the devastating news that Bourdain, her lover and confidante of two years, had taken his own life in a French hotel room McGowan\u0027s phone call was one of the very few she answered      Messages: These are texts Rain Dove sent Asia Argento in which the non-binary model told her they had obtained toxicology and medical examination results and identified a prostitute Anthony Bourdain was with who had come from Russia. All those claims were untrue.  She believed it: Texts shared by Asia Argento show how she (in blue) had come to be convinced that her lover died with a prostitute while on drugs. She now knows that to be untrue  More claims: The texts show that Rain Dove told her they knew where the \u0027syringe\u0027 used by Bourdain was and that they had obtained post-mortem documents      Shared: Asia Argento\u0027s sent these texts to Rain Dove in the form of screengrabs in which she and the CNN host discussed how to deal with Jimmy BennettSitting talking today Argento recognizes how crazy this all sounds.But then, she said, \u0027I am believing her because I am so fragile and I am looking for answers and she is giving me them, something to hold on to, a reason that he did it.\u0027DailyMailTV has spoken with another witness who was present in Berlin who backs up Argento\u0027s account about what Dove said and did. Text messages from Dove to Argento also back her story and show that McGowan was aware in July of Dove\u0027s actions, but telling Argento that she was not part of it.Argento said: \u0027I am a woman completely destroyed at this point. I don\u0027t know what day it is. I thought maybe this was Rose\u0027s Army that she spoke about.

The process happens at this time of year and can depend upon many factors including the animals age and the latitude at which they live.Deer antlers are used primarily  to battle other male deer for mating rights. Male deer grow their first set of antlers when they hit puberty, at approximately one year of age.When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027.          Gary Kramer, 70, captured a barren ground caribou shedding its velvet at Denali National Park, Alaska          When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027. Although there is a lot of blood, the process doesn\u0027t cause the deer any discomfortBy late summer, when testosterone levels are at their peak, the blood vessels shut down around the base of the antlers and they harden into bone.Although there the antlers shed bloody red velvet, the deer do not feel any discomfort from the outgrowth.Velvet peeling typically takes a day or two to complete and those lucky enough to witness this process will often see the deer rubbing their antlers against tree branches.  Hunt for killer tigress: India\u0027s most-celebrated hunter is...These funny photos are guaranteed to make you smile!

By 2.30pm she was experiencing pains every five or six minutes.She went to the toilet and passed a blood clot and by 5.04pm she was actively bleeding, nauseous, faint and weak.By 6pm the pains were nearly every minute and an emergency caesarean section was carried out.Miss Mears was under general anaesthetic and when she woke up she was told Millie-Rae had not survived. A small cut was spotted on the back of the infant\u0027s head.She said in a statement: \u0027I found it difficult to comprehend what happened and I am constantly looking for answers.\u0027Consultant Paul Flynn, who specialises in obstetrics, was in charge of delivering the baby.He explained how  he cut through the placenta in order to minimise any blood loss - initially with a knife and then using a finger to make a hole in the cavity.He used a scalpel to cut through what he thought was membrane but turned out to be the top of the baby\u0027s head.Giving evidence at the hearing he said: \u0027What presented to me looked like membranes pushing through.

The process happens at this time of year and can depend upon many factors including the animals age and the latitude at which they live.Deer antlers are used primarily  to battle other male deer for mating rights. Male deer grow their first set of antlers when they hit puberty, at approximately one year of age.When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027.          Gary Kramer, 70, captured a barren ground caribou shedding its velvet at Denali National Park, Alaska          When the antlers, which unlike horns have blood vessels, nerves and cartilage, are growing, they are soft to the touch or spongy which is called \u0027deer velvet\u0027. Although there is a lot of blood, the process doesn\u0027t cause the deer any discomfortBy late summer, when testosterone levels are at their peak, the blood vessels shut down around the base of the antlers and they harden into bone.Although there the antlers shed bloody red velvet, the deer do not feel any discomfort from the outgrowth.Velvet peeling typically takes a day or two to complete and those lucky enough to witness this process will often see the deer rubbing their antlers against tree branches.  Hunt for killer tigress: India\u0027s most-celebrated hunter is...These funny photos are guaranteed to make you smile!

One in ten did not cover gadgets stolen from commercial vehicles.About one in three would not meet the cost of unauthorised calls or data — so you could be left with a big bill if someone makes overseas calls or watches films on your phone.          With some insurers only burglary and muggings are generally covered, while pickpocketing and distraction thefts are notTwo-thirds of policies ban you from making a claim for a certain period — sometimes several weeks — after taking out your policy.Defaqto analysed 150 different mobile phone insurance policies and identified 25 common exclusions that might prevent a claim being paid, or make it harder for you to claim.Money Mail also found dozens more obscure terms and conditions in the small print, which sometimes stretched to three pages.Insurer Cover My had 40 exclusions, Insurancefair 32 and Better Buy Insurance, 30, and Debenhams Gadget Insurance, 34.Many insurers will not cover stolen phones left \u0027unattended\u0027 — but the definition of this is vague and varies a lot.Better Buy Insurance says it would turn down a claim where the phone was \u0027not within your sight at all times and out of your arms-length reach\u0027.One policy sold through broker HomeRescueCo, states: \u0027You must keep your gadget within your possession, control and proximity at all times\u0027.ZugarZnap uses the hashtag #stupidhappenz to advertise its accidental damage cover, but will not cover those who \u0027knowingly take a risk with your gadget\u0027.It says examples include, \u0027in a cafe or pub, you leave your gadget on the table when you go to the counter, the bar or the toilet instead of taking it with you\u0027.Martyn James, of online consumer complaints service Resolver, says: \u0027Insurers need to learn there\u0027s a big difference between being careless and being robbed.

The downside is you will usually pay a higher excess.A ZugarZnap spokesman says it offers a free basic phone to customers taking out its gadget insurance which they could use on nights out or give to their children for events such as school trips and sleepovers, to avoid risking a costlier device.Both Tinhat Insurance and Insurancefair say they typically accept over 90 per cent of claims received. A Tinhat Insurance spokesman says: \u0027The typical value of a gadget we insure is £750 and as a comparison, we believe that most customers would not leave the equivalent in cash unattended and in view, in the same circumstances.\u0027Debenhams, Cover My, Insurancefair and Better Buy Insurance say exclusions were clearly stated online and also in policy documents. Asked why Debenhams needed a crime report, a company spokesman says this is because \u0027it may assist in the recovery of the lost or stolen item as well as in local crime fighting.\u0027A spokesman for broker HomeRescueCo says that it does not consider the alcohol clause \u0027an excessive term\u0027.Fees back in tradesFees back in tradesGood for big potsTools and fund ideas\u0026gt Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":null,"title":"Visiting igloos taking husky rides Lapland stopped claim indigenous leaders","story":"    The sight of husky dogs pulling a family on a sledge through a winter forest in Lapland (pictured) could soon be over should indigenous leaders have their way          These igloos (pictured) are not in keeping with Sami culture, according to representatives of the group.

But still she failed to find someone to settle down with.As dating proved unsuccessful, Samantha considered adoption — but was put off by the fact that if she met a partner after embarking on the process as a single woman, she would have to begin again.So via the privately-owned European Sperm Bank, she paid £2,000 for sperm from a Danish donor called Lance, who was a 35-year-old medical student.\u0027My research showed children who have been conceived through a donor usually want to know their roots, and the Bank provided his photograph and a recording of his voice which I have kept for the children,\u0027 says Samantha.\u0027I didn\u0027t worry about having babies without a dad.

They are incredibly close, though very different.\u0027          Spending £12,000 on IVF,  Samantha, pictured with Rory, gave birth to twins made from the same embryoInstead of a funeral, which Samantha believes would be too upsetting for Grace and Rory, she is having a \u0027living wake\u0027 this week at a local pub. The dress code is pink, and Samantha\u0027s pink kaftan and wig are already laid out in preparation.\u0027I want people to celebrate my life while I\u0027m here,\u0027 she says.She is donating her body to the University of Nottingham School of Health Sciences for medical training, after which, she says, \u0027they can stick any ashes left into a firework and fire it into the air. My children don\u0027t need a graveyard to remember me by.\u0027Instead, Grace is planning a fairy garden in honour of her mummy, for which she has already painted fairies and a pink ballerina stone.\u0027I\u0027m not religious but I am spiritual and I\u0027m not scared of dying,\u0027 says Samantha. \u0027I\u0027ve told Grace I\u0027ll always be around — that whenever she\u0027s thinking about me, I\u0027ll be thinking about her.\u0027In the letters she is in the process of writing to her children, she will tell them not to be afraid to follow their dreams. \u0027Don\u0027t put off what you want to do. Pay compliments, speak to strangers. Be kind.\u0027How would she like Grace and Rory to think of their mother, as they grow up without her?

This week the father of four was pictured, somewhat bafflingly, with what appeared to be a full head of hair — not to mention a line free-forehead, dazzling white teeth and cheeks full enough to make a twenty- something envious.So how is Beckham holding back the years? And what has he done to his barnet?HAS HE HAD A TRANSPLANT?Beckham\u0027s camp have refused to comment on whether he\u0027s had a transplant — a surgical procedure in which hair is extracted from an area of the scalp with dense growth and re-implanted into thinning areas under local anaesthetic.Beckham himself once suggested he wouldn\u0027t be tempted. \u0027There is definitely nothing wrong with doing that,\u0027 he said in 2012, \u0027but I don\u0027t think personally I would. If I do start showing signs of going bald, then I will shave it off.\u0027Hair transplant surgeon Dr Bessam Farjo, meanwhile, says there is no way the star could have had a transplant that resulted in a head of new hair in the space of a few weeks. \u0027Transplanted hair takes about three months just to break through the skin,\u0027 says Dr Farjo. He adds, however, that this doesn\u0027t mean Beckham hasn\u0027t had a transplant at some earlier stage.\u0027It\u0027s possible he might have had a transplant many months ago and been extremely clever, clipping his hair short to ert attention from it.\u0027David Beckham admits driving his £200,000 Bentley at 59mph...Tax avoiders who dodged the roll call of dishonour:...Share this articleA transplant on the front of the head extending to the crown would take around ten hours and cost around £10,000. As Dr Farjo says: \u0027A lot more men than you think have had a hair transplant, including top names who want to keep it discreet.\u0027PUMP UP THE VOLUMEEven if he has had a transplant, says Dr Farjo, there is \u0027definitely some sort of cosmetic trickery\u0027 at play to make Beckham\u0027s hair look thicker.\u0027It\u0027s possible he\u0027s using a camouflage product, like a hair fibre spray, to give the illusion of thicker hair,\u0027 he says. \u0027It\u0027s a bit like putting on make-up.\u0027Fibre sprays work in two ways. \u0027They reduce the contrast in colour between the hair and skin so you don\u0027t see the scalp so easily, and they coat the hairs with a powdery material to make the hair appear thicker,\u0027 says Dr Farjo.\u0027It is quite common for make-up artists to use them on men in the media to make their hair look better under cameras. It lasts until you wash it out.\u0027And whether, in Beckham\u0027s case, the end result is ageing Adonis or nondescript middle-office-manager is a matter of opinion. \u0027It looks good — but maybe a bit over the top,\u0027 says Dr Farjo.A MANE TO DYE FORRegardless of how he got the volume back, there is no denying his hair has changed colour, with Becks\u0027s reinvention as a brunette a marked move away from the blond locks of his past. But while many might think he\u0027s well shot of the highlights, the jury\u0027s out on this new shade.Mark Woolley, creative director at Electric hairdressing group, says his new look does make Beckham\u0027s hair look thicker. \u0027It looks like he\u0027s had it coloured half a shade darker. Blond hair absorbs light whereas dark hair reflects light which increases the density.\u0027He adds, however, that this \u0027can look severe\u0027 especially given the grey in his beard, and says Beckham would be better off going grey.FRESH-FACED IN HIS FORTIESBecks\u0027s face is largely wrinkle free – unusual for a man in his mid-40s. His cheeks are impressively full, and his smile lines less pronounced than in recent years.Of course, this could be down to a diligent skin care routine. \u0027One thing I do love is a face mask,\u0027 he said recently.Cynics might scoff, but cosmetic doctor Dr Mervyn Patterson insists good skincare can indeed make the skin more youthful.\u0027It is entirely possible his youthful looks could be the result of a good skin care regime and non-invasive treatments,\u0027 he says.\u0027Micro dermabrasian, for example, removes the dead skin cells to make the skin look smoother while peels — acids applied to the skin — may rejuvenate the skin and stimulate it into increasing collagen, the support structure underneath.\u0027SOMETHING TO SMILE ABOUTAs a member of Manchester United\u0027s youth team David\u0027s teeth were slightly yellow, with the odd one as curved as his legendary free kicks at goal. Now they are straight, devoid of gaps and whiter than an England football kit.According to Dr Mervyn Druian of The London Centre for Cosmetic Dentistry, he is likely to have had both braces and veneers.\u0027I\u0027m assuming that David would have had a lingual brace, which is placed at the back of your teeth and invisible. Veneers, in which very fine porcelain is bonded over the natural teeth, are likely to have changed their colour and lengths. His orthodontic treatment could have taken anything from four months to a year.\u0027He adds: \u0027I\u0027m sure the orthodontics were done some time ago, with other enhancements done more recently. The cost would have been around £8,000 to £10,000 and it is a very good result indeed.\u0027A FURROW-FREE FOREHEADHe could just lead a worry-free life, but Beckham\u0027s forehead is incredibly smooth for a man of his age. This could be attributed to a skilled application of Botox, although Beckham did specifically say he didn\u0027t \u0027agree\u0027 with the procedure last year.Dr Patterson doesn\u0027t think Beckham has had Botox, but says it \u0027is very much on the rise among men, with lots of partners encouraging them to have it done\u0027.Mr Azhar Aslam, lead surgeon at Linia Cosmetic Surgery, says: \u0027There seems to be less indention in some of the lines in his forehead and his frown line which would suggest that he has had some Botox in this area.\u0027However, it is probably only a small amount as he does not have the frozen look.\u0027 He adds: \u0027David has a great expressive face and I doubt he has had Botox around the eye area.\u0027As a surgeon I would also recommend not having Botox in this area as David has a great smile, which comes through in his eyes.\u0027So what else can Becks do to halt his hair loss...TRANSFORMATION OF THE TOUPEEHair pieces have come a long way in recent years, with celebrities from Charlie Sheen to John Travolta reported to have worn them.\u0027With a hair piece you can have any look you want,\u0027 says Dr Farjo.          Beckham, pictured in his wonky-toothed heyday, has sported many hairstyles over the yearsHair4all, a company offering \u0027non-surgical hair replacement systems\u0027 from around £550, says demand has never been higher thanks to men wanting to look like their favourite reality television stars. After an initial consultation their hair pieces are designed over a 12-14 week period, stay attached to the head for up to a month.THE VAMPIRE OPTIONFor men with thinning hair and bulging wallets, there is a version of the \u0027vampire facial\u0027 in which the patient\u0027s own blood is injected back into their scalps.In a \u0027platelet rich plasma treatment\u0027 (PRP) blood is said to stimulate the hair follicle, prolonging its growth phase. The blood is collected and separated so that the platelets — which contain protein and stimulants — can be injected back into the scalp.The treatment takes 90 minutes under local anaesthetic. One treatment every four to six months for the first year is recommended and one treatment a year for maintenance thereafter. Treatments cost upwards of £1,000 and there have yet to be any major clinical trials on it.\u0027It\u0027s fashionable, and good at preparing the scalp for a hair transplant, but the jury is definitely out on how beneficial this is,\u0027 says Glenn Lyons, clinical director at The Philip Kingsley Trichological Clinic in London. \u0027There is no substantial evidence it works.\u0027THE PROVEN TREATMENTOne of the only proven methods for preventing hair loss is minoxidil, sold under the brand name Regaine. It is used for male pattern baldness, in which the body becomes over-sensitive to male hormones called androgens, which can block hair growth.One survey found 70.6 per cent of 352 patients reported an improvement in hair growth after 16 weeks. The topical lotion can be bought over the counter (Boots sells a three-month supply for £69.99).It was originally developed as a drug to lower blood pressure, with its hair loss remedies only discovered when people taking it realised they were growing hair where they had lost it.FISH PILLS AND CAFFEINE SHAMPOOOne of the biggest hair loss \u0027cures\u0027 currently on the market are supplements such as Nourkrin and Viviscal which contain protein extracts from fish that are believed to regenerate hair follicles.But they come at a cost and require commitment — tablets need to be taken twice a day for six months for best results, and cost around £50 for a month\u0027s supply.Proponents of caffeine shampoo claim it stops the hair roots being weakened by androgens, and in doing so encourages hair growth.But there is still limited research to suggest it does work and this March the Advertising Standards Authority told the makers of Alpecin Caffeine Shampoo that they must no longer advertise that the product can reduce hair loss. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/21/50201FC200000578-0-image-a-17_1536871696636.jpg","title":"Tories party racism Windrush descendent tells Labour conference","story":"    Diane Abbott said \u0027false and toxic\u0027 rhetoric about immigrants led directly to the scandal, which saw more than 60 British citizens of Caribbean descent wrongly deportedShe urged the conference to vote in favour of repealing the Immigration Act 2014, which aimed to make it as difficult as possible for unregistered migrants to stay in the UK, including by forcing landlords and charities to carry out ID checks.The bill was put forward when Mrs May was home secretary and backed by Labour.  Tony Blair pumps nearly £7million into his charity that...\u0027Have I tuned into an episode of Loose Women?\u0027 New-look BBC...Share this article\u0027Can you imagine living in a country which indefinitely detains its own citizens?

Her vagina may just have been written out of history. While there was no absolute proof – and one blazing bit of contradictory evidence – it was until now generally believed that this Irish model and artist posed for one of the most outrageous nudes of all time, Gustave Courbet’s 1866 painting L’Origine du monde. A new discovery by a French researcher suggests it is not her after all on that bed but a dancer called Constance Queniaux.I’d like to put in a word for Hiffernan. Putting a face to the woman in this painting may seem a contradiction in terms. We only see her torso, thighs, her breasts, and her lovingly painted, gloriously triumphant and powerful sex organ. Yet it’s particularly tempting to imagine Hiffernan’s features hidden under that white sheet. It not only gives this picture a fuller human identity but adds a carnal dimension to some other very beautiful 19th-century paintings.It would also make my life a lot easier, OK, if we can stick with Hiffernan because I identify her as Courbet’s world-creating sexual being in a book I’ve just finished. The editor is going to love me making a pedantic pudendal revision at this late stage.James Abbott McNeill Whistler’s Symphony in White, No 1: The White Girl is an ethereal vision of shimmering monochrome paleness that seems to transport us far from the sensual realm Courbet painted. Only the bright red lips and hair of its model anchor it in the fleshly world at all. This is a painting of Hiffernan clothed. She became Whistler’s lover in 1860 at a time when this flamboyant American was negotiating a unique avant garde career between Paris and London. The White Girl may look like an aesthete’s refinement of pre-Raphaelite dreams of poetic womanhood, but when Whistler submitted it to the Paris Salon in 1863 it was rejected along with Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe and shown instead at the Salon des Refusés – one of the great events in the birth of modern art.So even before Hiffernan posed as Courbet’s revolutionary nude – supposing she did – she was at the heart of Paris modernism, provoking the traditionalists with her abstract shimmering into a whiter shade of pale.Whistler’s most powerful portrayal of her gets us closer to the flesh of Courbet’s picture. In his painting Wapping, done between 1860 and 1864, he brings the insolent realism of Manet to London’s docklands. In front of a riverscape of Manet-like painted silkiness, we see a woman in conversation with two men. She leans back sensually against a railing over the olive river, her loose red hair not only revealing her identity as Hiffernan but also suggesting her freedom from Victorian morals. In fact Hiffernan is playing a prostitute. Wapping was so famous for its sex trade in the mid 19th century that JMW Turner’s executor John Ruskin imagined a pub the artist owned there must have been a brothel, where he went to draw his secret nudes.Hiffernan is a strong, characterful, daring presence in Whistler’s avant garde paintings and it makes a great completion of her adventures as a model if she also showed everything in the boldest painting of the age.You’ve probably noticed the very obvious problem, even before documentary evidence pointed to a new candidate – her red hair does not match the dark brown pubic mane of Courbet’s nude.Against that is the fact that she spent time with Courbet in 1866 and was probably his lover. She does apparently appear in his painting The Sleepers, of two naked women in bed together, which was done that year for Khalil-Bey, the Turkish diplomat and lover of erotic art who also commissioned The Origin of the World. So Hiffernan was working and in all likelihood sleeping with Courbet in the year he painted his most outrageous masterpiece. And Whistler was an artist famously attracted to colour for colour’s sake. Maybe he exaggerated the redness of his girlfriend’s hair.For me, the jury is out.

Her novel imagines those last moments It was the manner of her death that was so brutal. It was gruesome. When Louisa Collins became the first woman hanged at Darlinghurst jail and the last woman hanged in New South Wales, the executioner botched the job. The trap door didn’t open, and then, after being banged with a mallet, it did open, and she fell through with so much force that her head was nearly severed and her windpipe left exposed.It was an image, says author Janet Lee, “that stuck with me, the image of the woman on the scaffold. Here was this woman who had never been known to confess, who expected a reprieve – was that what she was thinking in those last few moments?”Collins had walked calmly to her death on 8 January 1889, stoic, pitiful, believing her life would be spared at the last minute. “They will never hang a woman,” she had declared in the last hours of her life.Her death was controversial. A saga covered in salacious detail by the newspapers of the day, fiercely debated in parliament, heavily petitioned by the men and women of the colony. The 41-year-old mother of 10 children had endured four trials for the deaths of both her husbands, allegedly by arsenic found in rat poison she was one of the only people in the world to be tried four times for murder.The evidence against her was circumstantial. She had nursed them both as they lay dying of similar violent stomach illnesses. One trial for the wilful murder of her first husband, Charles Andrews, and two for her second husband, Michael Collins, had returned hung juries – all of whom were men, 36 in total. The crown pressed on with a fourth trial, for Michael Collins, and finally got their guilty verdict. The chief witness was her 11-year-old daughter May, who testified that she had seen a box of the poison Rough on Rats in the kitchen.Louisa Collins represented a threat to the men of the colony, and her story was political. In opposition, Sir Henry Parkes had argued for mercy in a previous hanging case for rape. Now that he was premier he was decidedly in favour of the hanging of Louisa, who thundered that the alleged murder of her second husband was “one of the most cruel, inexcusable, and frightful murders ... in the world’s history.”Doctors who attended Michael noted that Louisa had been drinking alcohol, and the police reported that she was inebriated when arrested – unseemly behaviour for a woman. It was reported that she was “cold” in the courtroom during her trials. “She didn’t show a lot of expression, something that might have been held against her,” says Lee. “She wasn’t typical of that era, she was not weeping or weak.”Even so, she begged for her life in a letter to Govenor Carrington two days before her death. “Oh my Lord. Pray have mercy and pity on me and spare my life. I beg and implore you to have mercy on me. I have seven children ... spare me my Lord for their sake.”Lee’s novel The Killing of Louisa is written in the first person, as Collins awaits the gallows and talks about her life to the priest.Lee says: “In my head this is very much fiction I have picked out little pieces of the story and imagined things around those. There were hundreds of newspaper articles, I went and revisited all the primary sources the NSW archives has the judges records written in this beautiful spidery hand writing. I used the facts as we know them as a guide, and tried not to stray too far.”She describes how hard life was for poor, working-class women. Louisa was born in Belltrees, in the Hunter Valley, and was sent away at 14 to be a domestic in the Merriwa home of a solicitor, where she became a “country coquette”, it was reported.At the urging of her mother she married the local butcher, Charles Andrews, at 18 he was 13 years older and she later said “had always been boring”. She had children in quick succession, two dying in infancy, and the family moved to Botany. But it was a drudge feeding all those children, washing, cooking for the boarders the family took in Louisa would retreat to the pub.“They had incredibly hard lives, the clothing was so restrictive,” Lee says. “It just would have been every single day boiling the copper, washing clothes, lugging the water the day to day effort of that era would have just worn you down, everything was so labour intensive.”Louisa could also be overly fond of the boarders, in particular the much younger Michael Collins, whom Charles threw out in a fight in the street and who, Lee says, “was a bit of a rogue”. Collins was soon back after Charles’s death. Louisa was very eager to get Charles’s will drawn up as he lay dying, and rushed to collect his insurance policy after his death. She did not wear black mourning clothes, instead throwing a party and dancing with her lover. She was pregnant when she married Collins three months later their child, John, died in infancy, and 13 months after their marriage, Collins too was dead.It is hard to see what her motive might have been for this death: a woman with so many children had no way of supporting herself she needed a husband. By then the insurance money was gone – Michael Collins was a gambler.Lee’s book follows on from the 2014 book Last Woman Hanged: a meticulous five-year investigation into Louisa’s life and death by Caroline Overington. Neither woman will speculate on whether Collins was guilty. “I know enough to know I don’t know,” says Lee.“I don’t know if Louisa was guilty,” Overington tells  Australia, “but neither, beyond a reasonable doubt, did the fourth and final jury nor did the judge who sentenced her to hang, despite the prosecution having no weapon, no witnesses, and no motive for the death of Michael Collins.”The women who petitioned for Louisa would go on to form the suffragette movement. “There was an enormous move in Australia at that time to give women more rights women were starting to fight for the vote.”Louisa Collins represented a threat to the men of the colony, her story was political.“How can it be,” says Overington “that we know the names of the bushrangers, the gold diggers, the explorers, but not this fascinating story of a woman who faced four juries on a charge of murder. Our silence has allowed braying mobs to form around other women both in the dock (Lindy Chamberlain) and in the court of public opinion it allowed the framing of women as calculating and manipulative to continue for another century it encouraged the idea that a sexually adventurous, curious, rebellious woman – Louisa liked to drink and dance and be in love – is immoral, a danger to society. We must dispense with her at once!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb8151250f6346832ec296f7163c3ac3981302d/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3504f54f5859081232b509375dcfc2b3","title":"versace takeover makes business sense and fashion sense","story":"Michael Kors’ acquisition of the Italian fashion house will modernise the brand and drive salesThat a brand like Versace, with a DNA so entrenched in the exclusive and luxurious Italian aesthetic, has aligned itself with Michael Kors, a label known for its accessibility, has surprised many who were expecting it to announce an imminent IPO. But if 40 years of Versace has taught us anything, it’s not to underestimate the brand or Donatella, the woman who has steered it since her brother Gianni’s death in 1997.Michael Kors quit studying at New York’s acclaimed Fashion Institute of Technology just nine months after enrolling in 1977 when he was offered the chance to sell his own designs at Manhattan’s Lothar’s boutique, where he had a part-time job.Kors – born Karl Anderson Jr – soon had his designs in Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale’s. However, his company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1993, after a partner firm stopped selling his lower-priced designs under licence.The company was revived by an investment from LVMH, which was part of a deal when Kors joined as the group’s Céline brand as creative director. Kors floated the company on the NYSE in 2011. The shares soared in 2014, making Kors a billionaire.In recent years his signature tote bags, with gold MK swing fobs have become the brand’s trademark – at around £250 they are seen as affordable luxury. However, the company has been struggling with falling sales and in 2017 announced plans to close 125 stores to re-establish the label as a more exclusive brand.“For the luxury conglomerate landscape, these two companies might not seem like natural bedfellows,” said Kathryn Bishop, the deputy foresight editor and luxury sector specialist at The Future Laboratory. “But Michael Kors could bring much-needed modernisation to the label in an era when sexy doesn’t sell quite like it used to, and perceived Italian rival Gucci continues to innovate, winning the attention and spend of younger, globally minded shoppers.”In the 24 hours since it was first reported a deal with the American investor was imminent, Versace has been inundated with messages on her official Instagram account from followers imploring her to reconsider the sale. “Please don’t sell Versace to MK!!! That would be like Gucci selling to Primark! Versace is worth so much more than 2 billion and MK knows it,” said one.Confirmation that Versace will continue to lead the creative side of the business will help appease critics.Bishop agrees with John D Idol, chief executive of Michael Kors, in thinking the acquisition of Versace can follow the same trajectory, as well as helping the company to become one of the US’s most powerful conglomerates.“It comes at a time when both brands have witnessed a slowdown of sales, meaning both businesses could potentially draw on one another’s strengths and expertise,” she said. “This takeover is likely to position the future of Michael Kors and Versace alongside the accessories-focused group Tapestry Inc, which includes Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, rather than powerhouses Kering and LVMH.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6bda1e22f0a7aee510c867839b0e97043f12f7d/510_340_1895_1137/master/1895.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a68bc0900ae0b832ece00230dd3777b4","title":"no deal brexit minor port delays 30 minutes bankrupt 1 in 10 uk firms","story":"Supply chain chiefs at 1,300 surveyed firms say firms are already stockpiling parts amid fear of no-deal BrexitDelays of only half an hour at UK ports and the Irish border would risk one in 10 British firms going bankrupt, according to a report laying bare the severe risk to the economy from no-deal Brexit.According to the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), failure to reach a deal with Brussels before March could trigger massive queues of trucks at British borders from a vast increase in paperwork and checks to clear customs.From a survey of more than 1,300 UK and EU-based supply chain managers, the personnel responsible for navigating customs controls for their companies, a tenth at UK firms said it would risk bankruptcy if goods were delayed by between 10 and 30 minutes at the border.The warning comes amid the increasing likelihood of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal in little more than six months time, after Theresa May failed to win support for her Brexit plan from European leaders and said both sides had reached an impasse.Several major UK firms have warned of the risks from tougher border controls, including the retail chain Next, and carmakers such as Honda and Jaguar Land Rover who rely on thousands of parts arriving from the EU each day.JLR has cut staff working hours, while Honda has said a no-deal Brexit could add 60,000 extra pieces of paperwork for imports and exports to the UK while costing the firm tens of millions of pounds.“It’s such a potential car crash,” said John Glen, economist at CIPS, adding: “Common sense has got to prevail. We need to have a two-year transition period and to get something sorted out during that. The idea of day-one no-deal is just crazy.”Economists have warned tougher border controls, import tariffs and other barriers to trade in the event of no-deal Brexit would have severe consequences for the economy, with one consultancy estimating the cost at around £1bn per year.Researchers at Imperial College London estimate just two extra minutes of checks could more than triple the existing queues at ports, potentially leading to motorway tailbacks in Kent up to 29 miles long.Leading Brexiters have dismissed the warnings as scaremongering and urged walking away from negotiations without a deal and striking free trade agreements around the world instead.Ministers have also attempted to downplay the concerns by suggesting they could relax efforts to collect border taxes to maintain the free movement of imports and exports in the event of no-deal.There are precedents for disruption, including Operation Stack on the M20, which forced trucks to a standstill in 2015 amid tunnel fires and industrial action in Calais. Typically used for a few days each year, it had a lengthier impact three years ago when 7,000 trucks were stranded, taking 36 hours to work their way through.Some food products did not make it to market because they went off in the queue, while others arrived so late that there were late penalties. Rolls-Royce was forced to delay its production line when goods did not arrive in time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ca1d9508982af66fd6278500ced6814dd25157e/0_155_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0198b603502ac8885265ff5ec6d5c8af","title":"labour second referendum democracy brexit","story":"People always say politics is ugly to watch up close, and they’re talking about the cynicism and manipulation, the treachery, the low cunning beneath the high rhetoric. Democracy in action is ugly in a different way, more like a jumble sale: mess, chaos, mountains of tedium, elbows everywhere. You have to stay alert because you know that underneath the polyester there’s something – not wishing to overextend an analogy, let’s call it a second vote on Brexit – that you would treasure.The Labour conference in Liverpool this week had that jumble sale feel. In any process that is remotely pluralistic, there are too many people in the room. And so 150 Labour delegates met to discuss their composite Brexit motion, boiling 150 motions from different constituency parties down to one single motion, which was passed  this afternoon.It was a heroic, multi-houred marathon on which there were scores of perspectives, none of which was “Hallelujah”. Most of the motions that were fed in had a strong anti-Brexit flavour, and were firmly supportive of a referendum on any deal. They were opposed by a loose collection of the cautious, lefty Brexiters and ultra-loyalists who would prefer not to hold the leadership to anything. The final motion read as a series of conditional measures: if the government is defeated, but if a general election isn’t called, then Labour will campaign for a public vote, whose terms are yet undecided.The post-match analysis seemed to be that this was a defanging of the members, all the better to roll them over later. In fact, this is what participation looks like: frustrating, iterative, inconclusive and interpretable. I’m told one memorable point of the meeting was Keir Starmer saying: “Right, now we have to agree what we mean by ‘consensus’.” The mind boggles as to how they kept it to five hours.In a period of flux, as a party moves from one version of democracy (nominal) to another (meaningful), proceedings are garishly splenetic. The week began with a vote on proposals from the party’s year-long democracy review. From the outside, it all looks ridiculous, tautologous, self-referential: what kind of a party has, as the first line of its agenda, a battle over its own rules?At its kernel, inevitably, was the issue of how easy it is for local party members to deselect their Labour MP. Momentum wanted mandatory reselections, which would see all Labour MPs face a selection battle against challenger candidates before every general election. It got another fudge instead: a lower threshold for triggering a full reselection selection process. Now it will happen if a third of local party branches and affiliated trade union branches express dissatisfaction with the local MP, rather than a half.The argument in favour of mandatory reselection is unremarkable and straightforward. On the one hand, if an MP is chosen by party members, why should that choice be immutable? Circumstances change the composition of the party changes MPs change. My local MP, Kate Hoey, appeared at a Brexit rally last week with Nigel Farage and David Davis. The idea that Hoey represents Vauxhall Labour party – which is fiercely anti-Brexit – is flat-out silly. On the other hand, internal contests use energy that could be directed elsewhere – towards one’s political opponents, for instance.It’s a debate that could play out quite reasonably, both sides having clear elements of truth and strength. But emotions run so high that pragmatism doesn’t get a look-in. MPs who oppose mandatory reselection say their duty is to all their constituents, not just to Labour party members, much as a parent is bound to love all their children equally. The MP Stella Creasy delivered a stinging critique of “toxic” Momentum at a rally: “If you think being political means sitting in meetings … you can do one.”If a political party is to mean anything, there has to be a mechanism that connects members to its decisions. Those members must, by definition, carry more weight than constituents who aren’t members, with the obvious proviso that anyone who wants more weight can always join. Otherwise, it’s not a democratic party – it’s a kind of political burlesque, where MPs put on a show of representation and party members distinguish themselves by cheering the loudest.But democracy is extremely painful: even if everyone were courteous, which we know they aren’t, participation is challenging. It doesn’t respect seniority. People cannot really be disciplined, only persuaded. Being political actually does mean sitting in meetings, and worse: having no control over who else is in the meeting, or what they think.It has become fashionable to say, in weary amusement, that Labour is replaying the 1980s that this is a cul-de-sac in which it has lost itself before, from which it will sooner or later emerge. But the goal is not to return to a Labour party where we can all move along because there’s nothing to see: it’s a pluralistic ecosystem so densely populated that differences cannot be obliterated by fury or stamped out by discipline, only resolved through creativity.Two days after that composite meeting, Starmer committed to a second referendum with a remain option on the ballot. It was all anyone wanted: not to erase the referendum, just to revisit it in light of the disaster of its unfolding.It was, as one conference delegate described, the result of “ordinary people making sound decisions, for the many not the few”. That’s the distinction of democracy. It’s ugly to see its workings, but it’s beautiful when it works."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60f6cd03c5c089861f9e11f2f0710cfda80bba0/171_115_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=010d872d0350e7937de6f55d796e36cc","title":"ebb and flow britains tidal coastline in pictures","story":"Photographers David Levene and Christopher Thomond picked spots around Britain’s coastline at high and low tideby  David Levene and  Christopher Thomond Words by  Patrick BarkhamThe tide is a long wave. The vertical movement of water pulled by a constellation of air pressure, wind, topography, the sun and the elliptical orbit of the moon is rarely visible to the naked eye. Instead we see the impact of this irrepressible force on our coastline roughly every six hours, when the tide is high and when it is low.The British coast has some of the mightiest tides in the world – the Bristol Channel has the second biggest rise and fall after Nova Scotia – and two  photographers, David Levene and Christopher Thomond, spent much of the summer exploring how the tide’s ebb and flow reveals different worlds.Arnside in Lancashire. Photographs: Christopher ThomondThomond relied on his naked eye to line up each high- and low-tide image. “I found them quite a struggle – technically it was difficult to line the two pictures up in your head,” he admits. “I’d find a vantage point at low tide and come back eight hours later and the markers I had in my head to line up the image had disappeared.”Thomond says people probably imagine taking pictures of tides at beautiful coastline spots to be a rather lovely holiday job, but the reality was he had to squeeze in the work between more mundane tasks. The “pure practicalities” – particularly getting two pictures in good light – overtook any pleasure in admiring the liminal world revealed and then covered by the tide, he says. “I didn’t choose a view, set up the tripod, wait for six hours and take another picture. I shot five or six scenes from the same area and tried to get some variety and replicate each one. You could never quite predict how somewhere was going to look at high tide.”Fossil hunting at Lyme Regis, Dorset. Photographs: David LeveneLevene tried to begin with a compelling low-tide picture. The biggest challenge was obtaining the high-tide picture of Lyme Regis on one of the hottest days of the year. He took the low-tide image of fossil hunters from the top of a fragment of eroding cliff that was only accessible at low tide. “I then had to wake at the crack of dawn, come down with a coffee and suncream and walk out at low tide and wait for the high tide, so I was sat out there in the heatwave for about eight hours.”The Wash from Snettisham, Norfolk. Photographs: David LeveneLevene was often too busy trying different photographic positions or checking tidal apps to experience the meditative beauty of the ebb and flow of the tide. But he was moved by the unexpected drama of the North Sea flooding over great expanse of the Wash at Snettisham.“The way that the water came in through the mudflats was just amazing,” he says. “It takes forever to come in but for the last 40 minutes the channels suddenly fill up. I was taking pictures all the while.”Taking the photographs from exactly the same position was sometimes unexpectedly difficult. Levene imagined he might mark the spot for his tripod and return six hours later, but in often busy places or natural beaches it wasn’t possible to leave a durable mark.Instead he used his eye. “You’ve got to fidget yourself into the right position by looking at the original picture you’ve taken and use reference points from it,” he says. To get a really precise match, Levene also plugged his camera into his computer at his tide-watching spot to overlay the original picture with the new image revealed by the camera.Crosby beach in Merseyside.

Whale experts said the animal appeared lost but seemed to be swimming strongly.British Divers Marine Life Rescue, which specialises in saving marine animals in distress in UK waters, has sent a specialist vet to the Kent town to monitor the whale’s movements.Julia Cable, the charity’s national coordinator, said: “It is swimming strongly and appears to be feeding, so there is no indication that it unwell or acting strangely. We are not particularly concerned about its welfare apart from the fact that it really shouldn’t be there.“We do have someone going down to keep an eye on it and report it. We are hoping it is not going to get in any trouble.”Cable pointed out that sightings of beluga whales in British waters were very rare and that she believed the last sighting was three years ago off the Northumberland coast. “They are an Arctic species so they usually swim around Greenland or Svalbard, a lot further north,” she said.Adult male beluga whales can grow to more than 5.5 metres (18ft) in length and weigh up to 1,900kg (4,190lb).Cable said it was possible the specimen in the Thames was forced south of its usual habitat by last week’s storms.Dave Andrews, a consultant ecologist, was one of the first to identify the whale while birdwatching near Coalhouse Fort in East Tilbury, Essex.Under a video posted on Twitter just after 11.30am, he wrote: “Can’t believe I’m writing this, no joke – beluga in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort. It’s been feeding around the barges for the last hour and hasn’t moved more than 200 metres in either direction.”By 3pm live helicopter footage of the scene showed a Port of London Authority (PLA) boat patrolling the estuary off Gravesend. The PLA confirmed there was a whale in the Thames and urged other boats to “keep a safe and respectful distance”.Marine mammal experts at the Natural History Museum in London initially said that clearer images were needed to definitely identify the whale as a beluga and that it could be another cetacean species with albinism.But after examining footage, its whale expert, Richard Sabin, said its appearance and behaviour suggested “very strongly” it was a beluga.Estuaries are one of the belugas’ favoured habitats, but they also live in deep ocean basins and among loose ice, the museum said.A spokesman for the RSPCA said: “We are working with other agencies to monitor the situation and ready to provide appropriate assistance if requested.”Danny Groves, from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: “This is a high Arctic species thousands of miles from where it should be in Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea. They are usually associated close to the ice. He or she is obviously very lost and quite possibly in trouble.”Groves urged potential onlookers to give the whale space and minimise disturbance. In 2006, a whale died after it swum up the Thames into central London, despite efforts to rescue the animal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e877b123cd522f0d4debdbe6b9dee1bcb4ee04f/0_196_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=741c0f5027ea05b889db0af1619e8fee","title":"saint laurent walks on water with paris show reflecting its rich past","story":"Label’s latest collection takes a cue from its founder’s gift of reimagining of classic codes to create something newSaint Laurent may have dropped the Yves off its name back in 2012, but the man himself continues to bear a heavy influence on current creative director Anthony Vaccarello, who was in a reflective mood at the label’s Paris fashion week show.Sending models out on to a catwalk platform of still water where they kicked up big splashes in their wake, the designer presented a collection for the French fashion house that took its cue from the brand’s eponymous founder’s gift of reimagining classic codes to create something new.He was inspired, he explained backstage afterwards, “by the way Paloma Picasso inspired Saint Laurent in the 70s, the way she took the clothes from the 40s and made them her own”. As such, 60s shift dresses with diamanté trim merged with suiting from the same era cut from the thick jersey that Saint Laurent also used when he first established his brand. The 70s were referenced in skin-tight tuxedo suiting worn sometimes with velvet blazers, and when not with waistcoats and ruffled shirts or pussy-bow blouses.Decoration came in the form of embellished and patchworked stars and hearts, reminiscent of the motifs Saint Laurent featured in his Love postcards from the 70s to the 00s – since reproduced into posters and seen in brasseries all over Paris – while the section of the show celebrated the late designer’s love affair with Marrakech through flowing kaftans and cutout swimwear. “I don’t want to say it’s another homage,” smiled Vaccarello. “But it’s another way to talk about all the things he did.”Hemlines were short and vamp appeal was high-wattage in this collection, which Vaccarello described as “a mix of everything”. Now into his fifth women’s ready-to-wear season for the brand, the 36-year-old Italian has created a distinctive aesthetic for the house. His super-short embellished dresses and exaggerated details hark back to the unabashed, more-is-more glamour of Saint Laurent’s most fruitful creative years without teetering over the edge into “too-much” territory. It’s an aesthetic that was set off by the location of this springsummer 2019 show.Vaccarello has a penchant for an extravaganza, and fresh from unveiling his first menswear show for the house in July against the Manhattan skyline in New York, the location of Tuesday evening’s show returned to its regular haunt, the Place du Trocadero.As tourists took a front-row seat on a wall opposite the runway – or stole an eyeful from the Big Bus double-decker that stopped as it passed – and with the Eiffel Tower twinkling in the background, towering white palm trees lined the liquid catwalk. “A touch of North Africa,” he explained.In his first interview since the appointment was announced, Slimane said: “A designer is someone who expresses himself authentically through what he feels. Each has his way to tell about his time.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d685c49e2dcf37a7272319329592df12ebf1ef4/0_332_3508_1712/master/3508.jpg?width=1900\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0a915889a77c5efbea995e386d8debda 3800w","title":"no different truths last years soviet film","story":"A new season at the Barbican tells the story of the USSR’s final generation through the lens of its pioneering film-makers“Young people are our big hope, but they spell trouble for us too.” In 1965, an administrator at the Leningrad film studio, Lenfilm, summed up an enduring dilemma for Soviet official culture. How could the Young Communist League (on paper a “public organisation”, in practice entirely subordinate to the party leadership) mobilise the younger generation without promoting political enthusiasms of the wrong kind? Soviet cinema – a young art form with particular appeal to the country’s youth – was, throughout its existence, a showcase for conflicted views of young people. Its own fate, too, altered as attitudes to them changed.In the first years after the October revolution, youth activism was strongly encouraged in life and on film. Sergei Eisenstein was just 27 when Battleship Potemkin, with its martyred young leader of a naval mutiny, made him world famous. But views of political participation by children and young people changed abruptly under Stalin. Eisenstein’s Bezhin Meadow, in which a tow-haired boy leads the assault on traditional village life, ran into trouble in August 1936. This came a month after a crackdown on child psychology, which was considered “perverted”, and at the point when patriotic values were returning to the school syllabus.Soviet film studios altered, too, turning into showcases for mature artists: the masters. In the late 1940s, film production stalled – a mere eight titles for the whole USSR were produced in 1951. Almost none of the state film school, VGIK’s graduates went on to make features. They toiled away directing documentaries, public interest movies and films for schools. Most were not even allowed to shoot footage while in college. Instead, graduating students sketched proposed shots and wrote pitches for films they would never be able to make.This changed dramatically under Nikita Khrushchev. The leader’s main goal was to remobilise communist values. But the political and social reforms of the day transformed the lives of young people and gave prominence to subcultures as well as sanctioning forms of collective activity. Expansion of the film industry brought hundreds of new film artists – screenwriters, camera and sound operators, designers as well as directors – into Soviet studios.Many cinema novices were young in an approximate sense – around 40. That still made them at least 20 years younger than the surviving masters from the Stalin era. Yet, cinematic youth was in no sense overawed by the generational gulf. Some had served at the front in the second world war. A good many had lost parents to political terror. Accelerated maturity and new expectations were the texture of the times. Movies about young people became central to the thaw and shifted the cinematic language – new body types and gestures, new kinds of emotional rhetoric, and dynamic, mobile styles of camerawork – went with the youth focus.The Brezhnev era was, in Mikhail Gorbachev’s words, “the period of stagnation”. However, the new emphasis on stability gave a paradoxical prominence to youth unrest as a symptom and cause of social anomie. Social deviance was far more prominent in 1970s and early 80s cinema than during the 50s and 60s. In this sense, glasnost under Gorbachev accelerated, rather than initiated, a stark view of Soviet reality.Until recently, the films of the USSR’s last decades were mainly a specialist interest. But that is starting to change. Earlier this year, London’s Regent Street Cinema presented the season Youth on the March! in association with the Russian film foundation Kino Klassika. This gave an exhilarating introduction to nine major films by young Soviet directors from the past 50 years, including Otar Ioseliani’s Falling Leaves, Kira Muratova’s Brief Encounters and Juris Podnieks’ Is it Easy to be Young?. This week, the Barbican’s Generations: Russian Cinema of Change in collaboration with New East Cinema show six more youth films.Half the movies in the Barbican season date from the post-Stalin era, underlining its transformational importance. There is Mikhail Kalik’s luminous testament to teenage friendship, Goodbye, Boys. And there is Dinara Asanova’s harsh yet lyrical 1983 portrait of a work camp for young offenders, Tough Kids.Asanova’s movie is particularly interesting. She was, like the young people she portrayed, a marginal figure, first as a woman director (one of only three in the new generation, alongside Muratova and Larisa Shepitko, to achieve renown). Her Kyrghyz origins – only two directors permanently based in Leningrad came from central Asia – also contributed to her outsider status. She had close ties with the cultural underground and shared its intense concern with the abject and the overlooked.Asanova disliked the category of “children’s film”. “I want to show that there are no different truths for different age groups,” she wrote in her notebooks. This determination to avoid patronising young people on screen went with working methods that were, in Soviet terms, unique.All Asanova’s movies, beginning with her first full-length feature, Woodpeckers Don’t Get Headaches, were filmed using improvisation – a considerable feat in a culture where scripts went through at least seven clearance readings and ergence from agreed texts could provoke uproar. Asanova treated each shoot as a way of establishing human and intellectual contact with everyone on set. She was deeply interested in western youth films and asked the state film board, Goskino, for permission (which was refused) to show the crew If … and A Clockwork Orange during the pre-production stage of Woodpeckers.At the start of her career, Asanova faced accusations of unprofessionalism and chaotic working methods. When complete – after extensive edits – Woodpeckers was placed in the third quality category, a “soft ban” that confined screenings to film clubs and venues in distant provinces. But by the early 1980s, five films on, Asanova had convinced her colleagues of her work methods as well as her talent, which helps explain why Lenfilm took the risk of making Tough Kids to begin with. “We know this film is going to be tricky at the start, and later on, too,” said Asanova’s editor, Frizhetta Gukasyan. With “eyes open to the inevitable”, the studio’s artistic management backed the director all the way.When Tough Kids was shown to Asanova’s close colleagues, there was silence. People were so moved they couldn’t put their reactions into words. A screening at Lenfilm’s chief vetting body, the Artistic Council, though, brought indignant objections on the grounds that the film was “too soft” on young criminals. Two recent high-profile street attacks by Moscow and Leningrad teenagers, leaving victims for dead, had made s of morality nervous. Goskino insisted on edits which took 100 extra days of filming. Eventually, Tough Kids cleared the state and party approval process. In 1985 – a sign of changing times – it was awarded a state prize.By then, Asanova was dead, at the age of 42. The human cost was high, not just for her. “Cinema is the blood that I suck from other people’s lives,” she wrote in her notebooks. Some of the young people she worked with, including her son Anvar, ended up shipwrecked, caught in the gulf between Asanova’s utopian view of the creative process and the rigidity of late Soviet social norms. But Tough Kids asks questions that were too often ignored in Russia and, indeed, in any society today.Tough Kids has explicit and subversive echoes of the most famous Soviet film about young offenders, Nikolai Ekk’s 1931 classic Road Into Life, shown on TV while Asanova’s movie was in production. Yet, with its documentary-style talking heads and delicate balance between nihilism and hope, it is more post-Soviet than Soviet.The leading directors of the past 30 years, including Aleksei Balabanov, also showcased by Generations, and Andrey Zvyagintsev, have dwelt extensively on violence by and to young people. But of all film-makers, Asanova had the closest contact with young people themselves. Tough Kids was their film, as well as hers. No wonder that after it came out, Asanova got a telephone call from a young woman she had never met. “Make a follow-up to Tough Kids. Please. But this time, call it Tough Girls.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0385d30aa0029354921b0160d790c8dec7677c2c/0_30_1399_839/master/1399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d53fe854081c979fbbd0a40bd0754ec","title":"jose mourinho paul pogba never captain manchester united","story":"• United manager unhappy with player’s performances• French midfielder wants the side to be more attackingJosé Mourinho has told Paul Pogba he will never captain Manchester United again, though the manager denied that there was any issue between him and the Frenchman.Pogba’s demotion emerged before United endured a shock defeat by Derby as they crashed out of the Carabao Cup here on Tuesday night. They lost 8-7 on penalties after a 2-2 draw, with Phil Jones’s kick saved by Scott Carson.Pogba was at the match and when Mourinho was asked if he had fallen out with him, the manager said: “The only truth is that I made the decision for Paul – not to be the second captain any more.“It was exactly the same person who decided Paul was the second captain – myself. No fallout at all, just decisions I do not have to explain.”Despite the denial, the move places the midfielder’s future at the club in serious doubt. Pogba was rested from the match-day squad before a defeat that will also place Mourinho under further scrutiny regarding the direction of the side and his own future.The 55-year-old’s decision regarding Pogba and the captaincy is the latest fracture in their relationship. Pogba has previously signalled a wish to leave and he could now be sold in January.Last season, Pep Guardiola revealed that Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola, informed the Manchester City manager the player would be interested in departing United for the champions during the winter window.Barcelona also made a £45m offer for Pogba in the summer, a bid that was rejected by United and may have been made due to encouragement from the player’s camp.Pogba had been given the armband by Mourinho for three matches this season in the absence of Antonio Valencia. He has performed erratically and after the 1-1 draw with Wolves at Old Trafford on Saturday seemed to question Mourinho’s tactics, stating that United should “attack, attack, attack” more.It followed Pogba saying after the opening-day win against Leicester that he would be fined for saying certain things, having returned a man‑of-the-match display.After Tuesday’s defeat Mourinho again questioned his players’ attitude. He said: “You know it happened that we didn’t score when we could and we could in the first half to kill it. We didn’t.“At half-time I repeated the words I said in the last match. Their dressing room is a dressing room with belief and we need to go and kill the game, which we didn’t.”Goals from Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini for United and Derby’s Harry Wilson – on loan from Liverpool, the Premier League leaders – and Jack Marriott had sent the tie to the shootout.Mourinho, though, denied any criticism of the team. “You say I criticise, I don’t,” he said. “I don’t think you are correct saying I am criticising the team. You want me to say we play a phenomenal match? The truth is the opponent in the second half started better than us, we responded at 1-1.“I would lie if I said we threw the match away. With a draw in the past you had 30 more minutes to play but without extra time you go straight to penalties and that goes against the team who with 30 extra minutes would win the match.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04b39b1d7dfa98743d66d0dac0ff77a648c2b429/41_96_3581_2148/master/3581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20929d27a4d34b558298aeecb487a044","title":"manchester united derby county carabao cup match report","story":"On a day when José Mourinho and Paul Pogba’s relationship hit rock bottom came a testing night for the Portuguese as Derby County knocked Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup.Phil Jones saw his kick saved by Scott Carson and given Mourinho’s ongoing discontent with Pogba, plus a defeat that adds to United’s drift, the manager will come under further scrutiny.Jack Marriott’s late header had been answered by Marouane Fellaini’s in injury time after United had ceded the initiative following Juan Mata’s early goal. In the second half a Harry Wilson equaliser was followed by Sergio Romero becoming the third United player in five matches to receive a red card – for handling the ball outside the area on 67 minutes – before Fellaini’s intervention seem to have saved home blushes.This was a famous win for Derby and a particularly sweet one for the manager, Frank Lampard, who spoke before of his admiration for Mourinho, under whom he enjoyed glittering success at Chelsea.Mourinho made nine changes, retaining only Romelu Lukaku and Jesse Lingard from Saturday’s draw here with Wolves. Pogba was among those missing, although he was one of a number of players the manager stated was rested.Lampard’s XI was the same as that beat Brentford 3-1 last time out yet any hope of a famous win was dented after three minutes following a flowing move.Anthony Martial showed his class with a neat first touch and raced down the left. A cross was flicked on by Lukaku, Lingard dummied, and Mata swept past Carson.The perfect start for United came close to being matched by Derby. As United dawdled Mason Bennett’s effort required a fine save from Romero.Next came a moment of United quality. Ashley Young, wearing the armband, pinged in a sweet 40-yard pass that bypassed the visiting defence and landed on Mata’s toes. The No 8 killed the ball but could not beat Carson and a corner from the left ensued.Young took this and saw his delivery ricochet off Carson’s right post in a fortunate escape for Derby. The sense of an open contest in which United might streak ahead at this point was confirmed when Richard Keogh made a serious error in front of Carson. He gave the ball away to Lukaku, yet after racing in on goal his attempt went wide. Derby’s response came via a Keogh advance from the back but the central defender’s 20-yard shot missed to Romero’s right.Martial was unlucky to be dropped for the Wolves game following an eye-catching display against Young Boys and he was in effervescent mood again here. After skipping to near the left byline he crossed and Lukaku might have doubled the lead but the centre-forward mistimed his jump and over went the header.Keogh continued to make errors. Just before the half-hour the captain dawdled and looked to have given possession away again in the danger zone but he managed to recover. Unlike Lampard, who stood throughout the opening period, Mourinho waited 31 minutes before leaving his seat and when he did this was to remonstrate at some lax play from the team. The Portuguese was also frustrated that United had not been more ruthless – a regular refrain of his – as at the break their lead remained just the single goal.As this juncture neared Martial advanced and looked to thread the ball to Lukaku who lurked near the penalty spot but he lacked precision just as the side had thus far lacked the killer edge.The second half began with Lukaku having to head clear a Derby free-kick and Romero hitting a regulation clearance against an opposing player and the visitors winning a corner moments later.This United performance was beginning to be reminiscent of Saturday’s slipshod display and of so many under Mourinho. Derby were becoming the ascendant side and Romero was again required to protect the lead as more schoolboy marking allowed Wilson in though the wide man could not beat the Argentinian.United were unable to get hold of the ball and dictate the contest and when Johnson flew into Martial with a tackle near halfway this summed up how much more urgent Derby were.This all pointed to what came on the hour. Wilson, a Liverpool loanee, stepped up to take a 30-yard free-kick that he curled from right to left, sending Romero the wrong way for a memorable equaliser.Mourinho reacted instantly. He took off Lingard and Ander Herrera for Fred and Fellaini yet the travelling support’s own response was to inform the 55-year-old he was “getting sacked in the morning”.Now came disaster for United as Romero was sent off by the referee, Stuart Atwell, for handling outside the area as Wilson raced on to the ball. This meant Lee Grant – who played for Derby for 11 years in two spells, with more than 170 appearances – entering for his United debut at the age of 35 to set up a frantic finish, which included one fine save.Now came the final whistle, Mourinho’s misery and Lampard’s joy. The latter said: “I’m shell-shocked. To go down early at Old Trafford and play as well as they did was superb. I am a proud manager. It was the easiest selection I have had. The players were superb against Brentford and they deserved the chance to play at Old Trafford. I wanted to bring a team who could really compete.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f0085915876cf7b6775c8761068e4bf8c4a90f9/0_145_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=151d343dc46912da499527f39e0c1c12","title":"mauricio pochettino spurs new stadium christmas","story":"• Pochettino has had updates from the chairman Daniel Levy• Spurs manager looking for win against Watford in Carabao CupMauricio Pochettino says he is “confident” Tottenham will move into their new stadium before Christmas, after he held talks with Daniel Levy.As he prepares to play a “home” Carabao Cup tie against Watford in Milton Keynes, the Tottenham manager believes the end is finally in sight for the £850m project after the planned opening this month was postponed over safety fears. Pochettino says victory in the third-round match would be a show of gratitude to frustrated Spurs fans who have now gone 500 days without a game in their own ground.The match on Wednesday, against a Watford side who have already beaten Spurs this season, was rehoused at Stadium MK after Spurs’ temporary home of Wembley Stadium was unable to accommodate the fixture because of the title fight between Anthony Joshua and Alexander Povetkin last weekend. Watford were believed to have been disappointed with the decision to play at Stadium MK and have not taken up their full ticket allocation. With Spurs fans also seemingly reluctant to make the round trip, predictions suggest the 30,000-capacity stadium could be only half full.“Of course we feel sorry for the fans who are going to move one hour and a half maybe to Milton Keynes,” Pochettino said. “But that is a circumstance we need to adapt to. If we want to have one of the best stadiums in the world our fans need to understand that this situation happened and we cannot change the reality.“We are going to try to win. And of course the fans are the most important in football. They consume football. We have the salary we have because football is the most watched sport in the world. That is thanks to the fans. The fans are doing a massive effort. It’s fantastic when 2,000 or 3,000 go to Milan. We are so grateful. Of course we are going to try to give the victory for the fans.”As for Watford’s concerns, however, Pochettino was more brusque. “I don’t care if they are happy or not happy,” he said. “What can we do if we cannot play at Wembley or at our new stadium? Maybe the Watford fans are not happy but I think the people at Watford understand we had to find another venue to play. The draw was Tottenham v Watford.”Pochettino offered a last thought on the new White Hart Lane, saying when it finally opens his team will no longer have an excuse for not winning trophies. “First of all we need to finish the stadium and build the trophy cabinet,” the 46-year-old said. “And when all is ready and settled is the moment to say ‘we can win now’."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a02d5bf9572e2d84a70a6e30b2a6b56beab0d019/0_122_4286_2571/master/4286.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b736353f1039863c398a9a937e4831b6","title":"oxford united manchester city carabao cup match report","story":"A routine victory for the Carabao Cup holders delivered a memorable storyline for Phil Foden, who scored the first of what will surely be many goals in a Manchester City shirt on a landmark night for the 18-year-old.His emotional celebration showed just how much the goal meant to him, even if it was scored in front of a car park, and he also set up Riyad Mahrez with an exquisite pass for City’s second as well as having a hand in the opener.It was some performance from Foden, who was making his 14th appearance for City and starting for the fifth time. It prompted Karl Robinson, Oxford’s manager, to use the word “genius” afterwards and draw comparisons with Andrés Iniesta. “We planned to press, and after three and a half minutes three of our players pressed him and I blinked and he was through them,” Robinson said. “He has feet to die for.”Asked about any parallels with Iniesta, Pep Guardiola baulked a little and replied: “Andrés is a big, big word. But I said many times that we’re delighted with Phil. The way he celebrated his first goal, it was like the final of the World Cup, but that’s because he’s a City fan – he loves to play for the club. He’s an exceptional young player and for the next decade Manchester City will have an amazing player.“I’m not going to say he’s going to become Andrés Iniesta, because that will put a lot of pressure on him and Andrés is by far one of the best players I ever saw in my life.“But we are so satisfied Phil’s part of the group. He arrived last season and we showed him he was special and that’s why we decided not to buy any attacking midfielders, or people in that position, because we have Phil.“He belongs in our team and he will have his minutes. When he plays, he always plays good. He made an amazing pass for the first goal, the ball to Riyad for the second and finished off the third goal so good. He has a mentality to score goals.”Foden seized his chance on a night when Guardiola made 10 changes to the side who thumped Cardiff on Saturday, with Nicolás Otamendi the only survivor. Aro Muríc made his City debut in goal, Danilo played for the first time since the World Cup, and Oleksandr Zinchenko was hugely impressive at left-back.If that makes it sound like it was an experimental lineup, there was still plenty of experience on the pitch from the start, including Vincent Kompany and John Stones, who played in a deep‑lying midfield role that gave David Silva and Foden the freedom to roam.Oxford had their work cut out and the only surprise was that it took 36 minutes for City to break the deadlock. Gabriel Jesus headed in that goal from three yards out, after Brahim Díaz’s shot was deflected, but it was the raking diagonal pass from Foden in the build up that caught the eye.The through ball that released Mahrez, 12 minutes from time, was even better. Mahrez finished emphatically and any lingering hopes that Oxford, who are second from bottom in League One, had of going to penalties.Foden, however, was not finished. Set up by the substitute Raheem Sterling, he arrowed a left‑foot shot into the far corner from 10 yards out and ran off in the direction of the City fans, kissing the badge on his shirt before sliding on his knees."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12dbf3a5319672c9a96c7179dd8ed47dfaf7618a/73_0_2629_1578/master/2629.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82db5019d7ea2942f17382733552503c","title":"manchester united v derby county carabao cup clockwatch live","story":"Frank Lampard’s Derby shocked Manchester United at Old Trafford while, slightly lower down the shock scale, Burnley lost to BurtonRight, I’m done here. Here’s another link to the match report. It’s been a blast. Bye!Before that interview, on Sky they were watching and discussing Harry Wilson’s free kick. Darren Bent declared it the best free-kick he has ever seen. Then he is shown a similar effort by Cristiano Ronaldo when the Portuguese was at Old Trafford. Suddenly Wilson’s isn’t so great after all. “I think I like Ronaldo’s,” he says.You know, what happened that we didn’t score when we could, and we could in the first half, we had good situations to kill it. We didn’t, and at half-time I repeat the same words I say in the last match, saying their dressing-room was a dressing-room with belief and we need to go and to kill the game, which we didn’t. We couldn’t be dominant in the beginning of the second half and only after their equaliser we had again that reaction. I prefer to be proactive and to go for it, but we go for it only after the 1-1. After the red card we were in a bit of difficulty but even with one man less it was a reaction of pride. Then the penalties come and somebody has to miss. When I saw going after the sixth, the seventh, I knew we were going to be in trouble with Jones, with Eric. I knew we were in trouble then.Finally, he’s asked about stories that he has fallen out with Paul Pogba and stripped him of the vice-captaincy:The only truth is I made the decision of Paul not to be the second captain any more. But no fall-out, no problem. I am the manager, I can make these decisions. No problem at all, no fall-out at all, just a decision that I don’t have to explain.After José Mourinho told Paul Pogba he will never be captain again came a night to test the manager as a Phil Jones’s miss from Manchester United’s eighth kick in the penalty shootout sent Derby County through and knocked United out of the Carabao Cup.More from Old Trafford:A bit more from Lamps:The next test is consistency. The next test is Bolton at the weekend. We have to do that regularly, because we want to get up to the Premier League. We’ve found out that if you don’t turn up or if you lack the intensity that we had tonight, you’ll lose games. My job is to get them up and going again but I haven’t got a problem with that.I’m a bit shell-shocked. What a performance from the team, and in terms of personality to go 1-0 down early on, toplay the way they did, to get back into the game, to get ahead, and then there’s six minutes of extra time. To have the personality, to stand up and take the penalties. I’m just a proud manager.The players were so good against Brentford I felt they deserved it. The 11 players who started deserved to go again. I wanted to bring a team here to really compete. I’m just so proud of them.The scoreline was nothing like as emphatic as many had predicted, or probably feared in the case of Oxford United’s supporters, but there was never the slightest doubt that Manchester City would take their place in the next round of the competition they won back in February. Gabriel Jesus’s second goal of the season, followed by a third in four days for Riyad Mahrez, allowed City to brush aside Oxford before Phil Foden scored in injury time.More from the Kassam Stadium:A couple of Derby players have had a quick chat. First Harry Wilson, scorer of a wonderful free-kick:We wanted to come here, play our football and go toe to toe with United, and we’ve done that and come out on top. It was one of them. It was a bit far out to maybe curl it so I just put my laces through it and get a bit of movement. Thankfully I’ve done that and it nestled in the far corner. We got confidence from the way we played first half. We grew into the game and I thought we deserve to get our equaliser and then to go ahead. And Jack Marriott, who scored what looked like a winner but then wasn’t:I did think I’d scored the winner, but the game’s never done until the final whistle goes. But to win it on penalties was just as sweet. He’s got us playing, we’re playing with confidence and we back our ability whenever we step on the pitch. We’re all celebrating together and that shows what a tight-knit group we are.It was a moment to further age the hard-bitten souls in attendance. In the 81st minute of this Carabao Cup tie, Slavisa Jokanovic sent on Harvey Elliott for his professional debut.

But is it really that easy to turn your back on jealousy? And what about all the admin?Alex Sanson is nervous. She is hosting a dinner party this Friday, and wants it to go well, because her lovers are coming – all of them. “Cooking for one person you fancy is hard enough, but three of them is even more stressful!” says Sanson, who has brown hair, an open, friendly face and a bookish air..Sanson is polyamorous, meaning that she has multiple romantic and sexual partners, all of whom are aware of the others’ existence. Currently, the 28-year-old is in a “polycule” with three other people: William, Mike and Laura, all of whom are also dating the other members of the polycule.Dinner-party jitters aside, things are going swimmingly for Sanson, who works in marketing. “There’s so much joy in being poly,” she says. “It’s lovely not to burden one person with all your stuff. You just spread it all out.”Polyamory, also known as consensual non-monogamy, seems to be growing in popularity among young people, though with no definitive figures it’s hard to know how much of this is a matter of increased visibility. It comes in many shapes and forms, from open relationships (where in layperson’s terms you “cheat” on your partner, but they are aware and do not mind, and do the same to you), to solo polyamory, where you identify as polyamorous, but are not currently in multiple relationships. But all those involved reject monogamy as stifling, or oppressive, or simply not to their taste.“It’s not as complicated as people make it sound,” Sanson insists. If you are unsure whether polyamory might suit you, try this simple thought experiment: does the thought of your partner in the first flushes of romantic ardour with another person fill you with contentment, lust, indifference, or murderous rage? If it’s the last one, best to swerve polyamory. (There’s a term for the warm feeling polyamorous people experience when seeing their partners with someone else: compersion.)“I’ve had people saying to me, ‘You just want to fuck about!’” says 29-year-old Calum James, who identifies as a heteroflexible pansexual solo polyamorous relationship anarchist. What this basically means is that James, who is mostly straight, is not currently in a polyamorous relationship with a person or persons. If he were, he would regard it as no more important than non-intimate friendships, because relationship anarchists treat romantic and non-romantic relationships the same.“I had one woman have a go at me, saying, ‘It’s an awful way to treat women,’” James says. “But people don’t understand it’s not just about meeting women and having sex with them. I want to build deep connections with people and see them regularly. I just don’t want those connections to follow the same rules as traditional relationships.”James tried monogamy, but found it “suffocating”. “I never understood monogamy, even when I was a kid. I’d think, ‘I fancy three people in my class.’”“The thing I’ve always disliked about monogamy and marriage,” Sanson adds, “is the idea of owning another person and them being your other half or somehow completing you, like you weren’t complete before you met them. What I love about polyamory is that I’m my own person and no one owns me. I don’t own any of you, either. We’re all free.”Polyamory is having a cultural moment right now, with celebrities such as Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith speaking about being non-monogamous, and the BBC drama Wanderlust depicting a middle-class couple as they open up their relationship. As anyone who lived through the 1960s, or who is from the LGBT community will tell you, polyamory is not new: free love or non-monogamy has been practised for years. But polyamory is now being adopted by people who might have been monogamous five or 10 years ago, not least because the internet makes it easier than ever for poly-curious people to educate themselves about polyamory, and connect with like-minded iniduals.“Things are changing rapidly,” says Janet Hardy, the co-author of the polyamory handbook The Ethical Slut. “More people are getting the idea that it’s possible to be happy and healthy without being monogamous. What I’m seeing among young people is that they don’t have the same need to self-define by what they like to do in bed, or in relationships, like my generation did. Everything’s out on a big buffet, and they try a little of everything.”Polyamorous people reject the end game of romantic monogamy, and disdain so-called “relationship escalators”: society’s expectation that couples will cycle through #putaringonit selfies, marriage and kids. Instead, they let their relationships flow whither the current takes them, relinquishing themselves to the whorls and eddies that change all romantic partnerships over time. In our increasingly precarious times, it makes sense that polyamory is popular. “Growing up, you’re bombarded by all this messaging about what the perfect relationship set-up is,” Sanson says. “You’re going to have a family and buy a house and do this and that. But a lot of that isn’t relevant to my generation.”Still, being polyamorous isn’t just a carefree romp. It requires you to unpick the messy yarn of human emotion, and that most familiar knot of all: jealousy. Perhaps the biggest myth of all about polyamorous people is that they don’t feel jealousy. “Jealousy is a part of human nature,” says 27-year-old William Jeffrey, a member of Sanson’s polycule. “You still feel it. But I’ve found with every jealousy I’ve ever had while being polyamorous, I’ve been able to trace the jealousy back to an insecurity about myself. When I figure out what the insecurity is, I can overcome it.”A responsible polyamorous partner accepts the other person’s jealousy. “When I started dating someone else, my partner Laura expressed that she was feeling jealous,” says Mike Scoins, 28, also in the polycule. “So I told her: ‘I acknowledge your feelings. Can we unpack the fear that is underlying your jealousy?’ In this instance, it was something along the lines of: ‘Do you still care about me?’ When you provide reassurance that, yes, absolutely, I do still care, the jealousy dissipates.”Is jealousy only ever the result of insecurity? “I’d say that’s too simplistic a view,” says Hardy. “I don’t think there’s one emotion you can call jealousy. I think jealousy is an umbrella we put over all of the emotions we find difficult that we want to quell by changing someone else’s behaviour.” In her introduction-to-polyamory workshops, Hardy asks participants to write a thank-you note to their jealousy. “It exists for a reason. Jealousy tries to protect you from something.”Can you really vanquish the green-eyed monster with introspection and communication alone? “Some people are more prone to jealousy, and some people are less prone to it,” Hardy says. “If polyamory sounds unpleasant, don’t do it! There are no merit badges here.”“I don’t really experience sexual jealousy,” Scoins muses. “My one experience of jealousy was when my then partner had two tickets for a ball and didn’t give me one.”There’s a joke about polyamory: it didn’t take off until Google Calendar was invented. The polyamorous people I interview effortlessly manage packed schedules. Jeffrey, for instance, will meet once a week to play a Buffy the Vampire Slayer role-playing game with Scoins and the fourth member of their polycule, Laura Nevo. He also has a weekly date night with his live-in partner, as well as seeing Sanson and Nevo once a week.While shows such as Wanderlust depict polyamory as a tumescent bonk-fest, in reality polyamorous people spend most of their time doing the deeply unsexy business of talking about their feelings. Sanson credits polyamory with giving her more emotional self-awareness. “Polyamory has allowed me to be more introspective, think about the motives behind what I’m doing, identify emotions more accurately and be explicit about how I’m feeling about things.”Polyamory tends to unnerve people, affronting expectations of traditional romantic monogamy. It’s harder for polyamorous people to date: apps such as Tinder or Bumble don’t have options for non-monogamous people, for instance. When James writes in his Tinder bio that he is non-monogamous, he experiences a “significant dip in matches”. And when he tells prospective romantic partners he is polyamorous, it rarely goes down well. “One date told me, ‘I was really interested in you until you told me that.’”Last New Year’s Eve, James went to a party in Sheffield, where he lives. When he walked in, heads swivelled. “They all went: ‘Is that the polyamorous one?’” James is weary of having to defend his way of life, and rightly so: consenting adults shouldn’t have to justify their sex lives to judgmental strangers. “Some people don’t recognise that what’s not right for them isn’t not right for other people,” he says. “I try to point out that it’s not harming anybody if it’s all open and honest.”And monogamous people can learn from polyamory. Twenty-three-year-old Aliyah, who uses theythem pronouns, was polyamorous, but is currently in a monogamous relationship. They credit polyamory with giving them a healthier outlook on monogamy. “The way I was taught monogamy wasn’t healthy,” Aliyah says. “I’d have this constant paranoia of being cheated on.”Polyamory made them better at monogamy. “I learned that monogamy doesn’t have to be as strict as we conceptualise it growing up,” they explain. “Before I felt that deep love should only be reserved for romantic connections. But being polyamorous taught me I have so much love for my friends, and that doesn’t have to be explored in a sexual context.”As polyamory becomes more visible, it won’t be seen as such a tear in our social fabric, but as an ordinary and unremarkable thing. This will be down to the efforts of a new generation who are normalising their freedom to live and love how they want, without nose-wrinkling or head-shaking.“My dad said to me to me the other day, ‘I’m worried about your emotional wellbeing, because you’re building relationships with these people,’” Sanson laughs. “And I was like, ‘I know! That’s the whole point.”Chiara Giovanni, 24, is in a relationship with two people. Her partner Aditya Sharad, 23, is monogamous.Chiara: I always struggled with monogamy and found it quite restrictive. Even though I was super-happy in my relationships, I wasn’t able to be monogamous and faithful. I decided to take a different tack. When I met Aditya I thought, I love this person and want to make them happy, and I need to do this differently. So I was open from the start.Ninety per cent of polyamory is talking. Sometimes I think, I want to watch a movie! I don’t want to talk about our relationship again. But it’s important to be able to express your fears, rather than waiting for the worst thing to happen.I definitely think more people would be polyamorous if they knew what polyamory was, and that it wasn’t just a phase, but valid and long-term and serious. Right now, I’m setting up a time for Aditya to meet my other partner, who is based in the US. They are both super-nervous and really want the other person to like them. It’s really cute.Aditya: At first, when a partner says, “I don’t think conventional relationship settings are working for me,” it’s hard to hear. While Chiari and I decided it would be a polyamorous relationship, I’m not a hugely social person, so it didn’t make a lot of sense for me to have multiple relationships. At the same time, I have a wonderful relationship with Chiara, who I really love. So I thought, let’s give this a try.Jealousy is never the main feeling. Something may trigger the jealousy, but it’s not a primary feeling. You’ll be feeling insecure about something, and that’s what the jealousy is about. You have to communicate about your feelings, and accept you’re not going to be given all the time and attention in your relationship.I do feel fulfilled. I wouldn’t have chosen to be poly myself, but I value Chiara. We have a joyous and uplifting relationship. So it’s not like her being polyamorous is a necessary evil. I’m just invested in what allows us to lead a life together, and what is important to her, and makes her happy.If you’d told me about polyamory eight years ago I’d have been like, “What, really, that works?” But it does. You need to be intentional about it, but it can work.Laura Nevo, 30, is part of a four-person polycule, along with William Jeffrey, Alex Sanson, and Mike Scoins.I started polyamory as an experiment. I had been in monogamous relationships all my life, and when I met my partner Mike he was honest with me. He said: “I like you, but I’m going to carry on dating other people.” I thought, fair enough. I did some research into polyamory and began to date multiple people. In previous monogamous relationships, I’d cheat on my partners and feel guilty about it. I didn’t want that to happen again.I’ve been dating Mike for two years and William for one year. I also hang out a lot with Alex, and there are other people I may have sex with. It gives me a lot of happiness to see my partners together, like William and Mike for example. It’s nice to be able to be happy for someone else, without having to be a part of their happiness.Recently, I had a challenge because one of my partners became involved with someone I really didn’t connect with. I’m trying to work through that and not bottle things up. I used to suffer from anxiety and low self-esteem, but I’ve found that polyamory helps me a lot, as I have to really figure things out.When someone new comes into our polycule, I’m extra careful of things. I think, how can we deal with this new person? How can we make them comfortable? Because it’s not nice to feel left out.Being polyamorous has felt freeing for me. It has allowed me to meet people I wouldn’t have considered as partners before. I’ve been playing more on the gender spectrum. If I were to go back to monogamy one day, I think the experience of being polyamorous would make me more accepting of people and different types of relationships.Andrea, 30, believes in ‘free and independent agency’Coming out as non-monogamous is a very slow process, because it’s so hard to bring yourself to a point where you know that the other person might terminate the relationship. Some choose to cheat, but I wanted to be open to the person I loved.When I came out as non-monogamous to my girlfriend at the time, she basically said: “I didn’t sign up for this. Why can’t I have the person I met back?” That really hurt, because I never wanted to cause her pain. But I can’t help being myself. We tried to make it work, but eventually we parted ways, because she was monogamous and I wasn’t. Everything else in the relationship worked, so that was really painful.It’s important to be open and communicate about anyone new coming into the scene. If I’m at a party and I meet someone I want to bring home, I text Anita, who I have a romantic and sexual relationship with, and let her know. And my secret tool is Google Calendar. If I’m on a date and Anita wants to hang out, she can just check my calendar for the next available slot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcd9fa67f97dfde718ef2922bcb1a48be7a896a9/0_1751_3744_2247/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de9472ce884e043d40034a5ed6b8b7e1","title":"yoga adriene mishler youtube interview","story":"With 4 million subscribers and hundreds of thousands more watching free weekly videos, Yoga with Adriene is a social media sensation. What makes her fans so devoted?There are more than 2,400 people in the main hall of Alexandra Palace in north London, breathing in unison. “Take the deepest breath you’ve taken all day,” says the woman at the front, “and let it out through the mouth.” Lungs empty en masse. It feels like we’re in the belly of a beast.The woman is 33-year-old yogi and actor Adriene Mishler, and this is the largest live yoga class she has ever held – she is more frequently to be found teaching alone in front of her camera at home in Austin, Texas, than IRL. And it is this intimate version of her that 4 million subscribers to her Yoga with Adriene YouTube channel have come to know and share their homes with. Her particularly popular videos – “Yoga Morning Fresh”, for instance, or “7-Minute Bedtime Yoga” – can get upwards of 2 million viewers. Search “yoga” on Google, and Adriene dominates.“You just want to be her friend,” says Magdalena Krohn, a 32-year-old teacher and performance artist who is at the Ally Pally event, queueing for a cashew curry. Karen Bradley, a 56-year-old health visitor, has travelled from Sheffield to see Adriene. Fifty-year-old civil servant Julie Ashen says she is “not that brilliant with people”, but has nevertheless travelled from Swansea to see Adriene in this setting. You must love her, I say. “I do. She’s quite a phenomenon.”When I tell friends I am meeting Adriene, they get a zealous look in their eyes: “I’m not hyperbolising when I say she changed my life,” more than one confesses – and I know they’re not, because she changed mine, too. Maybe it’s simplistic, but there is a lot to be said for being gently cajoled into focusing on the feeling of the soles of your feet on the yoga mat, when anxious thoughts have been jolting like runaway trains through your mind all day.We meet the day before the event, over an on-brand turmeric latte in an east London cafe. In real life, Adriene is as enthusiastic as her on-screen self – peppy yet sage, welcoming and warm. I mention this special alchemy that has fans talking about her as if she’s a friend. “Yeah, and we are,” she says immediately, as though she feels it too. “Whenever I meet people, I’m always like: ‘Holy shit, it’s such an honour – I get to be in people’s homes, their most vulnerable place.’” Her chat is peppered with talk of blessings and angels, but I would challenge even the most cynical-hearted not to want to get a second round of lattes in.She has a snort-out-loud sense of humour, with a confidence she attributes to a childhood raised by “creative hippies”.“Find what feels good” has been her motto ever since she started in 2012 – her followers recite it with almost evangelical fervour. This approach is part of what has drawn the numbers to her videos, and crowds to north London despite the £40 ticket price – as well as to the other stops on this European tour, which includes free classes. For Krohn, “Adriene was the first teacher who really got me to understand that yoga was about more than just physical flexibility or that kind of ego-driven thing that goes with modern yoga.” Bradley came to yoga because she has arthritis – Adriene has, she says, helped her find some acceptance: “This is where you are … you can still do things but don’t push it, find what you can do.”Practising at home has obvious advantages – people cite cheapness, struggling to get to a studio because of health issues and fitting quick sessions in around family life. Adriene’s focus is on accessibility yoga for all. You could question the altruism – as with any personality on YouTube, she earns revenue from her well-watched channel (the analytics firm Social Blade puts the brand’s annual earnings at up to £284,000). She has a sponsorship deal with Adidas, and  subscribers willing to pay $9.99 (£7.50) a month to access extra content on her Find What Feels Good site. But with millions of people able to access her yoga for free, I’ll get to critiques of her motivation once I’ve untangled from pigeon pose.Yoga is a booming industry – last year, the market was worth $80bn (£74bn) globally. Once a trailblazer, Adriene is now one of a host of online yoga teachers bringing an ancient practice to a mass, modern audience. “There are a lot of people who think it’s a little bit questionable,” she concedes. “I get why people from India are going: ‘Hey, what the hell are you doing?’” Cultural appropriation is a criticism she has seen levelled at a lot of American teachers and one that she thinks, to an extent, is fair. Has she ever been criticised herself? “I don’t actually get it that much and the only times I do, I can tell that person’s never done any of my videos. They’re lumping me in because I’m white, wearing Adidas pants.” She has, she says, “tried to teach the real traditional style yoga … I really want to honour the philosophy.”But that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been room for some online savvy. Her business partner, Chris Sharpe, who she met on the set of a horror film and who had previously produced the successful YouTube series Hilah Cooking, was aware of the need to push the videos up the search engine rankings. It made for knotty decisions. “I did not want to call anything ‘yoga for weight loss’ in the beginning,” she says. But they struck a deal and tried it: “It did so disgustingly well.”They started to play around and chose words they knew would rank highly. She cites a video called Six Pack Abs. “Is that what we abide by and are six-pack abs really possible for women? Nooooo. Anatomically, it’s just ridiculous. But I’m kind of making fun of it.” In the video, she begins in the persona of a dumbbell-bunny, before quickly caving: “Just kidding, if you know me at all I don’t really subscribe to that obsession.” If you’re not familiar with her shtick, you could be forgiven for thinking it a cynical move to get the ratings up. But she is no stranger to body-image issues herself, mentioning that before auditions, she has felt a pressure to diet.Even now, she says being “on YouTube, in tight clothing” means she has had to work hard to avoid feeling the same pressures. Instead, she says she wants to “get people closer to experiencing pure love and acceptance for themselves. She sees these video titles, antithetical to her message, as Trojan horses, bringing people to her channel so she can deliver her alternative: “You can look good all you want, but if you’re still looking in the mirror and not loving who you see, we have it backwards.” It might sound schmaltzy written down, but it is clearly a much-needed message.So why yoga, and why now? It is irresistible to link turbulent times with a practice that can help you feel grounded. I try to make it that neat: has she seen an uptick in numbers on her channels since Trump took office, say? “I don’t know how the numbers have changed in terms of big shifts in politics,” she says, “but I do know that as a woman and as a human living in this time, I feel it.” And she clearly wants her yoga to cut through. She weighs up the next words, almost egging herself on: “I want all the people who voted for Trump to do my yoga. I want all the people who battle with the experience of racism to do yoga.” There’s that yoga for all message again.Her mother is Mexican, and in recent years Adriene has been embracing her heritage more. “Not that I’ve ever tried to hide it – hell no,” she says. “But I wasn’t raised bilingual and I happen to be fair-skinned. Then I had a moment a couple of years ago when I was like: ‘Shoooot, I’m Mexican and nobody knows it.’” She is learning Spanish: “My goal is to be able to do a playlist on my channel that’s all yoga español.”Her brand’s meteoric rise has undoubtedly been helped by the boom in the global wellness industry – estimated in 2015 to be worth nearly $4tn – and Adriene knows it. “I’d be lying if I didn’t say Chris anticipated this … he had the idea of creating something in the world of wellness for a reason.”As for the recent politicisation of the wellness industry, especially in reaction to the more elitist side of it, “I just think that it’s like everything – it’s really not about what you’re putting out there, it’s about how you’re doing it. We’re saying we want everyone to feel good, and yet we’re insinuating the only way to do that is if you have enough money to buy this $65 detox tea, and then it comes in the mail and you’re like: ‘What the fuck, I could make this.’” It’s not something she’s immune to, either: “Hell yeah, I’ve Gooped.”Which is why, she says, she has started to care about the numbers – “It gives me more power to be, like, the people’s yogi.”Back in the hall of Ally Pally, we’re finishing the evening’s practice by hugging ourselves – yes, you read right. Adriene cracks a joke and then we’re all breathing in unison again, like one big, collective lung."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8752e683f22b55c42b6b8059cdf9204518f0bfab/64_0_1913_1148/master/1913.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad09aeced02899812a61b0ec6d6259ac","title":"bbc two first full rebrand 25 years","story":"Channel also working with Black Mirror writer Charlie Brooker to develop new showsBBC Two is being completely rebranded for the first time in more than 25 years as the channel looks to reinvent itself in the face of threats from streaming services such as Netflix.The channel’s controller, Patrick Holland, also confirmed BBC Two was working with the Black Mirror creator, Charlie Brooker, to develop new programmes, and revealed Eva Green, Eve Hewson, and Marton Csokas would star in a big-budget adaptation of Eleanor Catton’s Booker prize-winning novel The Luminaries.Holland said traditional television channels still had enormous influence and he could offer a “curated channel in an age where you’ve got all of this choice”. But with the average age of a BBC Two viewer now in their 60s, the channel was facing up to the need to reach a younger audience, he said.The BBC is facing growing pressure from streaming services that are able to outspend it, with the director general, Tony Hall, saying the corporation needed more cash to maintain the current quality of programmes.BBC Two has already refocused its budget towards its primetime output but Holland said his channel’s ability to broadcast to millions of people on any given evening meant it could still set the tone of the national debate. “Netflix cannot do that, Amazon cannot do that. An ongoing schedule gives you an ongoing dialogue with the audience. I wouldn’t swap that for anything.”As part of the revamp, BBC Two will on Thursday drop its on-screen identity based around physical representations of the number two, which it has used in various forms since the early 90s. This will be replaced by a series of colourful visualisations based on a simple curve, which the controller said represented the channel’s “constant evolution, constant eclecticism, constant sense of quality”. It is also easier to rework and cheaper to create than the old branding.Holland said Brooker, whose Black Mirror series recently won an Emmy, was working on new projects. “He’s still working for us. There are things cooking. They haven’t finished cooking yet. They’re still in development,” he said.Other programmes heading to the channel include Riz Ahmed’s Englistan, which will tell the story of three generations of a British Pakistani family the “quite pricey” drama MotherFatherSon starring Richard Gere and a new documentary series charting the rise of Syria’s ruling Assad family.The controller said he was no longer interested in commissioning celebrity-fronted documentaries, which have clogged up schedules for years. “That sense of being told things by presenters in a traditional way is something we’ve moved on from. When you’re immersed in the story and able to make some connections yourself, it’s more grownup television and more emotionally engaging.”He also said contestants on University Challenge needed to be aware of the risk of social media abuse before going on the BBC Two quiz show. “The most important aspect of duty of care is talking through all the things that could happen and then it’s their choice whether they want to consent.”As part of the rebrand Holland is looking to work with Esme Wren, the editor of Newsnight, to “reinvigorate” the current affairs programme and make sure it fits better with the rest of the BBC Two schedule, such as by theming discussions around documentaries.“My role on BBC Two is to try and make the channel as engaged with the modern world, to make it engaged in the big questions of our time, but to do it in a way that brings extraordinary storytelling to the fore,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da20fba01fbe2655e56db5e522b2dc51e7fd3f3d/0_240_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e40279fd49817f9605baed742de8eb69","title":"corbyn vows to end greed is good capitalism in uk","story":"In conference speech Labour leader to lay out plans to change direction of economyJeremy Corbyn will on Wednesday attack the “greed-is-good” capitalism that he claims has resulted in large swaths of the UK being left behind, promising a raft of new policies including a “green jobs revolution” that will create 400,000 new positions.The Labour leader will attempt to reset the theme of the Labour conference which has so far been dominated by deep isions over its Brexit stance and return to his core argument about the failure of the broken economic system.Corbyn will use his main conference speech to set out his plans to change the direction of the economy, following a week in which his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, laid out a series of redistributive policies.The Labour leader will say: “Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.””But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.“People in this country know – they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn’t working any more. That’s why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.”Corbyn will announce plans for a rollout of green technologies including 13,500 onshore and offshore wind turbines, solar panels on thousands of roofs and wide-scale home insulation.A green energy report published by the party on Wednesday will hint at an expansion of other renewable technologies to come, including tidal power, hydrogen and controversially, nuclear, which would help meet tough climate change targets.He is expected to say: “There is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example. Our energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.The move is designed to be a big offer from the party to help regenerate so-called left behind towns. Many of them are traditionally Labour but leave-backing seats where the party went backwards in support at the last general election.Following a fraught summer dominated by rows over antisemitism, a Labour spokesman played down expectations that Corbyn would apologise directly to the Jewish community in his speech, suggesting that he had already done so.Corbyn will instead concentrate on his plans to reform capitalism, which have so far been fronted by McDonnell, and include policies to tackle high pay and excessive corporate bonuses.However, Labour aides did not expand on how Corbyn would have dealt with the financial crisis differently, insisting that he believed the last Labour government had done all that it could, and that it was the system that had been at fault.The promised investment in green technologies would be paid for from Labour’s £250bn national transformation fund, announced at the last general election, with the home insulation programme alone costing £12.8bn through a variety of subsidies.The plans would involve a dramatic sevenfold increase in offshore windfarms by 2030, with 7,500 turbines powering 12m homes and creating 120,000 jobs, including in the north-east and Humber.There would be 6,000 more turbines onshore, powering 5m homes and creating 60,000 jobs, an ambitious target given the scale of opposition to many existing windfarms.Labour would also invest in solar panels, reversing Tory cuts to power 2.5m homes and create 70,000 jobs. It would insulate homes to high energy efficient standards, creating a 160,000 army of energy assessors, engineers, technicians.The announcement is reminiscent of a pledge from Gordon Brown in 2009 for a “green revolution” which the then prime minister said would create 400,000 jobs over eight years.Among the other policy announcements in the speech are details of a plan to extend the government’s 30 hours of free childcare scheme to the parents of all two-, three- and four-year-olds, which would benefit more than a million children.Families on the lowest incomes would be eligible for additional subsidised hours on top of the 30 hours, which would be free for them and cost no more than £4 per hour for those on the highest incomes, with a sliding scale in between.Corbyn will also pledge to increase average early years funding rates to help the many childcare providers that are struggling – some have even closed – as a result of the 30-hour policy, which they argue is not properly funded.The childcare system would be simplified for parents with the launch of a national childcare online access portal, which would replace the existing complicated mix of vouchers and credits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84a466ef10aa188be37a161e5034b1a81f85775/0_47_2616_1570/master/2616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f841c0dda34e80a3f0bb76f16f528b","title":"no deal brexit better than canada style deal theresa may","story":"Prime minister says basic trade deal touted by hardline Tories would risk breakup of UKA no-deal Brexit would be better for the UK than any Canada-style free trade agreement allowed by the EU, Theresa May has argued as she arrived at a United Nations summit determined to regain control of the narrative after some bruising recent days for her own Chequers proposal.At the start of a two-day trip to New York, the prime minister knocked down the possibility of a more basic free trade deal with the EU touted by more hardline Brexiters in her Conservative party, saying it could prompt the disintegration of the UK.May – who criticised Labour’s Brexit plans as “not in the national interest” – also robustly defended her aim for continued alignment with EU standards in areas such as livestock and agriculture, saying the UK would want to maintain these anyway, and that they should not be a barrier to outside trading plans.“If having those EU regulations stopped good trade deals, how come the EU has done trade deals with countries around the rest of the world?” May said, a comment likely to raise some eyebrows among some strongly pro-Brexit Tory MPs.On Monday a series of hardline Tories, including the former Brexit secretary David Davis, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, endorsed a Canada-style free trade alternative to Brexit, arguing it was the only way the UK could reap the full benefits of departure.Speaking to reporters on her flight to the UN’s general assembly, where she will meet Donald Trump and the Iranian and Turkish presidents among other assembled leaders, May said the Brexiters’ plan would necessitate a hard Irish border and thus invoke the EU’s so-called backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland within elements of the customs union and single market, effectively drawing a customs border in the Irish Sea.A no-deal departure would be preferable, she said: “First of all, I’ve always said no deal is better than a bad deal. I think a bad deal will be a deal, for example, that broke up the United Kingdom. We want to maintain the unity of the United Kingdom.“What we’ve put on the table is a good deal. It’s a deal that retains the unity of the United Kingdom, our constitutional integrity. It’s a deal which provides for no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, protects jobs and enables us to have a good trade relationship with Europe and good trade relationships with the rest of the world.”At an informal EU summit in Salzburg last week, May had hoped to receive supportive words for her Chequers plan before what is expected to be a bruising Conservative party conference starting on Sunday. Instead, the prime minister was told that Brussels still had significant and fundamental problems with the plan.Asked whether she continued to face the impasse outlined in her robust statement at Downing Street the day after the summit, May said subsequent words from Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, had showed signs of progress.“I think what he has clarified is that there is hope and expectation for a deal on the side of the European Union, and of course there are aspects of the Chequers proposal which they’re comfortable with,” she said.There was, however, more to be done, May said: “I believe it would work not just for us but for the EU. But if they have concerns they need to detail those concerns to us, and if they have counter-proposals let’s hear the counter-proposals, and then we can discuss those and take it forward.”Asked about Labour’s ideas for Brexit that emerged from its conference this week, May condemned the expectation that the party’s MPs will vote against her final deal.“From the Labour party’s point of view they will oppose any deal I bring back, regardless of how good it is for the UK, and they will accept any deal Europe gives, regardless of how bad it is for the UK,” she said. “That’s not in the national interest. What we’re doing is in the national interest.”May, who arrived in New York on Tuesday lunchtime local time, was scheduled to meet the presidents of Iran, Turkey and France – Hassan Rouhani, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Emmanuel Macron – and the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau.On Wednesday May will meet Trump, address the general assembly, and discuss Brexit and trade with business leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b266615d71fc0a1a6e6890e1209018f3a4112295/0_320_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ba28d03386361917d4949acc104df48","title":"theresa may rules out an autumn general election before brexit","story":"Election will not be in nation’s interest says prime minister at start of New York visitTheresa May has ruled out the idea of another general election before Brexit day, saying it “would not be in the national interest”.Speculation about the idea of an autumn election to break the Brexit deadlock within the government has increased since the prime minister’s Chequers plan got a cool reception from EU leaders in Salzburg.And at Labour’s party conference in Liverpool this week there have been repeated calls from John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and other senior party figures for a swift election to allow the public to say whether they are happy with May’s Brexit negotiations.But asked by reporters en route to New York for a UN summit whether she could guarantee that there would not be another election before Brexit next March, the prime minister responded: “What I am doing is working to deliver a good deal with Europe in the national interest. It would not be in the national interest to have an election.”Whatever May’s confidence, and despite the seemingly tight timetable, the guarantee is not entirely in the prime minister’s gift, as events could push her into having to call an election.If May’s Brexit plan were to be turned down by parliament that could be seen as an expression of no confidence significant enough to merit an election. Similarly if May were forced from office by a mass of cabinet resignations over Chequers, or through a formal motion by Tory MPs, a change of prime minister could also be seen as a trigger for a general election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac2d97c5b655ccf7481e7a4b615d9fbe832b4bcb/0_175_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e6be7e5433ae235e848c43a186859b","title":"tuesday at the labour party conference","story":"A row over Brexit and a passionate speech by Emily Thornberry were among the highlights of the dayTosh McDonald, Aslef president, on Margaret Thatcher: “I hated her. I wish I could be like Jeremy and rise above it but I can’t ... I did set my alarm clock an hour earlier than I needed just so I could hate her for an hour longer.”Brexit. Steve Turner, an assistant general secretary of Unite, stepped on to the podium in the morning to slap down shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer over the party’s second referendum policy. Starmer had wowed delegates when he declared to the hall, “Nobody is ruling out remain as an option” – prompting the party’s most powerful union to hit back.There was not so much applause for Turner, when he spoke an hour later, but there was no mistaking his intent. If Labour were to organise a second referendum “despite what Keir Starmer may have said”, it would be “a public vote, that’s a vote on terms of our departure”. That meant that the choice put before the electorate would be to endorse the deal negotiated by the government of the day – or no deal at all.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, made a passionate and wide-ranging speech which was well-received on the conference floor and interpreted by some as a leadership pitch.The MP pointedly compared antisemites within Labour to fascists, and said the party had to act now: “If we want to root out fascism and racism and hatred from our world, and from our country, then we must start, we must start, with rooting it out of our own party.”Continuing the focus on the fight against fascism in the UK, Thornberry also highlighted Labour’s long history fighting the far right, arguing that there was no need to resurrect the Anti-Nazi League because Labour effectively was the anti-Nazi League.On foreign affairs, Thornberry promised that, under Corbyn, the UK would “lead the world in promoting human rights, in reforming the arms trade, in pursuing an end to conflict, in supporting, not demonising, refugees, and in turning the promise of a nuclear-free world from an impossible dream to a concrete goal”.A plan to create a second deputy leader position for a woman was unexpectedly shelved when the constituency party that had submitted the rule change, Wirral West, suddenly dropped the motion, almost certainly at the suggestion of the party’s leadership. A former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown speculated as to why:Jeremy Corbyn’s speech at noon. Gone are the days when the leader’s speech was on Tuesday afternoon in the middle of a week-long conference, meaning that the rest of the week was something of an anti-climax. Now it is the final event: the early signs are that the Labour leader will seek to shift the agenda to the party’s offer to the country after a dismal summer in which the row about antisemitism dominated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dbc49daf2c3b536fddaa4b12fd49c468ffb688b/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d73a608ceba3c00ba5a60accf7ccf09b","title":"rfu perplexed agustin pichot reform rugby calendar","story":"The Rugby Football Union is “perplexed” at moves from World Rugby’s vice-chairman, Agustín Pichot, to drastically reform the international calendar by introducing a World League from 2020 onwards.Pichot’s proposal – in which the world’s top 12 teams would compete in an annual tournament switched between hemispheres every November – is set to be discussed as the World Rugby Council meets in Sydney this week.The RFU would oppose the idea on the basis that the autumn international series is a huge source of revenue – it is estimated each match at Twickenham generates up to £10m. But the union is also frustrated because international windows in July and November from 2020 onwards were the cornerstone of an agreement reached by World Rugby in San Francisco last January.Along with Premiership Rugby (PRL) and the Rugby Players’ Association (RPA), the RFU is close to announcing how the domestic season in England fits into the global calendar as agreed in San Francisco.An RFU spokesperson told the : “We are a bit perplexed at these apparent developments and ideas which we have not been party to. We have worked really hard with our stakeholders PRL and RPA to define the new domestic season and we are working to the principles agreed with World Rugby which we have been assured are still valid.”It is understood the RFU lodged a complaint with World Rugby over Pichot’s comments and received assurances from the global governing body’s chairman Bill Beaumont. Since then details of Pichot’s plans – as well as reported meetings with executives from the New Zealand, South Africa and French unions – have emerged.The RFU expects discussions on the global calendar in Sydney to centre on how commercial revenues from the international game can be increased based on the San Francisco agreement.

It was his first victory since 2013 – and his 80th PGA Tour title in total – and completed a stunning return from a fourth back operation. As he now turns his focus to the Ryder Cup, the world No 13 says he is relishing playing against – and with – those who have never experienced him in his prime.“The younger guys were on their way in when I was on my way out,” he said. “They had never really played against me when I was playing well. It’s been five years since I’ve won a tournament.Thomas, Spieth, DeChambeau and Koepka at least have Woods as a teammate this week. McIlroy and Rose are prominent members of the opposition.Further proof that the Woods swagger is back came in a strange Tuesday moment when a member of the media thanked the 14-times major winner for delivering another victory. Woods could not resist a dig in his reply. “There have been a lot of you who have supported me through a lot of the years, and many have doubted that I’d play again, and win again,” Woods said. “So I want to say thank you to all the people that have supported me.”The scale of Woods’s East Lake win, which has been felt across sport, has not yet resonated with the man himself. Woods joined the USA team who flew overnight to Paris on Sunday into Monday, and has instantly reacquainted himself with Ryder Cup matters.“I’ve been trying to answer the text messages I’ve gotten but I’m still well north of 150,” he said. “I haven’t really had a lot of time to soak it in. I will, post-Ryder Cup. I’ll take a look back and reflect on it. I saw a couple of videos on some French news channel but I haven’t sat down and watched it yet. I still have this event to do.“Post-Ryder Cup, it will be a different story. I will look back and soak it up and really reflect on what transpired that entire week.”His focus on the event is understandable. He has been involved in one USA victory in seven playing appearances and that was as long ago as Brookline 1999. The Americans have not won in Europe since 1993. “We haven’t done well,” Woods said. “The year that we won in 2008 I had reconstruction knee surgery after the US Open and I didn’t play. I was a vice-captain in 2016, but it’s different being a player.“My overall Ryder Cup record, not having won as a player since 1999, is something that hopefully we can change. We haven’t won as a US squad here in 25 years on foreign soil, so hopefully that will change this week, as well.“ There’s a lot of nerves. It’s excitement. It’s a different atmosphere and one that we absolutely love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65afed543ee5c28b24f0a2e636c45b82011cf14d/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98ac9b619ad3c42fe9873f95969d0ac4","title":"brett kavanaugh second accuser testimony","story":"Donald Trump has disparaged one of two women to accuse Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, saying she “has nothing” on his supreme court nominee and was “messed up” when the alleged incident took place, as he accused Democrats of running a “con game” to stop the nomination.Trump, seated next to the Colombian president at the United Nations in New York, cast doubt on allegations brought by Deborah Ramirez, who claimed that she was harassed by Kavanaugh when they were first-year students at Yale.“The second accuser has nothing,” Trump said. “The second accuser thinks maybe it could have been him, maybe not. She admits she was drunk. She admits time lapses.”“She was totally inebriated and all messed up and she doesn’t know,” he continued, adding sarcastically: “Gee, let’s not make him a supreme court judge.”In Washington, the Senate judiciary committee scheduled a vote on his nomination for Friday morning, just one day after the panel will hear public testimony from Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford about her claim that he sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegations. “I had never sexually assaulted anyone, not in high school, not ever,” he said in an interview with Fox News.Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee, called it “outrageous” to schedule a vote before hearing from Ford.“First Republicans demanded Dr Blasey Ford testify immediately. Now Republicans don’t even need to hear her before they move ahead with a vote,” she said. “It’s clear to me that Republicans don’t want this to be a fair process.”The committee chairman, Chuck Grassley, insisted that scheduling the vote was only a precautionary measure in the event that members were prepared to move forward on Friday.The move sets the stage for a vote in the full Senate sometime next week and comes as Republicans increasingly express confidence that Kavanaugh will be confirmed. In a speech on the Senate floor Tuesday, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, promised a swift vote after Thursday’s hearing, arguing that “vague, unsubstantiated and uncorroborated allegations of 30-plus-year-old misconduct” were “nowhere near grounds to nullify someone’s career or destroy their good name”.He also continued his attacks on Democrats, accusing them of failing to afford Kavanaugh any “presumption of innocence” in their effort to keep him off the court.Speaking after McConnell, the minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said the Kentucky Republican should “apologize immediately” to Ford for calling her allegations against the judge part of a “smear” job led by Democrats. He said it was “galling” for McConnell to blame Democrats for playing partisan games with the accusations when he has done “more than maybe anyone to politicize the supreme court nomination process”.“Don’t they want the truth?” Schumer asked of Republicans. On Tuesday afternoon, Schumer reiterated Democrats’ demand for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.Alaska senator Lisa Murkowski, seen as a crucial Republican swing vote, appeared to agree. Asked if the FBI should reopen its background investigation into the judge, she told reporters: “Well, it would sure clear up all the questions, wouldn’t it?”Senate Republicans hardened their defense of Kavanaugh even as they sought to assure Ford that she would receive “fair and respectful” treatment when she testifies on Thursday. McConnell announced on Tuesday that Republicans had hired an unnamed female attorney to handle questioning during the hearing, with Democrats saying the move was inconsistent with the GOP pledge to avoid a “circus”. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican member of the committee, said rejecting Kavanaugh’s nomination on the basis of Ford’s allegation alone would send a strong signal to future supreme court nominees.“If this is enough – 35 years in the past, no specifics about location and time, no corroboration – God help the next batch of nominees that come forward,” he told reporters. “It’s going to be hard to recruit good people if you go down based on allegations that are old and unverified.”But Kavanaugh’s fate rests with a handful of Republican senators: Murkowski, Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate.Collins and Murkowski, who are not on the Senate committee, told reporters this week that they would wait for the hearing to make up their mind. Flake, who is retiring, was among the first to call for delaying a committee vote to hear from Ford.Ford has alleged that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a party more than three decades ago, when he was 17 and she was 15, saying he put his hand over her mouth to stop her screaming as he attempted rape. Ford reluctantly came forward after pieces of her account began leaking to the press and she later agreed to appear before the Senate committee. There is no plan yet for Ramirez, the second accuser, to testify before the panel. In an interview with the New Yorker magazine, Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of thrusting his genitals in her face at a drunken dorm party during the 1983-84 academic calendar.Earlier on Tuesday, the White House indicated that it was open to the idea of hearing testimony from Ramirez at that hearing before the Senate judiciary committee.“Certainly we would be open to that, and that process could take place on Thursday,” Sanders said during an appearance on ABC’s Good Morning America. “The president has been clear, let them speak.”A third woman is expected to step forward with new allegations this week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd621dcb8a44c84b1397b01fba0c5ee5c271a02f/0_226_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a8b5d7f9bb47c4d20f3189b801f3773","title":"england has more than 200000 empty homes how to revive them","story":"New schemes are taking derelict homes and resurrecting them. Some even create apprenticeships for young people in the processAsk most people about England’s epidemic of empty homes and they are likely to think of lavish vacant mansions in London owned by absent foreign billionaires.In fact, the majority of empty properties are in post-industrial areas, where poverty rates are high and house prices languish well below their pre-crash levels. Such a place is Stockton-on-Tees, near Middlesbrough, where Martyn Jones lives.Two years ago Jones, 23, was homeless and relying on friends to let him sleep on their couches while he struggled to find work. Today, he is painting a wall in a gutted home on a quiet street, part of a group tasked with refurbishing some of the area’s many vacant, derelict homes.Last week, Theresa May pledged an extra £2bn for housing associations to fund large-scale developments. But with new house building not providing enough affordable homes for more than 1 million people on waiting lists in England, social enterprises and councils are trying to bring empty homes, which number well over 200,000 and are worth almost £50bn, back into occupancy.One of them is Community Campus 87, which buys such properties in Stockton-on-Tees, refurbishes them and offers them to previously homeless tenants at rents below the going rate for social housing. In the process, it provides jobs and skills training for people such as Jones.Having left school at 16, Jones struggled with substance use and anxiety, unable to hold down a job. When his mother kicked him out, he worried he was out of options. “I wouldn’t be here today if it wasn’t for Campus,” he says. “They gave me a home, helped me along the way and now I’ve started going to college.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAt the opposite end of the country, Plymouth city council is offering landlords loans and grants of up to £50,000 per property to bring 375 long-term vacant properties back into use in the next three years. Fifty-nine homes were brought back into occupancy within the first year, but Dan Thorning, a housing officer, acknowledges there have been challenges.“It can take significant time to build rapport and trust with some owners of empty homes, or to get contractors on board that are willing to work on a project where there are complex issues,” he says. “Sometimes when owners refuse to work with us, we have no choice but to use enforcement powers to bring their properties back into use.”Plymouth is following the lead of Kent county council, whose pioneering no use empty initiative won a prestigious regeneration award earlier in 2018. Its interest-free loans have helped to transform 5,400 empty homes since 2005.In Stoke-on-Trent, the council has allowed people to buy derelict homes for just £1, on the condition they stay for 10 years and commit to investing in the property. The relative success of such projects has helped fuel calls for community-led housing to play a greater role in alleviating the housing shortage, which has coincided with home ownership falling to a 30-year low.The Giroscope group in Yorkshire also refurbishes empty homes for subsidised housing, and has had success branching out into a microbrewery, bakery, condiment manufacturer and a vegetarian cafe and shop. Profits are reinvested into the business, but funding remains the key challenge.A government scheme, the empty homes programme, was set up in 2012 to provide about £100m to community groups for refurbishments. It was ended by the Conservative government in 2015. Swingeing funding cuts to local authorities have further undermined renewal schemes, while the money is drying up for charities too more than £3.8bn in government grants has been cut over the past decade.Banks can charge twice the rate of interest for loans to social enterprises as to commercial firms, if they agree to lend at all. This can hobble local startups and force them to lease rather than buy properties, meaning they ultimately return to the owner after refurbishment.Transferring empty properties to organisations which refurbish them and offer them to let at below local housing allowance rates means local authorities benefit from council tax receipts, the area gradually repopulates and the social enterprises can use the assets to raise money to buy more properties.The alternative is councils paying millions for emergency accommodation because they do not have enough housing stock to deliver their statutory duty to house homeless people, nor the funds to renovate the properties themselves, while whole neighbourhoods elsewhere are cut loose to rot.The homeless charity Centrepoint say that schemes like these provide some of the vulnerable people in society with a chance to develop the skills they need to get on in life.“These community led schemes offer a fantastic opportunity for them, and all those who unfortunately face homelessness, by not only providing affordable housing but also the hands-on experience and support to develop the key skills they will need in the world of work,” said Paul Noblet, its head of public affairs. “We hope that the example set by these schemes will inspire both government and employers to take similar action.”The housing charity Empty Homes says the absence of dedicated national funding means community-based approaches are more important than ever. These have a proven track record and they offer the best returns in financial, social and housing terms.“These organisations see beyond profit to save those in housing need,” says Chris Bailey, a campaign manager at Empty Homes. “They do so while delivering lower costs and better social outcomes reinvesting in more affordable housing and improving the local area.”This translates into people such as Martyn Jones finding a path to a better life rather than heading further out into the margins. “I wouldn’t know where my life would be heading without Campus,” he says. “This gives me hope for the future.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Commercial operations are due to begin next week.“The journey between the Haramain (two holy mosques) is now shorter and easier than at any time before,” the Saudi transport minister, Nabil al-Amoudi, told dignitaries gathered at the Jeddah station. “The project highlights the kingdom’s commitment to serving Islam and Muslims.”Pilgrimage is the backbone of a plan to expand tourism under economic reforms announced two years ago by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to ersify the economy. The hajj, a journey every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must perform once in a lifetime, can be a profound experience.It is also big business for Saudi Arabia. The hajj and the year-round lesser pilgrimage, umrah, generate billions of dollars in revenues from worshippers’ lodging, transport, gifts, food and fees.The new rail link was built by a Spanish-led consortium and financed by the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. It halves travel time between Mecca, the spiritual heart of Islam, and Medina, its second most sacred site.Project manager Mohammed Fallatah said the train would offer fast and reliable transportation to pilgrims as well as Saudis and foreign residents.“The traveller will be comfortable. He can read books or magazines or enjoy watching the screens in business class, have a coffee or a light meal,” he said before Tuesday’s ceremony.The authorities hope the train will also stimulate growth of King Abdullah Economic City, a massive business zone that was initiated under the previous ruler but remains relatively empty.It will eventually link up with a new terminal at Jeddah airport, which has already started serving select domestic routes and will take over all flights by early next year.Fatallah said further expansion could include connecting to a planned east-west train between the capital, Riyadh, and Jeddah.Pilgrims comprise the bulk of Saudi Arabia’s 20 million annual foreign visitors, apart from workers and business travellers. More than 2 million came for this year’s hajj and 6.5 million performed umrah in 2017.Officials aim to increase the number of umrah and hajj pilgrims to 15 million and five million respectively by 2020, and hope to double the umrah number again to 30 million by 2030.In addition to public transit, Saudi Arabia is investing tens of billions of dollars in mega-hotels and a Grand Mosque restoration in Mecca.The Faisaliah project, running from the edge of Mecca towards the Red Sea, aims to attract visitors to coastal getaways and Islamic research centres."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66e3e2e02c64b8b15e53b7d6ed22df12271bfe4d/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79eb41d80d0512b8b9fd0bcb04468461","title":"us sanctions venezuela first lady vice president","story":"Comments come after White House slaps financial sanctions on Nicolás Maduro’s inner circle over corruption allegationsDonald Trump has suggested that Venezuela’s leader Nicolás Maduro could be easily toppled by a military coup as the US stepped up financial pressure with fresh sanctions on Maduro’s inner circle.Trump declined to respond to questions about whether a US-led military intervention in the crisis-stricken country was possible, but on the sidelines of the UN general assembly he said: “It’s a regime that, frankly, could be toppled very quickly by the military if the military decides to do that.“It’s a truly bad place in the world today.”His comments came after the US slapped financial sanctions on Maduro’s wife, vice-president and other senior Venezuelan figures.As part of the actions, the US barred Americans from doing business with and will seize any financial assets in the US belonging to the first lady, Cilia Flores, Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, the communications minister, Jorge Rodríguez, and defence minister, Vladimir Padrino.“We are continuing to designate loyalists who enable Maduro to solidify his hold on the military and the government while the Venezuelan people suffer,” the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said in a statement. “Treasury will continue to impose a financial toll on those responsible for Venezuela’s tragic decline, and the networks and frontmen they use to mask their illicit wealth.”During his speech at the United Nations general assembly, the US president singled out Venezuela for criticism, saying: “Not long ago, Venezuela was one of the richest countries on Earth. Today, socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty …“We ask the nations gathered here to join us in calling for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela.” Over the past two years the Trump administration has sanctioned dozens of iniduals, including Maduro himself, on allegations of corruption, drug trafficking and human rights abuses.But until now it had spared key leaders such as Delcy Rodríguez, as well as the US-trained Padrino, believing they occupy seats of power and could play a key role in an eventual transition.David Smilde, a Tulane University professor who has spent more than two decades living and working in Venezuela, said Tuesday’s actions would seem to suggest the US has given up trying to sow ision within the government in the hopes it could force a democratic transition from within.“This clearly breaks from that strategy,” said Smilde. “If everyone is sanctioned then it could end up uniting the government.”Trump, arriving at the United Nations general assembly before his speech Tuesday, said Venezuela is “a very sad case and we want to see it fixed. What’s happening there is a human tragedy.”But beyond rallying Maduro’s opponents, it is unclear what impact the sanctions will have.For more than a year, top US officials have struggled to build support for more sweeping oil sanctions, facing resistance from energy companies still active in the country and fearing it could tip the Opec nation over the edge at a time of hyperinflation and widespread food and medicine shortages.As part of the actions announced on Tuesday, the US Department of the Treasury also seized a $20m private jet belonging to an alleged frontman for powerful socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello."},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"Employees are looking to companies for provision of workplace wellness initiativesInternational companies raise employee expectations of what a modern office should look likeAnxiety, stress and depression are the second highest causes of work-related illness in IrelandTeam-working, creativity and problem-solving are in demand among hiring managersAs soon as you walk into the building, you are on interviewMy career path: Stephen McGrath works for the property department at LidlMy career path: Kyle Moore works with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3641378.1537905908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"allowance increase could benefit 18 000 nurses says government","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Psychiatric Nurses’ Association said it had identified up to 700 nursing vacancies in mental health services across the country. Photograph: Frank MillerThe Government believes that more than 18,000 nurses could benefit from the proposals to increase allowances for those working in certain parts of the health service which are facing staffing difficulties.The Government also said about 10,000 nurses could benefit from the proposed new measures to address the lower pay rates for staff across the public service recruited since 2011.Some nurses could benefit from both Government initiatives however, others may not receive anything extra at all.The Minister for Public Expenditure, Paschal Donohoe, insisted on Monday that the proposals to address the two-tier pay system – which could be worth more than €3,000 on average to public service staff over time – would only be available to those groups that remained inside the existing public service pay agreement, which runs until 2020.He maintained that the Government would not be offering any more money to staff than set out under the new proposals.The Psychiatric Nurses’ Association (PNA) argued on Tuesday that the finding of the Pay Commission, that there was no issue in general regarding nurse retention, was “completely inaccurate and misleading”.The union said it had identified up to 700 nursing vacancies in mental health services across the country.The PNA said its latest audit of psychiatric nursing vacancies showed the number of unfilled nursing posts in the mental health services was growing. It said there were are now nearly 200 more vacancies throughout the country than when the PNA conducted a similar exercise last year.The PNA maintained there were 88 vacancies at St Ita’s Hospital in Portrane, in north Co Dublin, 56 in Dublin north city, 62 in Galway and 46 in LouthMeath.PNA general secretary Peter Hughes said the Pay Commission had completely ignored the scale of the mounting recruitment and retention crisis facing the mental health services.“Over a year ago the PNA pointed out that HSE figures from as recently as 2016 revealed that, due to the age profile of psychiatric nurses, there is potential for up to 1,752 psychiatric nurses to retire immediately or within the next five years – equating to 34.2 per cent of the mental health nursing workforce,” said Mr Hughes. “PNA’s new figures confirm that the number of nursing vacancies is in fact growing annually.”He said the conclusion of the Pay Commission that there is no issue with nurse recruitment is completely at odds with the evidence and experience of psychiatric nurses across the mental health services."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Unsafe staffing levels and overcrowding led to demonstration at Connolly Hospital, protester explainsMany school staff not trained to deal with challenging behaviour, say campaignersGarda claims candidates with lower interview scores were selected over himPay Commission finding that nurse retention is not an issue is \u0026lsquoinaccurate\u0026rsquo, says nurses\u0026rsquo groupA very long lead-in time to getting \u0026lsquoa hole in the ground\u0026rsquo, says council officialFrom science to construction, skills shortages continue to be a challenge for employers across industryPersonal ethics can be a guiding factor for graduates considering job offersThere have been no reports of injuries as of yet, but fire services remain at the sceneSinn F\u0026eacutein motion of no confidence in Eoghan Murphy defeated 59 votes to 49Diarmuid Martin claims removing church for education entirely would damage pluralismMinister had seemed to accept amendments to controversial Bill aimed at reducing consumptionWexford TD claims Government \u0026lsquowedded\u0026rsquo to policy that housing market will fix itselfChildren being \u0026lsquoleft at side of the road\u0026rsquo due to poor handling of transport scheme \u0026ndash TDs saySmartphone battery, imaging, babies\u0026rsquo vaccine and skin-ageing among latest stridesArlene Foster says she did not know the scale of the issues with the green energy schemeRegina Doherty says misogyny towards single mothers is \u0026lsquonot diminishing fast enough\u0026rsquoRebecca Carter says decision not to recheck her results now will cost her a place in UCDAlcohol, under-reporting and lack of understanding make it difficult to measure extent of problemNurses and midwives angry over pay and conditions as they prepare for special conferenceMichael Ring notes \u0026euro615m online spend but TD says many in rural areas have no broadband"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3641406.1537909910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo quells annual tizzy over christmas bonus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe money for the Christmas bonus will be found – but only after much effort on the Government’s part, it has to be said. And it was. Photograph: iStockThe radio ads for the pantos have started.Gaudy bauble shops are popping up in department stores around the country.And on Tuesday, in September, the annual tizzy over the Christmas social welfare bonus made its seasonal debut in Leinster House.2018 has definitely turned the final corner.The panic was sparked when rumours surfaced in the media, as they always do when the budget is on the horizon. It seems the Minister – looking over at her accounts and taking everything into consideration – took a sharp inhalation of breath and wondered if she could afford to pay it.Worried potential recipients immediately contacted their public representatives to find out where they stand now and to voice their concerns about losing this welcome financial boost.Questions were asked on the floor of the Dáil.This allowed the Taoiseach to gallop in on his white charger and say all is well.“I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue and giving me an opportunity to allay people’s concerns. The Christmas bonus is really important, particularly for people who are on low and fixed incomes. It gives pensioners an opportunity to buy presents for their grandchildren. . .” soothed Leo, spooling in the string on his Government’s little pre-budget kite.“I can assure the Deputies that the Christmas bonus will be paid this year.”Regina Doherty, the Minister, was equally clear earlier in the day when assuring everyone that she had no intention of discontinuing the practice. Of course, the money will be found – but only after much effort on the Government’s part, it has to be said. And it was.Kite-flying isn’t what it used to be. This one flew for barely a day.Michael Lowry, meanwhile, is very worried about “the rapid decline of rural Ireland” and he used his Leaders’ Questions slot on behalf of the Rural Independents Group to read out a short speech on the subject.Improvements in the economy were not reaching beyond the urban populations, he declared, warning of “an unsettling mood of powerlessness among rural dwellers” which was affecting their wellbeing and desire to contribute to a society that offers little in return.“A balance must be restored or rural Ireland will die quickly and quietly.”Quietly? The TD for Tipperary should spend more time in the Dáil chamber.Lowry had a list: farming under pressure rural roads neglected lack of jobs depopulation young people migrating to towns post offices closing.“We have a wonderful nation of talented and creative people, and regardless of their addresses they are entitled to feel valued and empowered . . . Our policies need to be national and they need to be for the benefit of everyone,” he told the Taoiseach.Leo Varadkar was delighted with Michael’s contribution because it was one of those questions which is really a statement allowing him to murmur sweet nothings across the floor about how he loves the tractor dudes and stuff.“I thank Deputy Lowry for raising this important issue and I also want to assure him that this Government is committed to rural Ireland and to making sure that it is vibrant and prosperous and that it is a place where people want to live, want to stay, want to move their families into and can establish a business and run it successfully. Our plan for the nation, Project Ireland 2040, has rural Ireland at its heart . . .”And so on.One aspect of life outside the main urban areas is the hit and miss or non-existent nature of broadband. “Poor access to a proper broadband service and information technology is a huge disadvantage,” observed Lowry, who is not without experience in the area of mobile telecommunications. “It is impossible for country towns to attract industry as they have little prospect of competing against the city locations that already have it in place.”Maybe Michael knows a man who could help improve the situation?Although when the business consortium which looks set to scoop the most lucrative communications contract in the history of the State gets to work, Lowry’s worries should be at an end.The Taoiseach told him that only half the country had broadband when the Government took office and now about three-quarters have coverage “and we’re going to get the whole way so that we become one of the first countries in the world where every premises, no matter how remote, has access to broadband”.Fianna Fáil’s Dara Calleary,standing in for Micheál Martin, wanted to hear more about Leo’s ambitions for broadband.As over half a million homes, businesses and farms wait for the rollout of the new national broadband plan, “the process is more like ‘Lannigan’s Ball’ than anything else with so many people stepping in and stepping out of it”.Dara hoped the procurement rules were still being complied with in spite of all of the changes to the tendering parties. He was also anxious to hear the Taoiseach confirm when the assessment process for the current bidder will be finalised. Is the rollout still on schedule?”His concern was understandable as the tender process has been a messy, stop-start affair, with high-profile international contenders deciding to walk away, leaving just one bidder in the race for the big prize. The Denis O’Brien company Actavo, formerly Siteserv, which includes former Independent News and Media chairman Leslie Buckley as a board member, was named as a “key partner” of the final consortium led by US investor Granahan McCourt.Dara Calleary finds it all fascinating. Who wouldn’t?Leo said he assumed matters were proceeding in accordance with the normal procurement process but he would ask the Minister for Communications, Denis Naughten, to fill him in on the details.Meanwhile, the national picture is looking good. “I am confident it is on track and we will be able to sign a contract and we will have shovels in the ground and work under way in 2019.”It’ll be “as big a project in many ways as rural electrification”.Just think of the photo ops.“Will you have your high-vis jacket ready?” inquired Calleary.“I look forward to having the contracts signed,” smiled the Taoiseach.“Will that be on camera?”“I look forward to turning the sod, absolutely.”You can bet your house on that – if you have one.Michael Lowry will be pleased too, for his constituents."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3640923.1537882539!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"presidential round up full list of who local authorities backed","story":"It appears likely that voters will have six candidates to choose from on October 26th.

All local authorities have heard\u0026nbspfrom\u0026nbspwould-be presidential candidates and made decisions on nominationsSix candidates will contest the presidential election on October 26th. Incumbent President Michael D Higgins can and has nominated himself to run for re-election. Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada received the support of 20 Oireachtas members from her party.The other four contenders Independent Senator Joan Freeman, and three Dragons’ Den panellists Seán Gallagher, Peter Casey, and Gavin Duffy, all received the backing of four local authorities. Here is a round-up of the decisions taken by each local authority:Businessman Mr Duffy won the endorsement by 14 votes to two, with members of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour supporting him. The only other candidate to be proposed and seconded in Waterford was journalist and campaigner Gemma O’Doherty, who was backed by Independent councillors Seán Reinhardt and Joe Kelly.Dublin City Council voted not to endorse any candidate for the 2018 presidential election. Six presidential hopefuls were present in the council chamber on Thursday, September 13th, to plead their case for a nomination for the upcoming election. A theatrical presentation from Norma Burke, also know as Bunty Twuntingdon-McFuff, led to outrage and disgust from councillors in attendance.Kilkenny County Council voted not to nominate any candidates for the 2018 presidential election. A motion to nominate Gemma O’Doherty was defeated on Monday, 5-7, with 11 abstentions.Seán Gallagher’s name went back on the presidential ballot paper after Wexford County Council approved his nomination early on Monday afternoon. Mr Gallagher was one of two nominees, the other being Ms Freeman. Mr Gallagher secured 16 votes from Fianna Fáil and Independent councillors in the 34-person council and Ms Freeman received 10.Galway County Council has nominated Senator Joan Freeman to stand as a candidate in the presidential election. Ms Freeman was one of three candidates nominated at a special meeting of Galway County Council. Also nominated were Mr Casey and Mr Gallagher, although Mr Gallagher did not attend to make a presentation. Ms Freeman won by 12 votes to seven for Mr Casey and six for Mr Gallagher.Two nominations – that of Ms Freeman and Mr Gallagher – had been made to Galway City Council after a presentation by nine candidates to councillors last week. Mr Gallagher indicated he would be happy to withdraw as he had already secured the support of four local authorities. Seven councillors supported Ms Freeman, there was one vote against, and eight abstentions, while two councillors were absent.Former RTÉ Dragons’ Den panellist Peter Casey and journalist Gemma O’Doherty attended a special meeting of Monaghan County Council to seek support for their selection. The council decided to adjourn the proceedings to a further special meeting to decide on the question of support for potential contenders. However, no motions were put forward by any councillors to propose any of the candidates seeking nominations, so the council did not vote on the matter.Mr Gallagher received his third endorsement of the day in his bid to become a presidential candidate after Leitrim county councillors backed him on Monday. Fianna Fáil councillor Mary Bohan told colleagues that Mr Gallagher had been “shafted” by RTÉ in the last presidential election and deserved a second chance.Seven presidential hopefuls were due to make contributions to a special session of Mayo County Council but only one turned up, Sarah Louise Mulligan. All the other scheduled speakers sent their apologies stating that they could not attend due to similar meetings elsewhere. Strongly backed by Fianna Fáil members, Mr Gallagher was nominated to contest the presidency on a 12-10 vote.Mr Gallagher secured 10 of the 16 votes available. Three councillors voted for Senator Joan Freeman, and two voted for Gemma O’Doherty. One councillor abstained and two were absent.Joan Freeman received her third nomination to contest the presidential election on Monday afternoon when Fingal County Council endorsed the independent senator.

However, a full meeting of the council on Monday night decided not to proceed with the nomination process.South Dublin County Council voted against nominating any candidate. Sarah Louise Mulligan was ejected from a meeting of the local authority as she made her pitch to councillors for a nomination, after she shouted at Social Democrat councillor Dermot Looney, demanding an apology for a remark he made. Gemma O’Doherty also addressed the meeting seeking a nomination.Sean Gallagher visited the council headquarters in Tullamore along with candidates William Delaney, Peter Casey and Gemma O’Doherty. Mr Gallagher thanked the eight Fianna Fáil members who had offered him their support but asked them instead to leave the field open for other candidates, as he had already secured the required nominations. The local authority did not nominate any candidate.Wicklow County Council voted to give Gavin Duffy his third nomination.Kerry County Council gave businessman Peter Casey his first nomination. He was proposed by Fianna Fáil.The majority of councillors on Louth County Council voted not to nominate someone for the election.

However the meeting did not proceed as no prospective candidates were proposed.Elected members of Clare County Council voted for Peter Casey’s name to appear on the ballot paper for the election of President. At a September meeting of the local authority held in Áras Contae an Chláir, seven councillors voted to put forward the businessman to contest. Eighteen elected representatives of the local authority abstained from voting, these included all eight Fine Gael councillors, seven Fianna Fáil members, two Independents and Sinn Féin’s sole councillor Mike McKee.

Photograph: Pau BarrenaAFPGetty ImagesManuel Valls was born 56 years ago in Barcelona, but his Swiss mother and Catalan father, a well-known painter, moved to Paris to escape Franco’s rule. He was naturalised a French citizen at the age of 20 and rose through the ranks of the socialist party to become François Hollande’s interior minister (2012-2014), then prime minister (2014-2016).Now, in what may prove to be an unprecedented act of self-reinvention and political resurrection, Valls is set to announce his candidacy to become mayor of Barcelona at a “civic event” at the Centre of Contemporary Culture in Barcelona on Tuesday evening.No head of a European government has pursued a political career in another EU country. The closest parallels are the 19th-century statesman Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was born in Nice and served in both the Italian and French parliaments, and Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who was elected four times an MEP, twice as a German and twice as a French man.Valls says his interest in the Barcelona town hall is “an illustration of European citizenship”. Whether or not he wins, it may be a one-way trip. His prolonged absence has angered fellow deputies in the French National Assembly. And constituents in the Paris suburb of Evry, who Valls represented since 2002, feel abandoned. \u0026nbspWhile Valls spent more and more time in Barcelona this year, “nobody was in charge here”, a retired woman in Evry told Le Parisien newspaper. “The politicians all take us for fools. They ask us to vote for them, and then a year later they go away ... ”When Valls visited then taoiseach Enda Kenny in Dublin in April 2015, many French people fervently hoped for a presidential contest between Valls and the conservative politician Alain Juppé. It never happened. Rarely has such a promising political career fizzled out so inauspiciously.As interior minister, Valls had been the scourge of itinerant Roma. In the midst of jihadist attacks, his rhetoric was interpreted as Islamophobic. Things started going wrong for Valls when he took his sons on a government jet to a football match in Berlin. He was perceived as ill-tempered and over-ambitious.In a humiliating blow, Valls was defeated in the socialist presidential primary in January 2017. He nearly lost the seat he had held for 15 years in subsequent legislative elections, scraping through by only 139 votes over his far-left challenger from the France Unbowed party.Valls’s Catalan critics say he has come to Barcelona only because he was shoved aside by President Emmanuel Macron. Sources close to both politicians confirm the deep antipathy between them.When Macron was economy minister under Valls, he blamed Valls for gutting his reforms of bus transport and Sunday trading, then depriving Macron of the satisfaction of a parliamentary vote by passing his law by decree.It was a nightmare for Valls to see the young upstart with virtually no political experience snatch France’s highest political office from under his nose. To add insult to injury, Macron refused to allow Valls to stand for the National Assembly on the En Marche! ticket.Both Macron and Valls are pro-European social democrats who have been accused of veering to the right. Like Macron, Valls says the left-right ide in politics is outdated. Valls’s campaign in Barcelona looks set to mimic Macron’s winning formula.The centre-right Spanish party Ciudadanos (Citizens) supports Valls, but he may prefer to stand as an independent, in the hope of winning votes across as broad a spectrum as possible.A year after the referendum on Catalan independence, most of the leaders of the separatist movement are in prison or in exile, like the former president of the region, Carles Puigdemont, who lives in Belgium. Pro-Spanish Catalans believe they have found an articulate spokesman in Valls.Valls’s private life has followed the twists and turns of his political career. He had four children with his first wife, a school teacher. He and his second wife, a concert violinist, announced they were orcing last April. Valls had a brief liaison with the spokeswoman for the En Marche! group in the National Assembly.Then he was introduced to Susana Gallardo (53), the fabulously wealthy heiress to the Almirall pharmaceutical fortune and ex-wife of the owner of the Pronovias chain of wedding dress stores.Gallardo owns a mansion in Menorca and an apartment in Barcelona, where Valls now lives. Like Valls, she is a passionate advocate of Spanish unity. Valls’s detractors back in Paris say Gallardo’s influence and contacts book may be the most attractive things about her."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639723.1537798381!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"explainer has michael atiyah conquered the everest of mathematics","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn undated portrait of German mathematician Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866). Riemann established the foundations of modern differential geometry and, in 1859, formulated the hypothesis that bears his name.  Photograph: BettmannGetty ImagesA major mathematical result has been announced by British-Lebanese mathematician Sir Michael Atiyah. In a talk at the 6th Heidelberg Laureate Forum in Germany on Monday Atiyah outlined what he described as “a simple proof using a radically new approach” of the Riemann hypothesis – the most celebrated problem in modern mathematics.The Riemann hypothesis (RH) was highlighted by the great German mathematician David Hilbert at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris in 1900. Hilbert remarked: “If I were to awaken after sleeping for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?” The proof (or refutation) may come tomorrow, or we may have to wait for a century or more. The Riemann hypothesis is the Everest of mathematics.When asked which mathematicians he most admired, Atiyah named Bernhard Riemann and Irishman William Rowan Hamilton. Riemann established the foundations of modern differential geometry and, in 1859, formulated the hypothesis that bears his name. His work had a profound influence on the mathematics of the 20th century. He was very far in advance of his times, a deep and innovative mathematician. Riemannian geometry was the framework for Einstein’s theory of general relativity. Hamilton formulated what we call Hamiltonian mechanics, and invented quaternions. All the numbers we are familiar with, the “real numbers”, can be arranged as points on a line. But we can also consider points in a plane these give a richer set of numbers, the complex numbers. Each point in the plane has co-ordinates (a, b) and it was Hamilton who first gave the rules for multiplying pairs of numbers. This led him on to the more complicated quaternions numbers in four-dimensional space. It is obvious that x - 4 is zero when x  4. We say that the function f (x)  x - 4 has a zero at x  4. You may recall solving quadratic equations at school: these have two zeros. The Riemann zeta function is much trickier, and has an infinity of zeros. This function, defined by Riemann, takes a value for each point in the complex plane. Some of these values are zero: the negative even numbers, -2, -4, and so on all yield zero. Riemann believed the remaining zeros are on a vertical line, the critical line, in the complex plane. This is the Riemann hypothesis which, despite strenuous efforts, has never been proven. The RH can be formulated in erse and seemingly unrelated ways, some of which look deceptively simple: many statements equivalent to RH involve only real numbers. The hypothesis is inextricably intertwined with the distribution of prime numbers (primes cannot be expressed as products of smaller numbers), and the proof would have major consequences in number theory. Michael Berry of Bristol University encapsulates the hypothesis in the phrase “the primes have music in them”.Born in London in 1929, Atiyah was awarded a doctorate at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1955 for a thesis entitled Some Applications of Topological Methods in Algebraic Geometry. One of the leading mathematicians of the 20th century and still at the coal-face, Atiyah has spent most of his academic life in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the Abel Prize in 2004. Both of these awards are considered comparable to a Nobel Prize. His main interests have been in algebraic geometry, index theory and gauge theory. His best known result, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, proved in 1963, makes connections between geometry and quantum field theory. He has collaborated with many leading mathematicians and his work has revealed important interactions between geometry and physics. The proof presented by Atiyah depends on a new function called the Todd function, and is underpinned by ideas introduced by John von Neumann, a giant among 20th century mathematics. In his analytical theory, von Neumann introduced “the infinite iteration of exponentials”. The Todd function is related to the fine structure constant of fundamental physics, and Atiyah said that he “stumbled upon the proof” of RH while studying the fine structure constant. The proof is by contradiction: Atiyah assumes a zero off the critical line and shows that this leads to an impossible result. Therefore, the hypothesis must be true and the theorem is proved! Proof of RH has been outstanding for 160 years. Many reputable mathematicians have attempted and failed to prove it. Atiyah’s result, if right, would be a dramatic breakthrough. There is very little chance that he is correct: major proofs normally require large advances in understanding, while Atiyah has claimed a “simple proof”. His outline may lead to a complete proof or, more likely, may amount to nothing. In recent years, Atiyah has claimed to have proved other remarkable results but has failed to convince his peers. It seems incredible that Atiyah is right, but we will have to await the judgment of experts before we learn if he will collect the $1 million Millennium Prize.Prof Peter Lynch writes the That’s Maths column on The  science page and is emeritus professor at UCD School of Mathematics \u0026amp Statistics"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639707.1537798749!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"world of maths aflutter over new proof of 160 year old hypothesis","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish-Lebanese mathematician Michael Atiyah giving a lecture on the Riemann hypothesis on Monday at the Heidelberg Laureates Forum in Germany. Screengrab: YouTubeThe 90-year-old mathematician Michael Atiyah has presented what he referred to as a “simple proof” of the Riemann hypothesis, a problem which has eluded mathematicians for almost 160 years.The world of maths and the Twitter-sphere have been a frenzy ever since the British-Lebanese mathematician indicated he was to give a lecture on Monday at the Heidelberg Laureates Forum in Germany on what is widely regarded as the most important outstanding problem in maths.Although it is almost incomprehensible for people without intensive maths training, the hypothesis describes the distribution of prime numbers among positive integers.Prime numbers, very simple by definition, are the building blocks of modern mathematics, especially number theory. Achievements in prime number theory have been widely applied to computer sciences and telecommunications.However prime numbers are also mysterious and inexplicable – the pattern in which prime numbers emerge in the line of positive integers has remained elusive to generations of mathematicians.Riemann proposed a theory that can, in a way, shed light on that mystery but he could not prove it, nor could all the brilliant minds that came after.If a solution to the Riemann hypothesis is confirmed, it would be big news as mathematicians would be armed with a map to the location of all such prime numbers a breakthrough with far-reaching repercussions in the field.Atiyah, who specialises in geometry, is one of the UK’s most eminent mathematical figures, having received the two awards often referred to as the Nobel prizes of mathematics the Fields Medal and the Abel Prize.As one of the six unsolved “Clay Millennium Problems”, any solution would be eligible for a $1 million prize. This has tempted many mathematicians over the years, none of which has yet been awarded the prize.Atiyah is well aware of this history of failure. “Nobody believes any proof of the Riemann hypothesis, let alone a proof by someone who’s 90,” he said, but he hoped his presentation would convince his critics.In it, he paid tribute to the work of two great 20th century mathematicians, John von Neumann and Friedrich Hirzebruch, whose developments he claims laid the foundations for his own proposed proof. “It fell into my lap, I had to pick it up,” he said in advance of giving his talk.He has produced a number of papers in recent years making remarkable claims which have so far failed to convince his peers.“People say ‘we know mathematicians do all their best work before they’re 40’,” Atiyah said recently. “I’m trying to show them that they’re wrong. That I can do something when I’m 90.”Irish mathematician Prof Peter Lynch of UCD, who tuned into the talk, said in his view there was very little chance that Atiyah was correct: “Major proofs normally require large advances in understanding, while Atiyah has claimed a ‘simple proof’. His outline may lead to a complete proof or, more likely, may amount to nothing.”To win a millennium prize the solution has to be considered valid for a period of two years – though other mathematicians are likely to give their verdict in coming weeks.The Clay Millennium Prizes, announced in 2000, were conceived to record seven of the most difficult problems with which mathematicians were grappling at the turn of the second millennium.They were also designed “to elevate in the consciousness of the general public the fact that in mathematics, the frontier is still open and abounds in important unsolved problems to emphasise the importance of working towards a solution of the deepest, most difficult problems and to recognise achievement in mathematics of historical magnitude”."},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

It’s stuck next to a buoy, only coming up to breathe. It was a lot more active earlier. It\u0027s either stuck or there\u0027s something wrong with it.“Last weekend there was a great big wind from the north which probably pushed it down here. They only ever come to these narrow estuaries when there\u0027s something very wrong. The Thames is far too warm for it and I doubt it can feed.”The whale was first seen by ecologist Dave Andrews who tweeted footage on Tuesday morning, adding: “Can’t believe I am writing this, no joke. Beluga in the Thames.”The message sparked a frenzy on the Kent riverbank, with many locals abandoning their plans and taking to boats to watch the rare spectacle, prompting The British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) to urge people not to go on the water.The whale was spotted near Gravesend in KentKeen birdwatcher Gary Taylor, 50, from Kent, took the day off from his job as a property developer to see the whale.“This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I\u0027ve been out here just watching it for two hours. This is completely unprecedented. You\u0027d usually have to go to the Arctic to see this.”Naturalist Rupert Kaye, 58, also travelled from Putney in London to see the whale.“I heard about it at lunchtime and have never seen anything like this. I saw the bottlenose whale in the Thames a few years ago but this is on another level. You\u0027d have to travel to the far far north to see this usually.“I\u0027ve seen some great views of it. they\u0027re highly intelligent and have great navigational skills but who knows if it\u0027ll find its way home.”Last night animal and marine charities were working together to help the whale return to the sea and had a medical team on standby in case it became beached.“He or she is obviously very lost and quite possibly in trouble.”Crowds gather on the banks of the Thames to watch the whaleThe last beluga sightings were off the Northumberland and Northern Irish coasts in 2015, and the mammals are usually only spotted in the North Sea off Scotland.Lucy Babey, Head of Science \u0026amp Conservation at ORCA, a charity dedicated to the conservation of whales, dolphins and porpoises around the UK Coastline, said: “It\u0027s an incredibly unusual sighting.Considering how far the animal is from it\u0027s range, it may be distressed and so it is vital that onlookers both on land and at sea keep their distance.”Beluga’s are a distinctive species, with flexible necks, no dorsal fin and unlike most cetaceans they can also swim backwards. They are highly social species, living in pods of between two and 25, and communicating with high-frequency sounds. They have even been known to mimic human language.Once considered endangered, the beluga was reassessed last year and it is now listed ‘of least concern’ by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).Richard Sabin, Principal Curator of Mammals at the Natural History Museum, said the video footage of the whale suggested strongly it was a beluga.“The white body colour, absence of a prominent dorsal fin, bulbous forehead and general swimming motion all suggest this very strongly.“The beluga is an Arcticsub-Arctic species, so is a long way outside its usual range of distribution.”Please review our commenting policyUS-China relations crumble as disputes extend beyond trade warRepublican leader \u0026#39confident\u0026#39 Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed despite concerns of some senators Fury as council approves plans for driverless car test track on site of Battle of BosworthPolice in the dock for giving people the chance to spend Halloween in Fred West\u0026#39s cellComment: Are Theresa May\u0026#39s calls for a low-tax economy genuine, or is she trying to call the EU\u0026#39s bluff?Queen of the World, review: a fascinating portrait but a missed opportunity to show the Queen as a global figureSchoolchildren to be given bike number plates to stop irresponsible cycling Comment: The EU referendum has proved an unmitigated disaster – let’s not have a second oneTheresa May pledges to slash taxes to lowest rate in G20 to make Britain a post-Brexit economic powerhouse Corbyn in fresh anti-Semitism row over picture with activist who once asked: \u0026#39the Holocaust: yes or no?\u0026#39The Great British Bake Off 2018: Spice Week - no sign of Emma Bun Tin, but a booze overload and Hollywood goes soloOxford graduations delayed after women turned away for not wearing socksLefty teddy bears, Jellemy Corbeans and Proletarian Pear Drops: A video tour of the Labour conference centreFormer French PM Manuel Valls running for mayor of Barcelona on anti-independence ticketCost of a tank of petrol could soon hit record high of over £70, RAC warnsBill Cosby sentenced to three to 10 years in jail for sexual assaultComment: Iran will be harder than North Korea, Mr President - the ayatollahs are zealots, not politiciansLife expectancy falls in Scotland for first time in 35 yearsAttack on civilians threatens Ebola response in DRC\u0026#39Beginning of end\u0026#39 for Angela Merkel as chancellor defeated in party rebellionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/women/2018/05/29/TELEMMGLPICT000040906057_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=45","title":"eu judges spare meps blushes secretive expenses","story":"The European Parliament in Strasbourg, France: one of the two seats of the institution where MEPs can claim a daily allowance just for turning upEuropean Court of JusticeEU judges have refused to shed light on the European Parliament’s notoriously secretive system of expenses and claimed that doing so would infringe MEPs’ right to privacy.The £3,937 a month General Expenditure Allowance is paid directly into every MEP’s account on top of their monthly salary to cover expenses such as hotels, travel and restaurant bills.But there is no need to provide receipts or return unspent cash from the payment, which costs taxpayers across the EU an estimated £35.8 million a year.The General Court, a lower chamber of the European Court of Justice, on Tuesday rejected a case brought by a consortium of investigative journalists over the allowance.Judges in Luxembourg said making details public would violate MEPs’ privacy, backing a European Parliament decision to refuse the information request.The court also refused to allow the information to be handed over in a redacted format to avoid EU data protection rules.It said that would prove too burdensome on the parliament and render the request pointless because it would be impossible to monitor inidual MEPs’ expenditure.The consortium of investigative journalists found widespread abuses of the system in 2017, including payments to MEPs’ personal accounts. In many cases it was impossible to find out how money was spent because there was no paper trail.At a glance | European Court of JusticeThe court’s decision, which can be appealed,  sparked outrage among campaigners and some MEPs who want more transparency.Transparency International’s Nick Aiossa said, “The European Court of Justice has dealt a severe blow to transparency today by allowing the European Parliament to keep MEP allowance spending completely secret from the public.“At a time when trust in the EU institutions is so low, this is a ridiculous message ahead of next year’s European elections.”Conservative MEPs\u0027 leader Ashley Fox said that Tory MEPs had submitted their expenses for independent audit and published summaries of them for the last nine years.We believe the European Parliament should now demand that all MEPs copy this approach to restore and maintain public confidence in the system, he said.The European Parliament has long been criticised for its opaque expenses system, which top up the average £86,700 a year MEPs’ salary, which is subject to a “community tax” rate that can be as little as 12 per cent.As well as the General Expenditure Allowance, MEPs can pocket, without any need for a paper trail of receipts, a daily allowance of £280 simply for turning up to the parliament and signing a register. In July, the parliament rejected reforms that would have introduced basic scrutiny of the allowance. Brexit Bulletin promotion - end of articleEuropean Court of JusticePlease review our commenting policyUS-China relations crumble as disputes extend beyond trade warRepublican leader \u0026#39confident\u0026#39 Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed despite concerns of some senators Fury as council approves plans for driverless car test track on site of Battle of BosworthPolice in the dock for giving people the chance to spend Halloween in Fred West\u0026#39s cellComment: Are Theresa May\u0026#39s calls for a low-tax economy genuine, or is she trying to call the EU\u0026#39s bluff?Queen of the World, review: a fascinating portrait but a missed opportunity to show the Queen as a global figureSchoolchildren to be given bike number plates to stop irresponsible cycling Comment: The EU referendum has proved an unmitigated disaster – let’s not have a second oneTheresa May pledges to slash taxes to lowest rate in G20 to make Britain a post-Brexit economic powerhouse Corbyn in fresh anti-Semitism row over picture with activist who once asked: \u0026#39the Holocaust: yes or no?\u0026#39The Great British Bake Off 2018: Spice Week -

It also features subsidised bike lights and maintenance workshops.The school said in a statement: Our absolute priority is the safety of our students, and the aim of this initiative is simply to ensure their safety as they travel to and from school.Duncan Dollimore of charity Cycling UK questioned why Stanley Park High want to make cycling to school more difficult.He said: They should be looking to make active journeys easier and more attractive. Worryingly, this behaviour seems to be part of a trend of head teachers trespassing on parental responsibilities.Schools in Coventry, Surrey and St Albans recently began regulating what pupils wear while cycling, with a threat of bike confiscation if guidelines are ignored.The Government is proposing to introduce new legislation which will see cyclists who kill pedestrians treated in a similar way to dangerous drivers.The laws are part of a road safety consultation launched after 44-year-old mother-of-two Kim Briggs was knocked over and killed by a bicycle courier in February 2016.Department for Transport figures show that 448 pedestrians were killed on Britain\u0027s roads in 2016. Three cases involved collisions with bicycles.Please review our commenting policyUS-China relations crumble as disputes extend beyond trade warRepublican leader \u0026#39confident\u0026#39 Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed despite concerns of some senators Fury as council approves plans for driverless car test track on site of Battle of BosworthPolice in the dock for giving people the chance to spend Halloween in Fred West\u0026#39s cellComment: Are Theresa May\u0026#39s calls for a low-tax economy genuine, or is she trying to call the EU\u0026#39s bluff?Queen of the World, review: a fascinating portrait but a missed opportunity to show the Queen as a global figureComment: The EU referendum has proved an unmitigated disaster – let’s not have a second oneTheresa May pledges to slash taxes to lowest rate in G20 to make Britain a post-Brexit economic powerhouse Corbyn in fresh anti-Semitism row over picture with activist who once asked: \u0026#39the Holocaust: yes or no?\u0026#39The Great British Bake Off 2018: Spice Week -

But they come at a cost, and one that is not easy to swallow.And from Friday the Xs and Xs Max have gone on sale in the UK and around the world, meaning UK networks are battling to offer customers the best deals on the new iPhones.(The iPhone Xr, which might offer considerably better value for money, is not going to be released until October. It might be well worth waiting for: it has many of the same features as the Xs, but starts at £749 rather than £999.)Here are the various ways to buy an iPhone Xs now.Buying a phone is not necessarily the cheapest way of buying an iPhone, and it requires you to have the most amount of money to hand. But the flip side is that you get everything sorted out in one go, you won\u0027t have payments hanging over your head, and you\u0027re free to do what you want with the phone.iPhone XS launch in September 2018111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/17/11/aran-islands-cart-1950s-ireland.jpg","title":"travel ireland aran islands visit travel accommodation to do remote","story":"Created with Sketch.At the end of the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, playwright JM Synge\u0026nbspescaped to the\u0026nbspstripped back and simple life on\u0026nbspInishmore, Inishmaan\u0026nbspand Inisheer. Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”We both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/25/11/weetbix-weetabix.jpg","title":"new zealand weetabix boxes weetbix british sanitarium christchurch cereal","story":"Created with Sketch.Court rules that British product could be confused with Weet-BixClick to followThe IndependentScores of Weetabix boxes will be destroyed in New Zealand after the company behind rival breakfast brand\u0026nbspWeet-bix, won\u0026nbspa trademark dispute.Food manufacturer\u0026nbspSanitarium took the owners of\u0026nbspChristchurch grocers A Little Bit of Britain\u0026nbspto the country\u0027s High\u0026nbspCourt, where they claimed that\u0026nbspcustomers, largely expats\u0026nbspfrom the UK,\u0026nbspmight mistake the\u0026nbspBritish\u0026nbspproduct for its own.When a pallet of around 300 boxes of Weetabix\u0026nbsparrived in the country in June, they were impounded by customs officers following a complaint from\u0026nbspSanitarium.\u0026nbspKylie Jenner has only just tried adding milk to her cerealWeed-killing chemical linked to cancer found in children\u0027s cerealsYoung boy dies \u0027after mistaking father\u0027s meth for cereal\u0027The firm also\u0026nbspsent a letter to Lisa Wilson, the shop\u0027s co-owner, informing her that the cereal would\u0026nbsponly be released if a sticker was put over their labels\u0026nbspand she blanked out the name Weetabix when selling it online.While other stores complied with their request, Ms Wilson\u0026nbspaccused the company of “bullying” her small family business and refused to back down.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAs a result he said that\u0026nbspWeetabix can only be sold in specialist UK stores and the word must be covered to protect the Weet-Bix brand.A survey, released by the court found that 35 per cent of people mistook Weetabix as a Sanitarium product.Weetabix products imported for other than private or domestic use must be destroyed, meaning the 108 boxes which arrived earlier this year, had to be destroyed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSanitarium general manager Rob Scoines welcomed the ruling, saying that it was vital that the company protected their brand.It\u0027s not so much about Little Bit of Britain selling Weetabix, but more about the protection of the Weet-Bix trademark, Mr Scoines\u0026nbsptold The New Zealand Herald.\u0026nbspThe judgment enables us to protect our brand, which supports the employment of New Zealanders and contributes to the community.World news in picturesUS golfer Tiger Woods tees off during a practice session ahead of the 42nd Ryder Cup at Le Golf National Course at Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, south-west of ParisPresident Donald Trump and US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, talk with UN secretary general Antonio Guterres during the General Assembly at UN HeadquartersIranian President Hassan Rouhani has claimed that his country is ready to confront America, following an attack on a military parade in Ahvaz in which 25 people were killed.

The high street store called on the government to provide more clarity about its planning, to enable it to make suitable arrangements. The company said the “indirect risk of interruption to the smooth operation of our ports represents the biggest risk to our business from Brexit”. According to Next, there is no reason why goods should not flow with relatively little friction through customs from the EU, but the retailer said that the issue would be the preparedness of UK authorities and businesses.Another risk the company is facing is volatility in the pound. In a bid to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations, Next has secured\u0026nbspexchange rates in US dollars, its most important trading currency, for the next two years. In 2018, the costing rate is $1.29 per £1, and in 2019 the company expects to get $1.33 per £1. In early trading on Tuesday, the pound was at $1.31. Next said its decision to hedge exposure to the pound meant\u0026nbspit was not expecting any cost price inflation over the next 18 months.

It will stigmatise cyclists. Are they going to be targets?“It is going to reduce the number of children cycling to school.”Stanley Park High, which has promised pupils training in road awareness and bike maintenance and subsidised bike lights, is thought to be the first school in the country to propose licence plates for cyclists.The school has separately urged parents to park further from the school gates and to encourage their children to cycle to school to tackle traffic congestion.But Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns at Cycling UK, said the bike number plate plans would “make cycling to school more difficult”.He added: “Head teachers have a powerful voice in their community which they should use to encourage their local authorities to adopt 20mph speed limits and traffic calming measures on the streets their pupils are most likely to cycle on – this will make cycling safer for their pupils, not number plates on bikes.”Motoring groups and cycle campaigners have previously expressed concern about any moves to\u0026nbsproll out bicycle number plates.A survey carried out in November found a majority of the public backed the idea “to encourage responsible cycling”.But Edmund King, president of the AA, described the idea at the time as both “impractical and unnecessary” and said police already had powers to stop cyclists.Cycle campaigners also warned that the huge cost of implementing a system of licenced bikes would fall to taxpayers and such a move would undoubtedly deter people from riding their bicycles.In 2014 Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said cyclists should have the same identification as drivers so they can be prosecuted for jumping red lights.A change in the law would be required for number plates to become mandatory on bicycles, as the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 only provides for the registration of mechanically propelled vehicles.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/25/10/weather-cambridge-25-9-18.jpg  width= 2223  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/25/10/weather-cambridge-25-9-18.jpg","title":"uk weather forecast latest temperature sunshine autumn indian summer met office","story":"Created with Sketch.North-south split will see some\u0026nbspregions facing wet and windy conditionsClick to followThe IndependentUK weather: Sunshine and warmth to return to country as temperatures to rival GreeceTemperatures in Britain will rival parts of the Mediterranean this week as Britain enjoys\u0026nbspan extra burst of warmth and sunshine, despite the official arrival of autumn.Forecasters said the south and east of the UK could enjoy highs of 23C\u0026nbspon Thursday beating Athens and the Greek islands and matching Barcelona. The mercury could even rise by a degree or two more.\u0026nbspHowever, for northern regions of England and in Scotland, autumnal wet and windy weather is predicted to persist from Wednesday until the weekend.A cold start on Tuesday will give way to sunshine and highs of 18C. However, skies will cloud over in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with rain and gales expected, the Met Office said. It will also turn windier in northern England.By Wednesday it will turn increasingly warm in southeast England, although there will be persistent rain in the west and cloud and wind across the northern half of the UK.Thursday will be warmer still with real-feel temperatures of around 23C in London and the mercury topping 20C as far north as far north as Grimsby.Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said a plume of warmer air\u0026nbspblowing in from the Atlantic would see the south on Thursday potentially\u0026nbsplooking at 23C or higher.“Friday values continue but there is less certainty about what is going to happen there is a cold front that may push further south,” he told\u0026nbspThe Independent.But the warmth will dissipate across much of the UK by the weekend with highs of around 15C by Saturday.UK news in picturesShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer opens a debate on Brexit during the Labour Party\u0027s annual conference in LiverpoolThe European Parliament\u0027s Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt arriving in Downing Street, in London, for a meeting with Prime Minister Theresa MayLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has stated that he will support a second referendum on Brexit if the Labour membership votes for one at this week\u0027s party conference.

Does anybody seriously think the Spanish government, which would see hotel bookings collapse in 2019, is going to intervene to stop planes flying? Of course, they’re not.”But the new guidance admits airlines “would lose the automatic right to operate air services between the UK and the EU without seeking advance permission”.The inside story of

Brexit could also force passengers to re-screen luggage and go back through security on, for example, a flight to the UK via Paris or Amsterdam.The department for transport said its “preference” would be to agree “a basic arrangement or understanding” with the EU –\u0026nbsparguing Brussels had already said that would be desirable.Alternatively, it suggested “bilateral arrangements between the UK and an inidual EU country could be put in place, specifying the conditions under which air services would be permitted”.Under the pet passports scheme, which involves a rabies vaccination and a microchip, people can take their dogs, cats or ferrets to the EU and back again without quarantine.The technical notice said the UK is pressing to become a “listed” third country after Brexit, to avoid “burdensome” new requirements.But it admitted that designation as an “unlisted” third country would leave\u0026nbsppet-owners having to discuss travelling with their animals to EU countries with

immigration","story":"Created with Sketch.UN says 2.3 million people have left the country since 2015, but those without a passport are unable to escapeClick to followThe Independent USPeople wait in line outside Saime offices in Caracas  After a year struggling to make ends meet under Venezuela’s crushing hyperinflation, Jennyfer and her boyfriend decided to flee the country. Everything was ready, except a small but important detail: Jennyfer’s passport.It is now five months since Jennyfer Avero applied for her travel document. But, until today, the 23-year-old craftswoman from Caracas hasn’t anything about the state of her request.\u0026nbspLast month, her boyfriend Javier left for\u0026nbspEcuador, becoming part of one of the biggest exoduses in Latin American history. And in the meantime, Jennyfer continues to wait, hoping she will join him soon.“I have no alternative,” she says. “I wouldn’t like to leave without a passport.”Venezuela’s intensifying economic and political crisis has pushed hundreds of thousands to flee the country. They are in search of food, security, medicine and jobs.But not everyone\u0026nbspthat makes the decision to leave has a valid passport. Venezuelans face multiple difficulties when trying to obtain this document. Some people can wait months, or even years, to get it. The process can be complicated, expensive and sometimes illegal.Day after day crowds queue up outside the headquarters of the passport agency, known as Saime, in Caracas.Saime has more than 200 offices nationwide, however many people come to the headquarters in Caracas hoping to get a passport. Here the possibilities are greater, users say.Everyone is here – women, children, couples and elderly people. Some arrived before dawn\u0026nbspothers, those who came from afar, spent the night here. Much of them share the desire to leave the country for good.“This is the fourth time in three months I’ve come here,” says Jose Di Marco, while standing in line.Di Marco travelled 713km by bus from the town of Puerto Ordaz to Caracas. For the second consecutive day, the 20-year-old student has been sleeping at a nearby square to avoid losing his spot in the queue.He should be travelling to Ecuador at the end of the month. He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.“I’ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time,” he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory, the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.“It’s as if I had never attended the appointment,” says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her meeting.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It’s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Caracas’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest in the region, so it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 (£0.23) at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans,given the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the “mafia”\u0026nbspinside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his critics for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a “crisis moment”,\u0026nbspakin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans who had been travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/06/12/delhi-airport.jpg","title":"plane passenger opens door toilet goair india flight delhi patna","story":"Created with Sketch.Police say there was \u0027pandemonium\u0027 when fellow passengers saw the man, a banker in his twenties,\u0026nbsptrying to open the door while the plane was mid-airClick to followThe IndependentFile: An aircraft belonging to GoAir Airlines flies over a residential area in south-west DelhiA passenger flying for the first time sparked panic on a flight in India when he tried to open the rear exit of the plane, mistaking it for the door to the toilet.A police spokesman said the man in his late twenties was seen by fellow passengers, and when challenged he “told them he needed to use the washroom urgently and kept tugging at the exit door”.Cabin crew on the GoAir flight from Delhi to Patna, northeast India were forced to wrestle the man away from the door, according to Indian media reports, and he was persuaded to take a seat for the remainder of the flight before being handed over to airport security upon arrival.A spokesperson for GoAir told The Independent the incident took place on the 1hr 45mins flight G8 149 to Patna on Saturday evening. The plane landed safely.“A passenger was trying to open the rear door of the aircraft while in the air,” the spokesperson said. “A co-passenger raised the alarm and he was intercepted by the crew.

That claim was contradicted by an airline source, who said the doors cannot be unlocked when there is a big difference in pressure between the cabin and outside the plane.CISF escorted the man off the plane upon arrival at Patna and handed him over to local police, who questioned him about his motives.Sanowar Khan, the officer in charge of the local police, said there was “pandemonium” on the plane when the young man, a banker and first-time flier, started trying to open the door.Khan told The  newspaper: “People asked him why he was doing so (trying to open the exit gate). He told them that he needed to use the washroom urgently and kept tugging at the exit door. Pandemonium prevailed amid all this and he was restrained and finally handed over to us. He said that the confusion happened because he had boarded a flight for the first time in his life.”Police checked the man’s records to confirm he had never flown before, and released him later that evening.Times of IndiaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1022533_1.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn labour jean luc melenchon","story":"                Labour on track to deliver \u0027HARDEST Brexit\u0027 if Jeremy Corbyn does THIS                Corbyn ally boasts of setting alarm EARLY \u0027to hate Margaret Thatcher\u0027\u0026ldquoBritish governments have always had an extremely arrogant and unpleasant attitude towards other Europeans and Europe, for its part, has always been odious to all its people.

Scientists fear RADIATION threatens NASA\u0027s future missions to Mars                Japan rovers send back first pictures after landing on ASTEROIDBut this new study identities two more factors for the changes, which the researchers behind the paper believe play an equal part in influencing the Earth\u0026rsquos spin.Glacial rebound occurs when heavy glaciers, like the sort which covered huge parts of the planet during the last ice age, cause the Earth\u0027s surface to bulge slightly.As the ice melted, the land - and the surface of the Earth - was slowly restored to its previous shape.Because the process is so slow, the planet is still \u0026lsquorebounding\u0026rsquo from the last ice age around 21,000 years ago. Scientists previously believed this process was responsible for the entire wobble of the Earth.NASA scientists have discovered humans are responsible for an increase in the Earth\u0027s \u0027wobble\u0027 (Image:  IMAGESNASAJPL-Caltech)Ice melting into the sea, particularly from Greenland, is contributing to the increased wobble (Image:  IMAGES)                 Is NASA photo of \u0026lsquoalien statue\u0026rsquo on Mars evidence of UFOs on Mars?The first of the newly discovered factors is something called \u0026ldquomantle convection.This process drives the movement of tectonic plates on the surface of the planet but NASA now believes it also impacts the Earth\u0026rsquos wobble.The second cause is the melting of ice, particularly on Greenland, which the researchers believe accounts for around 33 percent of the wobble effect.And the process is being accelerated as humans artificially warm the environment.NASA estimates a massive 7,500 gigatons of Greenland\u0027s ice has melted into the ocean in the 20th century.NASA discovered the Earth\u0027s wobble has shifted by more than 10 metres over the past century (Image:  IMAGES)The transfer of weight from Greenland to other parts of the globe has caused Earth to wobble more than it would have otherwise.Explaining the findings, Surendra Adhikari of NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said: \u0026ldquoThe traditional explanation is that one process, glacial rebound, is responsible for this motion of Earth\u0027s spin axis.\u0026ldquoBut recently, many researchers have speculated that other processes could have potentially large effects on it as well.\u0026ldquoWe identified not one but three sets of processes that are crucial -- and melting of the global cryosphere (especially Greenland) over the course of the 20th century is one of them.

Heres the latest.While a number of politicians and celebrities have added their voice to growing calls for a second referendum this has always been rejected by Downing Street.In September 2018 the mayor of Manchester Andy Burnham backed a second Brexit vote  there was a no-deal scenario - but warned it could trigger social unrest.Theresa Mays official spokesman has said: The British people have voted to leave the EU and there is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.It could depend on how Brits perceive Parliamentary squabbles over Mrs Mays Chequers deal.Theresa May called on Jeremy Corbyn to rule out a second vote on EU membership during PMQs, but the Labour leader failed to respond.Labour has been in a muddle over the issue too — with the leadership refusing to commit to a call for a second vote despite cries from centrist MPs and members.A sizeable section in the party want a second referendum and pressure is mounting on the left-wing leader.The GMB, one of the UKs biggest trade unions, called for a vote on the final Brexit deal.Later in September 2018, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan dramatically called for another EU referendum — saying that people must be given the opportunity to reject Brexit.The Mayor of London, who is an avowed remainer, argued Britain is facing either a bad deal or “no deal” which he says will hit jobs and living standards.Referring to the worst case scenerios, Mr Khan said: “They are both incredibly risky and I don’t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people’s livelihoods.” Party bosses have hinted theyll back a second referendum - but Jeremy Corbyns closest ally, John McDonnell, has ruled out keeping Britain in the EU.Labour bigwigs set out a new policy which could see the party supporting a fresh referendum  Theresa May refuses to call a General Election.But the policy was blown apart just hours later when Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell suggested the second referendum wouldnt include an option to remain in the EU.Speaking on the BBC’s Today programme, the hard-left veteran said: “We’ve said we want a people’s vote  we can’t get a General Election.“We accept the last referendum - we want a General Election,  we can’t get that we want some form of democratic option.”Asked what form a second referendum would take, Mr McDonnell said: “It will be on the deal itself. We will respect the referendum.”Speaking to ITVs Good Morning Britain, he added: It will be about whether you accept the deal or not or whether you send people back to negotiate a proper deal.And he told BBC Radio 5 Live: My big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  its slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.Following John McDonnells comments, Labours Shadow Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Keir Starmer reaffirmed that the party have not ruled out calling for a second Brexit referendum.Ahead of a vote at the party conference on Tuesday September 25, the shadow Brexit secretary said that a motion on the highly isive question that has dominated the event in Liverpool doesnt rule out Remain.He told the Independent: The idea is to retain flexibility, the motion doesnt rule out Remain, it doesnt tie us to any position on what should be in any future vote.It was reported that he is due to tell the party conference in Liverpool: The party that once promised to fix the roof while the sun was shining now seems intent on burning the whole house down.Just when we need a strong government, what do we see from the Tories? Division, chaos and failure.No credible plan for Brexit. No solution to prevent a hard border in Ireland. And no majority in Parliament for the Chequers proposals.A Tory civil war that has gone on for years now threatens our future prosperity.Its reported he will add: If your party wants to tear itself apart, thats fine, but youre not taking our country with you.Setting out Labours approach to the upcoming Commons vote, Sir Keir said: If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests - and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No s, no buts.And  the Prime Minister thinks well wave through a vague deal asking us to jump blindfolded into the unknown, she can think again.You cant meet Labours tests by failing to provide answers. We will vote down a blind Brexit.Let me be clear: this isnt about frustrating the process. Its about stopping a destructive Tory Brexit. Its about fighting for our values. And about fighting for our country.According to Oddschecker, BetFred have offered offs of 9/4 for a second referendum on leaving the EU.A poll carried out by NatCen and The UK in Changing Europe revealed 59 percent of voters would now vote to remain in the EU, while 41 percent would opt to leave.The author of the poll John Curtice urged caution over the finding.He said the interview panel was skewed towards remain, and that some of the sht was among those who did not take part in the original Brexit referendum.The first referendum on EU membership took place in 1975.Two-thirds of voters  backed the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before. Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a better deal.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in 1993.In the summer of 2016, Britain voted to leave the EU after 17.4million people backed Leave compared to 16.1million Remain voters.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Gone,  was the mantra that there is no alternative to the Chequers proposal, which so angered all of us who have campaigned for Brexit.Yet instead, two things emerged. The first that the Prime Minister was clearly angered by their treatment of her.Regardless of their views on Chequers, she has the right to believe that as the UK has always treated the EU with respect, so EU leaders should show the UK the same respect in .Second is what I and others have been saying, that the best and most workable relationship after we leave is one based on a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.However,  we are to reach such an agreement, the EU must recognise that they will have to get rid of the demands for a Northern Irish border backstop, which blocks such a deal.The EU demand that either the UK as a whole stay in the Customs Union or that Northern Ireland is separated from the UK by a customs border is unacceptable and would harm our Union.In fact, a recent publication by two ex-Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland shows that there does not need to be a “hard” border with checkpoints or gates, and instead we could have a practical solution where goods flow freely between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In fact, such a system should be employed at all our borders around the UK, as this would greatly reduce the likelihood of customs problems at ports from Zeebrugge to Calais.So after months of manoeuvring, and poor advice from advisers in No10, now the choice is at least — and at last — crystal clear.The UK wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU but they need to cease demands about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Failing that, the UK will leave under terms which govern trade between nations around the world.No trade deal is better than a bad trade deal, so the ball is firmly in the EU’s court.By Priti Patel, Tory former Cabinet ministerOUTRAGEOUS, insulting and immature sums up the EU’s appalling behaviour to the UK and to our Prime Minister.These shenanigans from an out-of-touch EU elite serve to demonstrate why Britain was right to vote leave.Who wants to remain in a club where its senior unelected figures mock our great and proud country and shamefully ambush our PM?Not only has Britain bankrolled the EU for the past 45 years, the freedoms and liberties enjoyed by the Continent have been secured by our Armed Forces and the sacrices Britain made in two world wars.While we want to maintain strong, friendly and cordial relations with our friends and partners in Europe, Donald Tusk belittles the PM on social media and President Macron brands those who back Brexit as “liars”.Macron’s undiplomatic comments are an insult not only to the 17.4million people who backed Brexit but to the entire country.Their aim is simple. To reverse the result of the referendum and put Brussels back in charge.The British people deserve better than the EU humiliating and insulting us.We are a proud nation and will not stand for a Government that surrenders to unreasonable demands from Europe’s unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. This Government has already gone too far, with Chequers offering the EU control over large parts of our law-making.The sad fact about the position the Government is now in is that it was advised to “chuck Chequers” and pursue an alternative course of free and open trade.However, this is not the moment to cower and compromise further.Salzburg should mark the moment when we decide as a country to press ahead with taking back full control over our destiny.Our generous overtures of a £40billion orce payment, remaining an EU rule taker and compromise have been spurned and the EU is resorting to insults.So it’s time the Government realised this and “got real” on Brexit.Britain must take back control of these negotiations and send the EU a signal it will understand loud and clear.We must take the £40billion off the table and remind the EU there are serious consequences to their appalling behaviour and this will hit them hard.If they want to negotiate then we should offer them a take-it-or-leave-it, Canada-plus-style free trade deal, which is an economic prize for the UK and our trading partners.We leave the EU in six months and instead of wasting time accommodating its belligerent attitude, now is the time to unite the nation, believe in Britain and let the EU know that Brexit really does mean Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until now, Jezza — a staunch Bennite eurosceptic — has resisted any move to overturn Brexit. Yesterday, in a remarkable U-turn, he vowed to accept whatever delegates say.So abject surrender to the mob is the price he will pay to destroy Theresa May. “I enjoy being leader,” he said yesterday. “I am carrying on as leader of the Labour Party because I want to win an election.”His persistence in the face of scathing personal ratings is the only glint of sunlight for stricken Tories.Under any other leader, even snooty wannabe Emily Thornberry, Labour would be miles ahead.But we have learned not to underestimate Corbyn.The People’s Vote movement probably has the numbers in Parliament to vote down any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels.These so-called “moderates”, including the slippery Peter Mandelson, leadership flop David Miliband and decrepit Vince Cable, should be careful what they wish for.In normal times, the Tories would beat off the Momentum marauders. But for all her brave talk in Downing Street last week, Mrs May is a real political liability.She destroyed both her credibility and her majority in last year’s unforced contest.The public mood on Brexit is volatile and unpredictable.Most people believe the majority for Brexit, fuelled by EU arrogance and plain bad manners, could actually grow. But nobody’s sure.A snap election would focus the public’s attention on the choice between a clean break and a botched compromise which will never be acceptable to all sides.It could cauterise the issue which still ides families and friends. Or it could backfire badly.Tory Brexiteers must think hard before pulling the plug on the Maybot. It could split their party asunder.But so could Jeremy Corbyn’s rank opportunism.Blairite Labour moderates must soon choose.If they help Jeremy Corbyn win a vote of no confidence, what do they do next?Will they campaign for a party whose rampant extremists wish them dead? Will they stay silent while Momentum activists unseat their moderate comrades?Can deputy Tom Watson support a leader whose own MPs need round-the-clock armed guards against his dangerously fanatical supporters?Can they ignore threats of rape and torture? Nothing is too extreme or too petty for these thugs. They even want ex-Labour luvvie Maureen Lipman sacked from Corrie for attacking their Beloved Leader.Anyone who thinks images of Marxist anarchy are far-fetched should listen to Corbyn sidekick Dawn Butler praising the 1980s Militant Tendency — the forerunner to Momentum — which almost bankrupted Merseyside.“We are in Liverpool where over 30 years ago the council stood up to Thatcher and said, better to break the law than break the poor,” she ranted.That was when Labour split asunder for the first time, creating a new Social Democrat party which posed a short-lived threat the Tories.Roy Hattersley, deputy leader in those turbulent times, warns the party could split again today. “All we need is for one of the hard-working, long-suffering MPs to be kicked out and the whole thing will blow up in our faces,” he said yesterday.The Tories just need to be patient.Albanian drug gangs are gaining market share from Bulgarians, Romanians and Colombians by slashing cocaine prices.Police arrested a record 4,000 peddlers operating across county lines, mostly too young to charge.Kne crime among Somalis, Eritreans and Nigerians is soaring.Meanwhile, there’s a growth spurt in modern slavery.Organised crime is a multi-billion-pound industry affecting “more UK citizens, more often, than any other national security threat,” says the National Crime Agency.All despite Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Deal, or no dough.LABOUR’S position on Brexit is clear as mud, but we know one thing they do believe: the Press needs muzzling.From the moment Jeremy Corbyn told us that “change is coming”, the media has come under attack after attack from a leader who is playing the man — not the ball — when it comes to those asking him legitimate questions.Union strongman Len McCluskey accused the media of “vicious attacks” on the Labour Party.But it’s not an “attack” to ask Corbyn, a man who wants to be PM, why he spent his holidays visiting a terrorists’ cemetery in Tunisia or why he invited the IRA for tea and treats in Parliament.Nor is it just the tactics of the hated “mainstream media” to ask John McDonnell whether his extremist economics will actually work in the real world..Today’s announcement on employee ownership appears appealing for workers, but it would only hit investment and productivity in the long-term.If this Labour Party gains power, the free Press — and the economy — would be in serious danger.IS Anthony Joshua now the UK’s most impressive sportsman?His win over Alexander Povetkin at a packed-out Wembley was stunning.It’s now on to Fury and Wilder.Beat those two, and he might go down as Britain’s best ever boxer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But she implored: “Now is the time to hold our nerve”.The PM was backed by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab straight after the meeting, who dubbed it “a good, healthy discussion”.He added: “The Prime Minister made clear we are going to keep our calm and press the EU on some of the criticisms  they have made.

It’s time to put ideology to one side and listen.”But  pro-EU Tory MPs  stepped up their calls for an alternative Brexit plan at the same time as hardline Brexiteer Tories did.

Its out of range and probably distressed. People rushing to the site in boats or with drones will only disturb the whale and cause it more distress.If you wish to see the whale for yourself, stay on the shore and do not get in the water.The last time a whale was spotted in the River Thames was a bottlenose whale, now known as the River Thames Whale.In January 2006 a female northern bottlenose whale swam up the Thames and caused hysteria in London.She sadly died during a rescue mission near Battersea.A spokesperson for Whale and Dolphin Conservation said: Belugas are High Arctic species and this one is thousands of miles from where it should be! Belugas are usually associated close to the ice in places like Greenland, Svalbard or the Barents Sea.He or she is obviously very lost and quite possibly in trouble. There are a few reports of belugas in the UK in recent years.In the summer of 2015 two were spotted off the Northumberland coast and one in Northern Ireland.

speculation that the doomed aircraft may have landed in the Indian Ocean.Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and was heading to Beijing with 239 people on board when it disappeared in March 2014.Mr Vance claims evidence suggests Shah tried to ditch the plane as gently as possible to avoid creating wreckage that would make it easier to find.But Peter Foley, who heads the Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigation into MH370 said the section of the aircraft’s wing known as the flap found in Tanzania disproves that theory.The outboard flap of the Boeing 777 aircraft extends on an internal support track and investigators have discovered the track has left impact marks inside the flap.That could only have happened  was in a retracted position, strong evidence that the plane was in its cruising state when it fell into the sea.“The section of main flap was found in Tanzania Pemba island in 2016 and when imagery was passed to us we realised it was pretty signicant,” Foley told National Geographic’s Drain the Oceans documentary.“It’s been the subject of a lot of debate but the hard physical evidence and our analysis shows that is that it wasn’t a controlled ditch there or that there was active control from the cockpit extending the flaps at the time the flap separated from the aircraft.”The programme said MH370 plunged into a “death spiral” in its final moments before smashing into the Indian Ocean after running out of fuel.A never-before-seen reconstruction of the jets final moments claims the plane continued to exchange signals with a satellite, known as Inmarsat, above the Indian Ocean, despite being lost to radar.The signals occurred once an hour and experts were able to use this to calculate its direction of travel.They established that after its initial track to the northwest, MH370 turned south and flew for six more hours.Further analysis of the Inmar satellite showed that in its final moments the plane descended rapidly, almost certainly because it ran out of fuel.Engineers then conducted a simulation of what happens when a Boeing 777 runs out of fuel, making it possible to recreate the final moments of the mysterious flight.According to Drain The Oceans, the right engine flamed out first, the autopilot compensated for the imbalance with a hard left turn, then the second engine flamed out minutes later.With no power, the autopilot shut down, leaving MH370 in a “long spiral descent”.The idea that Shah was attempting a controlled landing has been dismissed by aviation expert Christine Negroni as preposterous and absurd.:Drain The Oceans: Malaysia  Airlines  370 airs on National Geographic this Thursday, 27 September at 8pm."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436830259.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"639\" width=\"960","title":"diane abbott gets her numbers wrong

But I think we’re going to get on.”She was right. We did. The other panellists liked her too.Predominantly mothers, we treated her as one might a naughty niece you were particularly fond of, rolling our eyes and smiling affectionately as she regaled us with the latest relationship drama in her le.But despite her no-nonsense, often humorous delivery, there was always a faint “here we go again” sadness behind her eyes and, as I saw it, a low self-esteem that might explain the constant cosmetic alterations and propensity to criticise herself before anyone else could.After reading the recent headlines of wild nights out and rap songs about cocaine, it’s easy to think that Katie is a party girl who has largely abandoned her children as an inconvenience to the carefree lestyle she longs to have.And, judging by yesterday’s letters page, plenty of you do.Before getting to know her, I might have shared that view. But now I see her admittedly destructive behaviour as a cry for help and I’m relieved that, finally, she’s in to rehab to get it.Once, in a rare flash of what I feel is the real Katie, she told me that her Holy Grail was to find a decent, dependable man who could pay the bills while she stayed home and ran a large, chaotic farmhouse full of children and animals.Her favourite night of the week was Friday, when she would wipe off her “work face”, slip in to her old trackie bottoms and call in a takeaway for her, her now estranged third husband Kieran and the kids.Anyone who has seen her interacting with Harvey, her severely disabled eldest son, will know that she’s a fundamentally devoted mother doing her best  in often trying circumstances.Remember her in the I’m A Celebrity jungle? Free of make-up, her hair in braids, tackling each challenge with an admirably no-nonsense bravado? To my mind, that’s the real Katie — the rest is just noise.But without doubt, she has a self-destructive streak when she feels let down.So, after catching Kieran having an affair with her “best friend”, forgiving him, then catching him again with someone else, it was inevitable that a fall was coming. Her mum Amy said at the weekend: “Kate has been her own worst enemy and behaved like an idiot at times but she has been tearing herself apart for years.“All the men in her le have used Katie, and never, ever leave her alone . . . Kieran almost destroyed Kate with his behaviour, Alex  has been as bad, and Pete  likes to portray himself as perfect . . . they all know that  they wind her up, she will react.“Kate is stupid for reacting, but these men need to look at how they are behaving and take some responsibility.”Wise words. And Katie needs to heed them as much as her former husbands.She’s always been disarmingly frank about the incidents in her le that would have sent many of us over the edge — not least being sexually abused when she was just six years old. But now it’s time for her to stop shrugging them off as “just one of those things” and take a long, hard look at how they’ve shaped her often destructive behaviour patterns as an adult.I hope she sticks with the therapy and, ultimately, finds contentment.HOT on the stilettos of Stormy Daniels’ lurid description of Donald Trump’s manhood, singer Cher has been regaling us with tales of her former lovers.Tom Cruise is in her “top five” but legendary lothario Warren Beatty was, apparently, a disappointment.Cher, 72, explains: “Not that he wasn’t technically good, but I didn’t feel anything.”We remain blissfully unaware of whether she means emotionally or physically.EAGLE-EYED travellers boarding a flight operated by Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacic noticed this glaring spelling error on the side of the plane.Though it grieves me greatly, spelling errors or “typos” are now commonplace in everyday exchanges via text, tweet or email, but it never ceases to amaze me when they’re writ large on something as expensive as a sign, billboard or, er, Boeing 747.Does no one check these things before literally advertising their ignorance? Seems not.And so, we are entertained by such gems as Shoplters Will Be Prostituted, Chris Is Risen, All Busniesses Open As Usual, Pay and Display Apples In This Area, Costumers Only, Parrallel Parking, No Trough Road and Pedestrain Crossing, to name but a few.And don’t even get me started on missing or misplaced apostraffy’s…WHEN cookery presenter Nadiya Hussain was picked to bake the Queen’s birthday cake in 2016, she recalls feeling that it was an opportunity to act against Islamophobia.“Everybody thinks it, ‘Oh God, who let the Muslim woman near the Queen with a kne?’” she says now. “Let’s address that elephant in the room, because they did.”Nope. Actually, I remember thinking, “Oh, it’s that lovely woman who won Bake Off and made Mary Berry cry tears of joy”.Sorry to disappoint, Nadiya.Quite right too.Particularly as the majority of them are now more recognisable than the “celebrities” they’re dancing with.HOLLYWOOD director Sam Mendes says his now defunct marriage to Kate Winslet struggled because he “was not very comfortable being married to a celebrity . . . it made me feel self-conscious”.Couldn’t he have worked that out before they trotted down the aisle?VIDEO game designers are working on giving avatars real-le emotions to make the experience more authentic.Will they include a frustrated parent yelling: “Get off that bloody thing before you turn in to someone with the physical and people skills of an atrophied three-toed sloth?No, thought not.ACTRESS Helena Bonham Carter says she used a psychic to contact Princess Margaret so she could perfect her role as the Queen’s sister in the forthcoming third series of The Crown.She claims Margaret told her she’s “doing a great job”.Hmmm. From what little one knows of the feisty royal, “fack orf” seems more likely.FRANK SPRINGETT is 91, his we Mary is 86 and they have been married for 67 years.Frank is deaf and suffers from arthritis, Mary has severe Alzheimer’s, and both are being looked after in the same Warwickshire-based care home using funds from the sale of their house.However, the money is now running low and while social services will continue to partially pay for Mary’s care, it says former factory worker Frank has to look after himself.Meaning that 70 years after they met, they face being separated for the first time.“We fear  they are torn apart, the strain will kill them,” says their daughter Joanne, 57.With seemingly endless funds being readily shelled out to help accommodate those  who seek asylum in Britain, how sad that someone who has paid in to the system all their le gets so let down when they need it most.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In a barnstorming conference speech in Liverpool, she warned members that  they “truly want to ... unite the human race and re-unite our country, then again we must start with uniting our own party”. She demanded an end to the “pointless conflicts which ide our movement, which poison our online debate, and which distract us from fighting the Tories”.  Warning activists not to use support for Palestinians as a cloak for anti-Semitism, emotional Ms Thornberry said: “Let me speak to you from the depths of my heart and my soul and say something I never thought I’d have to say in my letime as a Labour member and activist, and it is simply this - that  we want to root out fascism and racism and hatred from our world, and from our country, then we must start - we must start - with rooting it out of our own party. “We all support the Palestinian cause, we are all committed to recognise the Palestinian State, and I stand here with no hesitation when I condemn the Netanyahu government for its racist policies and its criminal actions against the Palestinian people.  “But I know as well, and we must all acknowledge, that there are sickening iniduals on the fringes of our movement, who use our legitimate support for Palestine as a cloak and a cover for their despicable hatred of Jewish people, and their desire to see Israel destroyed. “Those people stand for everything that we have always stood against and they must be kicked out of our party the same way Oswald Mosley was kicked out of Liverpool.”     Labour\u0027s summer was overshadowed by claims of anti-Semitism after the party initially failed to adopt internationally-recognised examples of abuse.

The Labour leader is to use his speech at the party conference to announce a huge expansion in free childcare for hard-pressed families. Mr Corbyn will also outline plans for nationalisation of industries run by greedy bosses only interested in profits, boost workers’ pay and launch a drive for 400,000 green jobs as he sets about rebuilding a Britain for “the many not the few”. In a pledge of “real hope” he is to offer 30 hours of \u0026shy“genuinely free” childcare to all parents of two, three and four-year-olds in England. At the moment it is only for the two older age groups in term time. And there will be a boost in pay and skill levels of childcare staff.  Mr Corbyn will tell delegates in Liverpool: “Opportunity matters most in the earliest years of le. “It is a crucial time to open up children’s le chances. Driving up standards of childcare will make that vital dference for millions of our children.” Labour will also offer extra, means-tested subsidised hours on top of the free allowance. These will be free for households earning less than \u0026pound16,000 and cost no more than \u0026pound4 an hour for those on higher incomes of \u0026pound66,000 and more. There will be a sliding scale of fees in between. A source said there would be no limit to the number of extra hours a family could claim. But the \u0026pound4.8billion package of reforms has been costed by \u0026shyestimating how many hours would be taken up. Mr Corbyn will also hit out at the reckless capitalism that brought about the crash of 2008.  He is to say: “Ten years ago this month, the whole edice of greed is good, deregulated financial \u0026shycapitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences. “But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the \u0026shypolitical and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash. “People in this country know, they showed that in June last year, that the old way of running things isn’t working any more. That’s why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.” As well as announcing plans to save the NHS from its wilful Tory destruction, Mr Corbyn will tell of his ambitious plan to launch a green jobs revolution as he vows to tackle climate change.  He is to say: “There is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example. “Our energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations. “That means working with unions representing the workforce to ensure jobs and skills are protected as we move towards a low-carbon economy. And it means working with industry to change the way we build, and to train the workforce to retrofit homes and work in the industries we will build. “I can announce that Labour will kickstart a green jobs revolution. “Our programme of transformation to achieve a 60% reduction in \u0026shyemissions by 2030 will create over 400,000 skilled jobs, based here and on union rates, bringing skills and security to communities held back for too long.” Mr Corbyn will rally the party by telling members to prepare for a snap election in case Theresa May is destroyed by Brexit. Speaking ahead of his speech, the 69-year-old vowed to carry on as leader to oversee his rebuilding programme.

Ms Nandy, who has spent time visiting towns to analyse the problems they face, said she blamed the decline of industry but also a series of decisions by the last Labour government arguing that those who could went off to university “often the first in their family to do it but when they looked back they saw increasingly there was nothing to come back to”.  The Wigan MP delivered a powerful message saying: “These are not ghost towns, they are not dying, they are strong ambitious communities, they have more ambition for their lives and their communities than we have for them nationally.”  The Daily Mirror’s Alison Phillips explained how she had been inspired to start the paper’s High Street Fightback campaign after receiving hundreds of letters from readers devastated by the impact their decaying town centre was having on their lives and community. The General Secretary of the shopworkers’ union USDAW Paddy Lillis said he “absolutely welcomes” the campaign. He said “real families” were depended on the high street and its shops and when they closed down they had a “huge impact on the local community”. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told how the value added by “real people” rather than automated checkouts for both customers and retailers. He spoke passionately about the experience his mum had spending 30 years behind the counter at BHS.  “Although automation will come in and all the rest of it but people will demand a level of customer care that robots will never be able to provide.  “When she was at the biscuit counter in BHS people would come and have a chat to her and you end up with satisfied customers - and it isn’t just old people.” Bill Gimsey, Ex-Wickes and Iceland boss, told the event he had spent 45 years in retailing and he “spent my entire career in the last century alongwith my peer group cloning the highstreet and turning it into the mishmash of wasteland we have today. The ‘highstreet tsar’ added: “My passion in le now that I have grandchildren to correct that legacy.”  The former retail boss has written two reports off his own back addressing these problems and he is highly critical on the government’s failure to act on this topic. “You cannot save towns by concentrating on retail as your main strategy for the future it won’t work. “You have to recognise that we are changing as a society driven by technology and the absolute craving for convenience that is going to result in a pretty successful out of town proposition that is convenient and easy to get to and a current 18% of sales to 30% of sales by 2030 at the very latest.  “Trying to resurrect towns based on a shopping proposition is not going to work. “What is going to work is to try and recognise that we need to recreate our towns as community hubs based on health, education, leisure, entertainment, arts, crafts and housing. “If we repopulate our towns in this way then guess what you’ll get shops too.” Therese Grfin MEP, who represents the North West, told the fringe how Liverpool went to the European Union after a Tory minister told the city it could go into “managed decline”. She said: “At that point most of the city centre was in a fairly dire state.  “So we actually went to Europe over the heads of the then Government and it was European investment and solidarity that actually transformed Liverpool.  But she stressed that “it wasn’t just about infrastructure, it was about training and it was about training money that also had tied to it for example childcare money which allowed a lot of women to  into the workplace.”  At its conference Labour announced a five point plan to tackle the problem.  It includes scrapping ATM charges and halting Post office and bank office closures.

A conservation expert said the appearance of the whale is very, very unusual and said there could be a number of reasons for its arrival. The British Divers Marine Le Rescue  team, dedicated to rescuing marine animals in distress around the UK, are monitoring the situation and sending a representative to the scene - although the whale has not been spotted for around 45 minutes.  Lucy Babey, head of science and conservation at ORCA, said: This is the most southerly sighting of a beluga we have ever seen around these shores. The last sighting in UK waters was in 2015 when they were spotted near the Northumberland coastline, but they left shortly afterwards. Belugas usually travel in pods but this creature could have separated for a number of reasons. It\u0027s possible that the animal could be disorientated after becoming unwell. Storms or environmental disturbances may also have contributed.  Dave Andrews posted footage online showing the creature popping out of the water a number of times. He says he spotted the whale off Coalhouse Fort in East Tilbury, Essex, as it hunted food around barges east of London. Mr Andrews wrote online that he had been watching the whale for a few hours, and it was still swimming in the river on Tuesday afternoon. But experts expressed concerns for the whale\u0027s health, telling people to give it space.  Marine le rescuers said a beluga whale almost certainly entered the Thames, and they urged the public to keep their distance for its own safety, the BBC reported. The RSPCA statement read: “The RSPCA is aware of reports of a whale - possibly a beluga - in the Thames. We are working with other agencies to monitor the situation and ready to provide appropriate assistance  requested.” Mr Andrews tweeted: Can\u0027t believe I\u0027m writing this, no joke - BELUGA in the Thames off Coalhouse Fort. For anyone twitching the #BELUGA its been feeding around the barges  for the last hour and hasn\u0027t moved more than 200m in either direction. Still present.    Norfolk-based Mr Andrews is a consultant ecologist and ornithologist, according to his Twitter profile. Tanya Ferry, environment manager at the Port of London Authority which is monitoring the whale, said it was unclear what the whale could eat, reports the BBC. If they are eating things like jellyfish, we don\u0027t tend to have a great deal of jellyfish in the Thames, but we do have quite a lot of plastic bags, which could be quite an issue, she said. We\u0027re hoping  we give it enough space and keep an eye on it, it will find its own way out of the Thames to an environment that\u0027s more appropriate for it. We certainly don\u0027t want people trying to rescue it. Beluga whales are commonly found in the Arctic Ocean, where they feed on fish and crustaceans, but have been known to migrate south to warmer waters. In August and September 2015, Sea Watch Foundation reported beluga whale sightings off the coast of Northumberland and Tyne and Wear. Rare Bird Alert tweeted: Beluga Whale in the #thames today! Live updates available on our app as and when we get them.    One Twitter user commented: Almost unbelievably, it would seem that there is currently a beluga whale in the Thames! A beluga whale sighting in the Thames is extraordinarily rare. Tuesday\u0027s sighting sparked concerns for the creature\u0027s health. Sarah Dolman, of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, wrote on Twitter: Probably not good that this beluga is in the Thames. Please give the whale space! One person tweeted: As amazing as a beluga whale in the river Thames is, It poses a potentially tragic fate for it. Worrying yet extraordinary!

Choosing to stay anonymous, the couple, met in 2010 and began experimenting with swinging last year. The man, referred to as G, and the woman, known as J, from Braintree in Essex, said their sex lives were fairly conventional until they looked into using swinging clubs in their area.  But despite being open to a more alternative sex le and not actually married themselves, J admitted. It can ruin your marriage, reports Essex Live .  Speaking about how they discovered their shared interest, G, who was previously addicted to sex, said: Before we met, I was sex hungry. I was very adventurous, I had done threesomes and foursomes. Some people just wanted to come to my flat and get on with it, but it\u0027s all very well having them round but once they leave, you\u0027re on your own.  J, the less adventurous of the two, admitted to only having slept with a girl before they met.  G and J first met in Colchester  town centre in 2010, and for the first few years of their relationship their sex le was normal.  In 2014, they began to look into the practice of swinging, but it wasn\u0027t until last year that they visited their first swinging club. Swinging comes in many dferent forms, and it is not limited to just heterosexual couples. Whether you are gay, straight, or bisexual, single or have been happily married for 20-odd years, anyone can be a \u0027swinger\u0027. In its most common form, the practice involves couples doing what\u0027s called a \u0027full swap\u0027, where two couples will swap partners and engage in full sexual intercourse. G and J first looked into swinging after one of G\u0027s work colleagues would constantly talk about the app \u0027Fab Swingers\u0027.  The 48-year-old said:  I used to take it with a pinch of salt but then I downloaded the app and started looking into it. There were a lot of fake people on there, old men pretending to be couples or young attractive women in the hope they would get some action. People go on it to experience something new, and the minority of fakes ruin it for others. The first club G and J attended was Mingles in Colchester in 2017, a private members club for over 25s, advertised as somewhere to relax, have fun and play in a beautul, sexy environment. J, who is 41, added: I initially thought \u0027no that\u0027s disgusting, that\u0027s not for me\u0027. I did feel nervous at the time, when we got there there was a man stood outside the club with a placard saying \u0027swingers are scum\u0027, he even called me scum as we walked in.

Nigel Hurst, who survived kidney cancer despite being given 12 months to live 15 years ago, tragically took his own le after one missed council tax bill grew to \u0026pound1,500 and then spiralled out of control. He wrote a suicide note to his children hours before bailfs were due to evict him and repossess his house, which he had been living in without heating or water as he could not afford it. And he posted on Facebook: Goodnight sweet world. Daughter Jessica Hurst had been scrolling through her feed during a break from opera rehearsal when she saw the message from father Nigel and paused. She thought it was odd and commented Have you been hacked? Lol and went back to practise. However, hours later when she checked her phone again she saw missed calls from her mother and grandmother. She rang her mum back, who told her: Your dad\u0027s gone.  Jessica, 25, collapsed onto the floor. Her 56-year-old father, who lived in Lindale, Cumbria, had killed himself as could no longer go on. He had left notes in the house, including one at the bottom of the stairs for the bailfs telling them which room he was in. Nigel also left letters for daughters Jessica and Sally, 20. They had no idea of the extent of his money troubles as he had hidden it from them. Jessica bravely shared the note in a plea for more humanity from debt collectors. “It breaks my heart to write this. I love you with all my heart, wrote Nigel, who loved the community he lived in and would organise events such as bonfires and barbecues. I have been so unhappy in my personal le for so long, I cannot go on. Now I am about to lose my house as well as my self respect, I have decided to go.” He added: “Do not grieve for me for long. Passing for me will be a huge relief. I love you both and will always be with you.” Now Jessica is speaking out to highlight her dad\u0027s tragic case as she also wants to help others. She said: No young person should be left without their father because of a few thousand pounds of debt.  Recalling the moment she visited her father\u0027s house following his death in October, Jessica was told by a bailf You\u0027ll be shocked, reports the BBC . Inside she found bankruptcy letters, court letters and other notices on table tops, kitchen surfaces and stuffed in plastic Co-op bags. She told the BBC: Until he died I hadn\u0027t realised my father had been in debt, let alone declared bankrupt. Three days earlier he had dropped me off in Glasgow and helped me move into a flat, ready to start the second year of my master\u0027s degree. He had stayed with me all day, helping me to unpack, and called me three times on his journey back home. It was the last time I saw him. She later found out that Nigel, who acted as an agony aunt to pals, had been living without water or heating as he could not afford it. Nigel\u0027s money problems began in 2008. It started off with \u0026pound1,500 debt owed for council tax to South Lakeland District Council. Over time it spiralled to \u0026pound72,000 due to interest, agent fees and legal costs. In total he owed more than \u0026pound9,300 to the council. He was also declared bankrupt. The rugby fan never disclosed his money problems to his daughters as he was a private man, and Jessica believes her father would have seen asking for help as being a failure.  A coroner in March ruled Nigel\u0027s death on October 4 was suicide. Jessica said: “This debt pushed my father in to taking his own le. It is utterly disgusting and inhumane. The amount of pressure that had put on him was unbearable. No human being was going to withstand that as well as having cancer. It is just not fair.” She added to the BBC: I understand that my dad didn\u0027t reply to the council\u0027s letters and that must have been frustrating. But  a client has been a good citizen, paid his council tax all his le and then suddenly stops, there must be something wrong. I believe that in those circumstances the council should try to reach out to that person. Jessica believes her father was failed by the council and thinks it should have done more to help him, rather than just continue to send letters. She says the first person to turn up to his house and talk about the money he owed was a bailf. The council says it did not have a telephone number for Nigel to talk to him. The debt has since been reduced, but student Jessica and her unemployed sister do not have the money to pay it and know their family home will be sold.

While Kate wasn\u0027t a bridesmaid, many believe she had an unofficial role on the special day - and they believe it was her outfit which gave it away. She wore her stunning blue Catherine Walker dress and matching coat, which she first donned during her tour of Germany in 2017, with a matching floral headband.  But it was the colour which caught people\u0027s attention, as it was almost identical to people in the wedding party. The groomsmen wore blue waistcoats and the page boys were in adorable blue trousers, which are bespoke from London-based Amaia Kids.  This could be a sign she was an unofficial maid-of-honour for Sophie, reports Hello! .

Laura, 34, was sentenced to three years in prison for carrying 290 tramadol tablets into the north African country while on holiday in October 2017.  She was arrested and charged despite her pleas that the painkillers were for husband Omar’s bad back, reports Hull Live .  Her latest bid for freedom was rejected by judges in Egypt. According to the BBC, the family have said the devastating blow has only strengthened their resolve to keep up the fight for Laura to be freed. In the statement, the family said: This result, whilst upsetting, only strengthens our resolve to keep fighting for Laura. She fights every day to survive and we won\u0027t give up until she is back home where she belongs.  Ms Plummer was jailed on Boxing Day last year for carrying hundreds of painkillers Tramadol in her suitcase into the African country. She had already been in custody for two months before her sentencing. She had hoped the Egyptian appeal court would accept she had no way of knowing the Tramadol pills were banned. But she was left in tears after judges in Cairo upheld her conviction and three-year prison sentence. Laura\u0027s Egyptian husband, Omar Saad, 34, broke the news to her inside the notorious Al Qanater prison, where she is living in a cell with 20 other women in 34C heat. In a handwritten letter given to The Sun, Laura said: I was sure they would see sense. This whole situation is just ridiculous. I just want to come home. She also hit out at the UK Foreign Office, who she says refuses to intervene on her behalf. She said: How can they leave me in here? Ms Plummer was sentenced to three years in prison for carrying 290 Tramadol tablets into Egypt while on holiday in October 2017. She was arrested and charged despite her pleas that the painkillers were for husband, Omar\u0027s bad back. She said: What don\u0027t these people get? I wonder  I\u0027ve died and this is hell. What did I do so wrong in my le to end up here?  I thought the appeal judges would see sense and realise I couldn\u0027t have known the tablets were banned. It\u0027s just so absurd. Her brother Kirk has recently spoken of the emotional rollercoaster the whole family have been trapped on since she was jailed. In an interview with Viking FM, he said: I wouldn\u0027t wish what me and my family are going through on anybody, nobody. No one wants to see their daughter or sister in prison and  it happened to them then they would realise just how bad it is. But what are we going through is nothing compared to what Laura is going through in prison out there. You sometimes just sit and think and it hits you again that she is still there and as a family we are trying to get on and lead a normal le but it\u0027s hard and you are constantly reminded taht she is still there with 20 other women sat on a cell floor. The last six months have been an emotional rollercoaster and you get ups and downs.

Clara Malagon, who had been struggling with self doubt and bouts of depression for some time, had been on-duty on the night of the atrocity. She witnessed first-hand horric injuries sustained by the young victims, but the 22-year-old successfully underwent counselling and had a detailed debrief about the bombing with senior doctors afterwards. However, in July last year just seven weeks after the tragedy, Miss Malagon was found hanged at her Manchester city centre apartment.  It is not known why she killed herself. An inquest this week heard Miss Malagon from Twickenham, south west London had completed a degree in nursing at Manchester University and became a critical care nurse at Manchester Royal Infirmary in 2016. She was a keen rower and enjoyed cycling, running and walking and also played the viola and took up ballet and flamenco dancing. But Miss Malagon also suffered bouts of depression and self doubt and had been prescribed the antidepressant Citallipram.  Her father Dr Ignacio Malagon, a consultant anaesthatist at Wythenshawe Hospital wept as he told the Manchester hearing: She was physically quite tough but she was seeing her GP for mental health issues - we talked about it regularly. She was good at taking instructions from her GP and we talked about counselling. Out of the blue she started crying at university, she would come to me but I couldn\u0027t give her professional advice so I advised her to go and talk to someone. She went to counselling organised by university - everything was going well so she came off the medication. But in January last year she started crying again, and she said to me \u0027Dad, I need help.\u0027 After she had been to the GP she was told it was going to be three months before she was going to get any counselling, she said she couldn\u0027t wait for three months and said she wanted to go private.  She found one counsellor but she didn\u0027t like them. We were talking about money and I offered to help her out. I gave her some money to pay for the first few sessions and she found one she did like. She was able to organise the counselling herself. She said she was happy with the lady she found. He added: Clara was a staff nurse but she had done a training course in intensive care. She was on duty in May last year during the Arena attack. It was traumatic for her and I rang her, I was in hospital too, and I said to her: \u0027Are you OK?\u0027 And she said: \u0027Yeah Dad, it\u0027s really tough, I\u0027ve seen some of the kids didn\u0027t make it.\u0027 We had a long chat and I said to her that I realise this is very traumatic for her and  she was upset then she should tell her seniors, or  she felt unwell she should tell her managers. I just said to her not to worry and that it was going to be fine.  A few days after there was a debriefing provided by the MRI. She rang me afterwards and said there had been 50 people there including her seniors and management. Everyone there told how wonderful the team had worked and she was delighted. We talked on a regular basis, either over a glass of wine or dinner. If she had an issue she would talk about it to me in a professional manner  it was to do with work. I was involved  she wanted to talk about anything. She would tell me about the patients she helped, she never said she felt understaffed or overworked. She shared everything with me. I had a very good relationship with my daughter.  When she felt stressed she would share it and talk with me. In the weeks leading up to her death, there were none such conversations. On the weekend before she was due to come for her dinner. She said she was on the train and she was very busy with things and she had been visiting a friend in London - there was no dference in her at all. Miss Malagon\u0027s flatmate Grace Callaghan who found her friend on her  home from work said: She had said to me she was feeling low and she made an appointment with her doctor to prescribe some more antidepressants. \u0027But that weekend we said we would have to have a curry night as we had not seen each other properly. She was one of the loveliest people I ever knew - on the night before there wasn\u0027t any concern about her. GP Dr Gill Aitken said Miss Malagon had been prescribed Citrallipram but in September 2016 she came off it and finished her nursing degree.  In a statement Dr Aitken said: She came back to me and said she was feeling low and crying, and feeling apathetic. Whilst there was no trigger, I believe this was work related. She was anxious about work, she had her own self doubt and confidence issues and she said she wasn\u0027t sleeping. But she denied any suicidal thoughts. She said she wanted some medication and I suggested a review in two weeks time, which she did. She said she had been back to Spain for a few weeks but she felt upset and felt guilty for not being a happy person to be around at the time. She had contacted a Manchester self help group. I asked  there were any issues at work and she said there had been some complex patients. She said she had no suicidal thoughts. She told me her family were a strong protective factor for her. I told her who to contact  she felt in crisis and said  she needed anything she could make an emergency appointment with the team.  Police examined Miss Malagon\u0027s iPad and laptop but found no evidence she would take her own le - with one message to a friend in a social media chat saying she had a successful counselling session. Recording a conclusion of suicide, Coroner Andrew Bridgman said: Clara had her full professional le ahead of her. Her father has told me that she was a fit and active young woman who had lots of hobbies. But it is clear from the evidence that she had mental health issues from around 2016 which correspond with her final year of her degree. She was on medication for around 6-7 months, to which she came off it and appeared to be fine. However this resurfaces towards mid June 2017 - three to four weeks following the Manchester Arena tragedy when she was on duty. It clearly had some effect on her however I have had a discussion with her father, and there was no specic reference to the trauma of the events of that night. She sought therapy and she did take private counselling, and found this helped her. Clara did intend to take her le but this inquest cannot answer why.

Quick-thinking Charlotte Ellett, 15, knew something was wrong when she ed home from school and found dad, Nick, 46, mumbling nonsense. Nick, who suffers from an unrelated heart condition, lay down after lunch feeling shivery and unwell. His we Aquilla took his temperature, but a faulty thermometer gave her a false low reading.  Charlotte, a St John Ambulance cadet in Northfleet, Kent, came home from school to find her father alarmingly unwell. Charlotte told : “I immediately picked up something was wrong. Mum was panicky, dad was sleeping and mumbling gibberish. When he woke up he asked for water but couldn’t hold the cup to drink. “His nails were blue and his lips were turning blue. “I checked his oxygen levels which were low, his heart rate was high even considering his heart condition, and I could tell his temperature was higher than the thermometer was reading.  “St John Ambulance taught me to rule out any other conditions, like heart attack or stroke. When you look behind the lines and add all the elements together you realise that this could be sepsis. “I told mum, ‘dad needs an ambulance now\u0027. “I had to persuade mum a bit because dad doesn’t like asking for help but she agreed to call an ambulance. “Sepsis had been in the news a lot and I knew it moved fast. You have to spot it quickly. When paramedics arrived Nick\u0027s temperature was more than 40 degrees and he was rushed under blue lights to hospital on May, 3 this year. He was treated for sepsis and a leg infection was later identied as the cause.  Nick said: “It’s astonishing what she did. I’m sure she would have done it for anyone, but she did it for me, her dad. Not everyone would be able to stay calm in a family situation like that I’m very grateful. When Charlotte came home from school that day she picked it up straight away and when the paramedics arrived she instinctively gave them the handover - like she\u0027d do at cadets - telling them my oxygen was down, I had lost strength, my temperature was higher than the thermometer reading. I\u0027m very proud of her. She\u0027s our angel. Her mum Aquilla added: “I definitely think Charlotte saved Nick’s le. By the next morning he may not have been with us  she hadn’t persuaded me to call an ambulance.” Charlotte, from Gravesend, plans to pursue a career in medicine, as a neurological consultant or a paramedic.  She was presented with the Guy Evans Young Hero Award at this year\u0027s St John Ambulance Everyday Heroes Awards. The award is presented in honour of Guy Evans, who sadly died from a heart arrhythmia at 17 years old when basic first aid skills may have helped save his le: The charity’s annual event recognises the outstanding bravery and first aid skills of iniduals and teams of people who stepped forward when it mattered most to help people, support communities, and have a positive impact on health. Charlotte said: “To win this award is amazing - I didn’t expect it at all. “When I saw my dad’s face flash up on screen to show that I had won I started crying. “Saving his le means everything to me, I love him and we’re very close. Sometimes it hits you that  I had not gone to St John’s and they had not trained me there he might not be here today. It’s scary to think about the ‘what s’.  The awards were hosted by celebrity vicar and one half of 80s band The Communards, The Reverend Richard Coles, who said: Tonight’s winners didn’t leave. “Instead, they stepped forward when others needed them most and their actions saved lives. “I have met people this evening who would not have survived without their timely interventions, and I am delighted to see these Everyday Heroes recognised by St John Ambulance for their bravery and dedication.” Other winners included 15-year-old army cadet Courtney Powdrill from Luton who went to the rescue of a young man being attacked by a group of youths with a large kne.  The youths ran away, leaving him bleeding on the ground and – without hesitating – Courtney used her St John Ambulance first aid training to apply pressure to a signicant leg wound and raised his legs to reduce blood loss. Fellow award winner Molly Harris was praised for her quick-thinking when her stepdad went into cardiac arrest. Army cadet Molly from North Devon calmly took control of the situation and performed CPR to keep him alive.  Father and son, Garry and Ellis, were also recognised for their le-saving actions winning the Community Hero award after cutting short their round of golf to run to the aid of a man who collapsed on the course. St John Ambulance’s Chief Executive, Martin-Houghton Brown congratulated the award winners and praised the work of St John Ambulance’s volunteers. “The achievements of our award nominees and winners are extraordinary and I have been overwhelmed by the stories of their everyday heroism in protecting le and health,” he said. “These Everyday Heroes have used their links to St John Ambulance to save lives whether that’s as our dedicated volunteers, through using skills they learned in our first aid training, or by working closely with our charity.

Stephen Ringo weighed 29st at his heaviest after gorging on two Big Macs, two large fries, and two large cokes as well as 20 chicken nuggets every day for lunch, followed by a Domino\u0027s pizza for dinner. But after the collapse of his married it forced the 38-year-old to re-evaluate his health and he knew he had to make a change. Before he lost weight, Stephen, of Johnson City, Tennessee, was so large he struggled to put on his socks, and the extra pounds drove his sex drive “into the ground”.  The 5ft 7in IT expert said his body issues deeply affected his confidence and wore away at his marriage until he got orced in 2016. Stephen then began to curb his fast food addiction and ed to his power-lting roots in October 2016, shedding an incredible 16 stone in just two years. The super slimmer said: “It’s fair to say that my weight ruined my marriage. “It was the single biggest factor. “My relationship with my we deteriorated as my weight crept up. “I was depressed and as that set in intimacy kind of left. My weight drove my sex le into the ground.  “I believe my depression and lack of sex drive ultimately drove my we away from me. “If I had been a better husband I might have been able to pull the marriage back together. “My weight held me back from doing so many things. Getting dressed in the morning was tough. I could hardly put on my socks. “My ex-we and I went on vacation to New York City in 2012 and my weight really took a toll on me. When you’re in New York, there is a lot of walking involved. After a walk in Central Park I had to sit on a bench to catch my breath for a half an hour. I felt like a failure. I never prepared meals and I usually ate fast food, he added.  I would usually go to McDonald’s for lunch and order a Big Mac family meal, which was two Big Macs, two large fries, and two large cokes as well as 20 chicken nuggets. I would drive through the drive through so they might think I was ordering the meal for a family. After I finished I always felt so bad about myself. I hated myself. For dinner I would order Pizza Hut or Domino\u0027s. I was almost as round as I was wide. My pants were 60ins and I was 67ins tall. Stephen said his  to the gym in October 2016 was extremely discouraging as he realised how far he had let his fitness slip.  But the former powerlter hit the gym every day and began practicing intermittent fasting which sees him eat only between 5pm and 9pm each evening. The combination, which Stephen has documented on his YouTube channel, has helped him shed 222lbs and his 60ins waist shrink to 32in. Stephen said: “My first time in the gym I was disgusted with myself. I could literally bench 175lbs which is as much as I could when I was a young teenager. “I don’t know how I had let myself get that far. “Gradually I’ve built myself back up 340lbs. “Now I practice intermittent fasting which means I only eat between 5pm and 9pm. When I get home I break my fast with an apple and for dinner I have ground turkey and a pound of green beans. “I have two cups of air popped popcorn and one low-fat ice cream.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meditation teacher claims hangover cure","story":"NewsMeditation teacher claims hangover cure takes just 11 minutes to work - and starts working instantlyInstagram favourite Rory Kinsella says it can take just a few minutes to feel betterShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills23:01, 25 SEP 2018NewsWoman with a hangover after a party \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man claims to have invented a hangover cure that will get you feeling back to normal in just 11 minutes.

Benny, five, has been learning to skate for a year after his owner, former coach Cheryl Del Sangro, 56, took him along to a practice on a whim. During that first foray on the ice last winter, adorable Benny scooted around on the ice after his owner, gleefully - and skillfully - picking up pucks.  It inspired Cheryl - who had rescued the pup from death row at a shelter when he was just a few months old - to take him under her wing as her newest student .   The animal lover has since taken Benny training once every two weeks at the Las Vegas Ice Center, teaching him an array of tricks including turns, crossovers and bunny hops. \u2028She even made Benny a special pair of ice boots by attaching blades to doggy shoes, which he wears on his front paws while using his back paws for grip.  Incredible videos show the talented pup whizzing masterfully around the ice - and one clip has even racked up 30,000 views on Facebook .  Cheryl, of Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, said: “From day one, I couldn\u0027t believe how anyone could not want this dog. “He was absolutely perfect. We had this bond from the first day. “He\u0027s the happiest dog, and he loves learning new tricks. “Now, you can\u0027t keep him off the ice. He just keeps getting better and better. “You can\u0027t help but smile when you see it.”   She added: “We’ve looked into it and we can’t find any other dogs that can skate.”  Cheryl has been skating since she’s four and was a semi-professional in her twenties, but opted for a career in coaching which she pursued for 20 years. She later gave up the career to run a restaurant with her husband Flory, 68, and daughter Brittany, 35. But last year, Flory began attending physio sessions following hip surgery at a clinic close to the Las Vegas Ice Center. Cheryl decided to pop into the rink for a spin and instantly fell back in love. Shortly afterwards, she decided to take Benny onto the ice with her at the suggestion of a pal - and quickly realized he was a natural. She said: “Last winter I started skating a little bit just for myself to stay in shape.  “A friend of mine said we should make a video of Benny, getting some shots of him on the ice and I said, ‘OK, let\u0027s do it.’ “He followed me around and was running after me on the ice. Maybe because it\u0027s so hot here in Nevada, he enjoyed being out there in the cold. “He was rolling around on his back and everything. He enjoyed it so much. “Our daughter, Brittany, I taught her to skate when she was 17 months old. I thought, well,  I could get little 17 month old to skate, why couldn\u0027t I get him to skate?  “We took some dog boots and old blades and we glued them together. “I had him on a leash first in the rink and I helped him along with his feet. “He knows how to turn now, and do crossovers, and he can do little bunny hops with his front feet. “He\u0027s getting more powerful and soon we’re going to have to get the skates professionally put together.” Though the accomplished pup has only been on ice for a few short months, coach Cheryl has big plans in store. She plans to teach him a routine, get him spinning to music and hopes to secure him a part performing for the Vegas Golden Knights’ NHL team’s as on-ice entertainment. She said: “Our mission is to get a little bit more ice time. Next, I want to teach him a routine, maybe to do a spin with some music. “Every time anybody sees him skate, they just laugh. It\u0027s so unbelievable. “I had somebody offer me money to buy him a couple times since, but I would never, ever sell him.

The rear of the building, on Yeaman Shore, would also be remodelled to create an entrance.Internally, the building would have 102 underground car parking spaces.The ground floor would contain the auditorium, a bar, toilets and ticket office.There would be further bars and balcony spectator seating on the first floor, while the second floor would have a corporate dining area and upper deck seating.Architect Kenny Stephen said: “We were commissioned to do a feasibility study to see how a 5,000 to 6,000-capacity venue could be realised.”Mr Stephen said redeveloping the Mecca Bingo building would be cheaper than building a new concert hall from the ground up.He said: “It makes more sense than building from scratch.“Bingo seems to be in decline, with more people playing online,

goods today at home to Hibs  they are to finally get some Premiership points on the board, according to midfield man Paul McGowan.In his usual no-nonsense fashion, McGowan admits the Dark Blues “haven’t been good enough” this season.That’s left them rooted to the foot of the table with no points to their name.The 30-year-old, though, is adamant Dundee have the ability to get themselves out of the trouble they find themselves in.He said: “A bit of luck is just missing for us right now but we need to make our own luck.“We need to start finishing the chances we are creating and we’re not keeping clean sheets.“That doesn’t bode well for trying to get the three points but we need to stick together, start from a clean sheet and then, hopefully, finish off a chance.“Listen, I could sit here and go through all sorts of stuff but it’s time to man up now and be counted.“It will be hard out there, the crowd will be on us a wee bit and rightly so with the way we have started but we need to overcome that and, hopefully, get them onside by putting in a performance.“We need to give them something to shout about because they haven’t had that.”And McGowan says he has no problem with having to deal with a bit of stick from the stands.“The fans have paid money so they’re entitled to have a moan because we’ve not been playing that well,” he added.“We accept that, we’re grown men and  you can’t take criticism then you shouldn’t be in this game.”After a 4-0 tanking at Ibrox last week where the Dark Blues were blown away in the early stages, trailing 2-0 within 15 minutes, McGowan has urged his team-mates to be more streetwise going forward.“You’ve got to weather that first 10, 15 minutes or so and we didn’t.“We gted them two goals and you can’t do that at Ibrox – you can’t do that against any team in this league.“We need to be more streetwise with how the game is going,  we’re under it a bit, just sit in and soak up the pressure until the game settles down a bit. We need to learn that.“Inidual mistakes are costing us and we’re getting punished for them all.“It’s amazing how quickly football can change. At the start of the season we had the chance to go 2-1 up at St Mirren but missed the penalty and then we conceded a freak goal.“Things like that can just turn and luck starts going against you but, listen, we haven’t been good enough.“I’m not going to make excuses or any rubbish like that – we haven’t been good enough and that’s down to the players.“We need to stand up and be counted and start showing how good a football team we are. We need to produce, starting today.“I believe in every one of us that we are good enough to get out of the situation we’re in.“It’s only five games into the season, a couple of wins gets us right up there.“I know we are a good footballing side, it’s the other side we need, being hard to beat and getting clean sheets.”The Dens men come up against a formidable attacking outfit when Neil Lennon’s Hibs come to town – McGowan, though, is certain Dundee can cause some problems of their own.He added: “Hibs are good going forward but they can be got at at the back. They are expansive, have a go, that’s the way Lenny like’s it but he’ll have them well-drilled and well up for it.“It’ll be a big ask for us to get the three points but I’m pretty sure we can.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united boss csaba pleased to have more options for falkirk clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United manager Csaba Laszlo admits he is relieved to, finally, have close to a full squad to choose from.Csaba will have more at his disposal for the clash at Championship bottom side Falkirk today and could hand starts to key men Fraser Fyvie and Billy King.Both are rated touch and go while Sam Stanton, Nicky Clark and Stewart Murdoch are working their way back to full training.Csaba said: “We have spoken with Fraser and he still hasn’t decided but he is not far enough along psychologically but I think, definitely, he will be part of the squad.“We are looking to protect the player in the long term, not just one game.“It will be a decision between him and me.

I am not a player made for playing without any pressure because then I wouldn’t be playing well.“I need pressure to thrive and it’s a big club – it should be in the Premiership.“It’s about how we deal with the pressure and Dundee United is probably the team with the most pressure on it in this league.“You feel like the fans definitely want to get out of the Championship. I want to get out of the Championship as well.“I’m not coming here to play my two seasons on my contract in the Championship.“It’s going to be a tough game and, in this league, every game is tough.

Everybody can beat each other.”After disappointing draws against Alloa and Morton in recent weeks, Frans knows there can be no more excuses.He has captained the side in the absence of the likes of Fraser Fyvie and Stewart Murdoch and feels they are now more equipped, with their ‘leaders’ coming back to the squad, to go on a winning run.“If you look at the way we played last weekend, we had 11 players starting who weren’t here last year but still we produce some good stuff,” he added.“We need to be more efficient. We missed a few chances but also we concede every game.“I do think we defend well but somehow we concede a penalty and the week before it was a free-kick against Alloa.“It is not because of bad defending, just small things, and we need to get better at them.“I think you see every week we are improving but, OK, there comes a time you need to put it in results and start to go on a run.“You see Fraser Fyvie coming back, Billy King, Sam Stanton is still injured, Murdoch is out.“These are players who would walk into a lot of Championship teams and be the leaders.“There are positive things to look forward to.”United will go toe-to-toe with pointless bottom side Falkirk today on an articial surface.However, Frans says they will not be using that or the ongoing stormy weather as excuses for another disappointing display.“I don’t like to talk about the pitch because I don’t want to have any excuses. Whatever pitch it is we should play well.“We went to Queen of the South and I think the first half we produced one of the best performances since I’ve been here.“You come up against dferent circumstances and maybe it’s going to be 100mph wind.“Every week it’s something so  you think too much about circumstances you are not focused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"falkirk boss ray mckinnon looks ahead to clash with old club dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon accepts there will be an added dimension to this weekend’s game against old club Dundee United because he is only “human”.However, the Falkirk manager is adamant his sole focus will be on trying to land a first league win of the season for his new team.McKinnon will be facing United for the first time since being sacked by the Tangerines in October last year.He was axed just 10 games into the season with the Tannadice outfit in fourth place and just five points off the top of the Championship.He said: “I’m treating it just as another game but I am human, so I am naturally going to look at all the scenarios.“However, the focus will definitely be just on us and making sure we are set up properly.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/KMil_Penguin_Auct-17.jpg-846x564.jpg ","title":"here is how much each maggies penguin parade statue sold for at the public auction in va dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn incredible £540,000 was raised for Maggie\u0026#8217s at a public auction at the conclusion of the popular Penguin Parade.A packed audience at the V\u0026ampA gasped in delight as the £539,000 total was announced following frantic bidding for the 82 lots on offer.A donation of £1000 from the floor rounded the total figure to the fundraising target of £540,000 \u0026#8211  meaning which is the costs to run Maggie\u0026#8217s Dundee for a year.P-Pick Up The Phone Penguin was the highest-selling figure going for an incredible £11,000.Judy Murray snapped up Andy Murray-themed Don for £10,000, while the Dundee and United penguins went for £5k and £6, respectively.Here is what each penguin sold for:1 Bonnie Dundee £6,5002 R2DunDee2 £5,5003 Mr Sofishticated £4,0004 Blue Planet Penguin £6,0005 Bagpipes \u0026amp Flippers £9,0006 Engullfed £5,0007 Sid the Penguin £9,0008 Charles £10,0009 Gothamatryoshka £5,00010 Don £10,00011 What Lies Beneath £7,00012 4 Seasons in One Day £5,50013 Heat Reactive Hue £4,00014 I Choose Dundee £7,00015 Dundee Star’s Penguin £6,00016 Absent Penguin £5,00017 Pinguis Anatomica £4,50018 Punky Penguin! £7,00019 Dundee United FC Penguin £6,00020 Sunrise £7,00021 Pen Broon £5,50022 Emperor’s Voyage of Discovery £8,00023 Dazzle Penguin £5,50024 Peter Panguin £7,00025 Pluguin £6,00026 The Store Hus Pingvin £3,50027 Penguinstein £6,00028 Journalism £10,00029 Old Tom Morris £7,00030 Penguin Street £6,00031 WellBEEing £7,00032 Capguin Scott £5,50033 Pop and Pip £9,00034 “PJ” The Poetry Penguin £6,00035 I Believe I Can Fly £10,00036 Fish Food £4,50037 Lord P.

The developer, Dutch property firm Vastint Hospitality, could not be contacted.A y Inverness debate ended on Tuesday with an 8-7 vote to refuse the application despite Ness-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam\u0027 insistence that the vision was that of \"a grand building, that you\u0026rsquod expect to see in a serious city centre\".Inverness Central ward party colleague Richard Laird, however, successfully argued that it \"failed to make a positive contribution to the city\u0027 architecture,\" and therefore contravened the local plan.He described the design as \"absolutely bogging\" and \"exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to tear down in the middle of Inverness\".He and several committee colleagues were also concerned about the potential impact of future traffic movement in Waterloo Place and Glebe Street as a result of the proposed development.There was general support for a hotel to be built at the location but Cllr Laird said the drawing board proposition \"looks exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to teardown in the middle of Inverness\" \u0026ndash a reference to the council\u0027 recent approval for bulldozing and replacing the \u0026lsquo60s-built Bridge Street \"blots on the landscape\".Committee colleague Bill Lobban considered the hotel design \"hideous\".He said: \"It\u0027 the most visible site in the whole of Inverness.

The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Wednesday 26 Sep 2018 2:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117654.jpg","title":"Pensioner pleads for help with poorly cat","story":"\u0026nbspAn Inverness pensioner is appealing for help with her cat\u0027 medical treatment after discovering that her monthly pet plan does not cover the cost of an X-ray.Marie MacIver\u0027 five-year-old cat Charlie has a painful leg and needs the scan to determine what treatment can be given.However, Mrs MacIver, who relies on disability benefit, is unable to afford the X-ray, which will cost about \u0026pound300.She has now contacted the\u0026nbspmedia in a plea for kind-hearted Invernessians to come forward.\"There is no way I can afford to pay for the X-ray,\" she said.\"Since it\u0027 very dficult for me to get out, I have already had to pay for the vet to come to the house and give Charlie a medical, as well as a bottle of anti-inflammatories which cost \u0026pound29 and did nothing.\"I already pay \u0026pound10 a month for a pet plan but it doesn\u0026rsquot seem to cover anything.\"I have tried everywhere to get help with the vet\u0027 bills \u0026ndash the PDSA, RSPCA and Cats Protection, but I haven\u0026rsquot been able to get help from anywhere.\"I hate to see him in pain and I think it\u0027 getting worse.\"It came out of the blue about a month ago, and now it is just not going away.\"Mrs MacIver lives alone with Charlie and says she has a special bond with her little cat.\"He\u0027 my companion and is often the only company I have,\" she said.\"He sleeps on my bed and follows me into the kitchen, and he seems to know not to stray too far from the house because I need him.\"He\u0027 really more like a dog than a cat.\"I try my best to take care of him but things like this are very dficult, and it is such a shame because he is a lovely little cat.\"I need to help Charlie get better.\"\u0026nbspCan you help Mrs MacIver with the cost of Charlie\u0027 X-ray?

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan. However, neither is promoted and both are largely ignored.\u0026#8216The only time senior management appear to take any interest in those iniduals and families living with autism is  it they think it is going to cost the authority money.\u0026#8216At senior manager level, Argyll and Bute Council has rejected our knowledge, rebuffed our experiences, frustrated our efforts, sapped our enthusiasm, drained our goodwill and defeated us.\u0026#8217There is good news, however. Operating in Argyll and Bute with the support of Scottish Autism, the Get Set 4 Autism project provides online resources for professionals dealing with autism.Parents of recently diagnosed children also have access to an autism advisor and the Right Click online programme, helping to provide clear, timely and sensible information and support.Alison continued: \u0026#8216Autism Argyll has raised awareness, improved knowledge and understanding, and forged partnerships with iniduals and organisations such as Scottish Autism. We should be proud of our achievements.\u0026#8217Responding to the criticism, an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We are saddened that Autism Argyll has been dissolved and we thank the organisation for its work down the years to educate the wider community on autism and to support people living with the condition.\u0026#8216We are working with our partners, including Cornerstone and Scottish Autism, on the development of residential resources in Garelochhead and Helensburgh, and also to improve services for people with autism across Argyll and Bute by way of introducing and implementing the Autism Toolbox.\u0026#8216Additionally, we have engaged with Autism Network Scotland for their assistance in further implementing our autism strategy, and these meetings will continue.\u0026#8217Responsibility for autism support also falls under the remit of Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership, and a spokesman confirmed that it had advertised for a new autism practitioner.He added: \u0026#8216We have been working closely with our partners to support those iniduals living in Argyll and Bute with autism and we have been exploring how we can build on the current services that are available. \u0026#8216PICS:Back to the beginning \u0026#8211 Autism Argyll is formed in 2000. no_a38AutismArgyll01Committee members past and present gather for the last-ever Autism Argyll AGM. 06_a38AutismArgyll03It was an emotional occasion for founder members Maureen MacIntosh, left, and chairwoman Alison Leask. 06_a38AutismArgyll02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"furnace shop and post office facing closure","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 2:49 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFurnace Village Store and Post Office is set to close at the end of the year unless someone can be found to carry on the business.The shop, with its three-bedroom bungalow behind, has been owned and managed by Mike and Syb Masters for the past 18 years.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

The handicaps are as tricky as juggling with hedgehogs  The novices keep you on your toes while the listed and the Group races have you tearing your hair out with the temptation to rip into the jolly regardless. Mind you, with just two favourites since 1980 winning the big race, perhaps we should be more confident. The Ayr Gold Cup is run over six furlongs and is open to horses aged three years or older with a maximum field size of 25. For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

An early-morning police raid revealed Thomas Caldwell’s disgusting collection. The 35-year-old was caught with 18 Category A movies- showing the most vile type of child abuse. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that Caldwell, of Kyle StreetAyr, immediately admitted that he ‘downloaded some stuff’. And he blurted out to officers “I don’t get a lot of girls”. Caldwell admitted being in possession of the indecent material between March 15 and November 6. And he faced his sentencing last Thursday for his heinous behaviour. Defence solicitor Tony Currie told Sherf John Montgomery: “He did everything to be compliant with the police process. “He’s a man who’s used pornography in the past and he’s unfortunately allowed it to stray on these occasions. “He lost his employment as a direct consequence because of this matter and he’s actually sourced alternative employment.”  The Sherf queried reference made in the reports to one 27-minute long video. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin replied: “That’s the one they’ve chosen to describe in detail.” Steering clear of putting Caldwell behind bars, the Sherf said: “Quite clearly any offence of this gravity well merits a custodial sentence. “But my  is to consider  custody is the only option. “And in your case, involving mitigating and aggravating factors in respect of your offence -I’ve come to the conclusion that the mitigating outweighs the aggravating, and therefore conclude that you could be dealt with by way of a community payback order. “You will be supervised in the community for three years and it will be a requirement that you will be part of the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. “You do not approach or speak to a child under the age of 16 unless approved from your supporting officer.” Caldwell was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, and must not access the internet via computer or mobile phone. He has been placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register.

McCall admitted: “People are giving me credit for some kind of masterful team talk. “But the reality is our fans were dferent class and played a huge part in getting us back into that game. “At times it felt like the Somerset Road End was pulling the ball into the net. “That’s what makes this such a dficult place for opposition teams to come and we need to make the most of it. “I honestly don’t think our fans realise just how important they are to the team. “Saturday was proof of the key part they can play so let’s hope there’s a lot more to come.” United boast a 100 per cent record on home turf this season and McCall is determined that Somerset will become a fortress again. He said: “You look at the league and would maybe say Ross County have that class edge because of the money they’ve spent. “They have a Premier League squad. “But as for everyone else...there’s no reason why we can’t hold our own.  “Nobody is going to get an easy game at our place and we’re proving we can live with the other sides in this ision. “Had we kept 11 men on the park at Inverness we’d have won there and would be sitting top of the league right now. “So we know  we play at our best we’re a match for anyone.” Ayr will head for old rivals Alloa tomorrow knowing they have a chance to hit top spot should results go their way. Jamie Adams will be rested from the articial surface while Daniel Harvie completes his two match suspension.

Last October, the Post reported how devastated cancer patients would have to travel up to 100 miles for le-saving chemotherapy as the axe falls on the treatment at Ayr Hospital. And it could take them three hours to travel from the Carrick area like the village of Ballantrae to Crosshouse in Kilmarnock as hospital chiefs push ahead with plans to centralise services. A campaigner attended a meeting of Cumnock Community Council to get their support for the campaign. He said: “I was asked to get involved in a steering group in January to fight this. “I don’t think we can’t facilitate the amount of patients in Kilmarnock “We want to keep two open. “It is consultation period just now but we think that they are going to shut the one in Ayr. “We will be looking to host roadshows to the public. “In this area, cancer had affected a lot of the population. “Very few people in this area know about the proposals. “They want to take everything down to Crosshouse.” Cumnock Community Council agreed to support the campaign. One community councillor said: “I think we need to fight this. “We also need to think of people who live in the likes of Damellington and Patna.” And the campaigner said: “We will fight to keep it open. We want the support of community councils, MSPs and councillors to keep the facility in Ayr open.” A community councillor said: “We should write to our MP andMSPs. They should listen to us and we should write to them and ask them to come here. “We should fight to keep two of them open. We should be ploughing money into the two of them. We should be fighting for two of them.” A NHS Ayrshire and Arran spokeswoman said the future arrangements for Chemotherapy Services in Ayrshire and Arran remain under review. She added: “An important aspect of reviewing the service is to ensure that we can continue to deliver increasingly complex chemotherapy treatments to the highest standards possible, taking account of all relevant clinical evidence.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"new ayrshire nursery gets thumbs","story":"NewsNew Ayrshire nursery gets the thumbs upHuge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston13:00, 24 SEP 2018NewsHeads of Ayr farm park nursery design \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new nursery is to be built surrounded by farmyard animals and cute critters. Huge public support helped win permission for the building within the Heads of Ayr Farm Park. And up to 20 jobs will be created. In a recent Ayrshire Post article celebrating 25 years of the farm park bosses Craig and Edna Rankin were excited about gaining approval for the nursery. They had suffered a blow as planning officials knocked it back in March on seven dferent policy points. But the couple’s architect Chris Stewart of Casa design in Ayr revealed: “Planning permission has now been granted for a new nursery school for up to 60 children. “It was approved on appeal on by the councillors on the Local Review Body.” Naturally the new nursery will have an outdoor theme. Edna said: “There is demand to get children back to nature and get outdoors. “There are so many new houses at Fisherton and Doonfoot and the area needs something. “Our own staff here cannot even find places to send their children.” Highly unusually, the plan had won universal support from the public with not one objection lodged with South Ayrshire Council. The application had been sent in earlier in 2017 but it was thrown out in December by council planners who were branded “very negative” by the architect. The site is currently a donkey pasture to the left of the farm steading and attractions and will include a new dedicated entrance from the A719 and car parking. The nursery will be built in the agricultural style with plenty of wooden cladding and some roof lights to mock a barn. The park attracts 180,000 people a year and has 90 staff. Director Greg Rankin said: “We were delighted to have planning for the Nursery granted by the Councils Local Review Board and I would like to thank them. “They were able to see the clear benefits that this project will bring to the area both for the local economy and local families . As well as all of the advantages to having a Nursery on site at Heads of Ayr Farm Park providing kids with the chance to learn and play in a safe outdoor environment. “Work on the Nursery starts shortly and we hope to have construction completed by Autumn next year. We are very excited to get started on its development and have been encouraged by lots of support from Locals and regular visitors of the Farm Park.” Casa Design architect Chris added: “It has taken two years to get to this stage, with ious consultations with the Planning Department and the Ayrshire Roads Alliance. The owners of the Farm Park have extensively researched this type of rural nursery, tied in with farm parks elsewhere in the UK and are very excited about the project. “It was very disappointing that the Planning Department decided to refuse the application in March this year on seven points which they construed as being contrary to the South Ayrshire Local Development Plan and Scottish Planning Policy. “We have found the Planning Department to be very negative with this application from the start. However, we are delighted that after an appeal, the councillors at the Local Review Body hearing this week saw the bigger picture and overturned their planners decision to refuse the application.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"pro wrestling elite stage stacked","story":"NewsPro Wrestling Elite to stage stacked card in Ayr as Kenny Williams defends Heavyweight TitleThe thrills and spills of PWE are ing to Ayr Town Hall tomorrow night with a packed card.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet15:16, 21 SEP 2018NewsPro Wrestling Elite champion Kenny Williams\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat tomorrow as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

Two more goals from Lawrence Shankland helped the Honest Men to victory at Alloa, putting them in prime shape for Wednesday\u0027s Betfred Cup trip to Ibrox. So what did we learn from this afternoon\u0027s display?   1. Shank You Very Much   Ayr fans are running out of superlatives for their star man and he delivered once again here. Lawrence Shankland arrived at Somerset Park 12 months ago with a reputation of unfulfilled talent - but it\u0027s safe to say he has long since put that record straight. Shankland is much more than a penalty box striker and he proved it again here with an all action display, leading from the front. His first goal - a clinical finish - underlined the class dference between these sides and Ayr rarely looked back. Most pleasing for United fans was the sight of Shankland berating teammates for a couple of loose passes as the clock ticked down in its final seconds. His desire and drive to raise standards is proving an example to all and with Shankland in their ranks, the sky could be the limit for Ayr.   2. Liam\u0027s A Touch Of Class   He was talked up as a quality signing and Liam Smith is proving the real deal. The Scotland under-21 full back has been deployed on the left during Daniel Harvie\u0027s suspension and, even though not his natural position, has looked a standout. Once again he offered Ayr real thrust here and was involved in most of their positive play. Boss Ian McCall has said he expects Smith to slot in at right back in the long term, but with such competition for places it is a nice problem to have.    3. Could Ayr Really Stun Rangers?   This was a workmanlike performance from United and they will need to raise their game signicantly to trouble Steven Gerrard\u0027s men on Wednesday night. But Ayr will rarely have the chance to go to Ibrox in better heart and in Shankland they have a genuine match winner who would not look out of place at the top of Scotland\u0027s Premiership. If they can hold their nerve and service the 15-goal striker, they may just cause a shock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterRangers NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Rangers newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotland U21s football teamAyr United FCAlloa Athletic FCRangers FC"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon pensioners 900 mile solo","story":"NewsTroon pensioner\u0027s 900-mile solo effort for charityGeorge Dunlop, from Troon, peddled across the country to raise money for Ayrshire Cancer Support, who offered him care and help 28 years ago when he had cancer.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie12:46, 25 SEP 2018Updated12:47, 25 SEP 2018NewsGeorge reaches Land’s End as he crosses the finish line \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pensioner with an articial knee has cycled almost 900 miles in the name of charity.

Cancer survivor George said: “I had never forgotten the help Ayrshire Cancer Support gave me getting to hospital, and I wanted to  the favour. “The cycle was hard going but I had something in my system that refused to give in. “I did it all on my own, without back-up, and it was a tremendous. “I cycled on canals and old railway lines and, to make up time, sometimes on busy roads.” George lived in Fenwick until 2015 and, following the passing of his we, moved to Troon.  Having been diagnosed with cancer in 1990 and survived the illness, he was motivated to complete the series of climbing all of Scotland’s 282 Munros. When given the all-clear, he had taken up cycling to regain full fitness and continues to cover many miles on two wheels each week. Laura Brown, income and marketing manager for Ayrshire Cancer Support, said: “Despite not liking to ask anyone for money, George collected \u0026pound300, including \u0026pound130 on the road during his arduous cycle the  of the UK. “I’m sure when people know that he has undertaken this huge cycle in aid of Ayrshire Cancer Support, they will be only too delighted to dig deep and show their support. “We are grateful for the support of all fundraisers, whose generosity is crucial to the services we provide for those affected by cancer. “George pulled out all the stops to benefit Ayrshire Cancer Support and it is thanks to him that we can continue supporting families all across Ayrshire affected by cancer.” People can donate to George’s appeal by sending cheques or donating directly to Ayrshire Cancer Support at 22 Wellington Square, Ayr.

And Crane, 36, who runs Prestwick\u0027s Bar Central, is expecting another big performance. He said: Everyone is tipping the Americans but I’m not sure why they’re favourites. The Europeans know this course well and being accurate off the tee will be vital. Do the Americans have a formidable looking team? Sure. But we also have plenty of guys at the top of their game and it\u0027s going to be an incredible contest.  The appearance marks Crane\u0027s second Ryder Cup, following his debut in 2016 at Hazeltine carrying the bag of Chris Wood. Meanwhile, Barassie greenkeeper Kerr Rowan is among an army of 180 course staff working at Le Golf National. The 39-year-old, now a course manager in Gothenburg, Sweden, said: “It’s a huge honour. “Any golf fan would give their right arm to be involved in what is the pinnacle of our sport. “The rough is long and will undoubtedly favour the Europeans. “But you look at the line-up coming across from America and have to say they are worthy favourites.” Kerr, who grew up playing Royal Troon, has been drafted in by friend, Alejandro Reyes, who is course manager at the Ryder Cup venue. Kerr said: “This will be the second Ryder Cup I’ve worked at and nothing compares to the event. “I’m on holes two, three, 13 and 14 and some of the stuff they’ve done with the course is incredible. “It’s been totally stripped back and rebuilt just for this week.” The event kicks off on Friday and is live on Sky Sports from 6.30am.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnRyder CupTroonPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"amazon-adventurer-pip-takes-the-path-for-galashiels","story":"PIP Stewart likes a challenge.\nShe\u0026rsquos cycled 10,000 miles from Kuala Lumpur to London in time to start a new job, pedalled and paddled the distance between Brazil and Peru, and most recently kayaked the entire  of the Essequibo River, the largest in Guyana and third-longest in South America.\nBut, for Pip, these adventures are not just about pushing physical limits, they are opportunities to raise awareness of environmental and human issues that exist in the area.\nAnd this is her ambition as she speaks as part of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society\u0027s Inspiring People talks programme in Galashiels next Tuesday .\nIn her talk, entitled Human Reflections in the Amazon, Pip will share stories and insights from her travels in the region, with a focus on her recent 1,000 km kayak down the Essequibo River in Guyana and the people she met along the way.\nLargely unheard of in the UK, the Essequibo is almost entirely untouched by humans.\nAs such, it has a rich flora and fauna playing home to more than 300 unique species of fish.\nAnd, prior to Pip\u0026rsquos expedition, a signicant portion of the upper river had never been paddled before, making it one of the last great exploratory wonders of the world with potential for a genuine world record.\nStarting in the interior of the country, at the source of the river, the all-female team consisting of Pip, Laura Bingham and Ness Knight were soon required to traverse the imposing Acari Mountains and navigate through remote Wai Wai Lands, the home of the intriguing Wai Wai People, a Carib-speaking Amerindian population who, in Guyana, number just 1,000.\nFollowing this, Pip and the team moved downstream through some of the most fascinating and untouched rainforests in the world, roaring rapids and contentious gold-mining areas. After two months of challenge, however, the women finally reached their destination on the coast: the mouth of the Essequibo as it spills into the Atlantic Ocean just north of Georgetown.

landed in Kintyre.The \u0026#8216Air Ace of Argyll \u0026#8211 Airships in the Great War and the Story of Major J G Struthers\u0026#8217 exhibition in Campbeltown Library features a trove of items belonging to the late Major Jim Struthers, formerly of Ardmaddy Estate, near Oban.The items, including a dummy shell, gas goggles, badges and medals, a unorm and original airship banners and propellers, were collated, over the course of a year, by Eleanor McKay, bibliographic and local studies librarian at Live Argyll, after a conversation with Major Struthers\u0026#8217 son Charles.\u0026#8216He said he had \u0026#8216one or two things\u0026#8217 belonging to his late father,\u0026#8217 Eleanor explained. \u0026#8216It turned out to be eight boxes full of artefacts that we\u0026#8217re still going through now.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s one of the best collections from the First World War that we have seen.\u0026#8217There are parts of shot-down airships, a parachute, fragments of a radiator from a zeppelin and much more.Accompanying the artefacts, are photographs, many taken by Major Struthers himself, documenting his personal le and military career, as well as the history of airships.Major Struthers, who was mentioned in dispatches, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, with two bars later added, for his missions with the Royal Naval Air Service, which amalgamated with the British Army\u0026#8217s Royal Flying Core to become the Royal Air Force in 1918.Major Struthers was recognised for flying more hours than any other airship pilot during the war.Aged 52 by the time the Second World War broke out, Major Struthers was too old to serve but he was in the Royal Observer Corps, his patch stretching from Sutherland to Machrihanish.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s local to Oban but it\u0026#8217s an Argyll story,\u0026#8217 said Eleanor. \u0026#8216Major Struthers was actually based in Cornwall during the war.\u0026#8217Diana Manning, from Drumlemble but originally from Cornwall, attended the exhibition\u0026#8217s Campbeltown opening to find out more about the Cornish history, and found it \u0026#8216fascinating\u0026#8217.During her opening speech, Eleanor said: \u0026#8216I think this is an area of World War One that people don\u0026#8217t really think about.\u0026#8216They think about later aircraft, especially in World War Two, but I don\u0026#8217t think they know the role they had in World War One.\u0026#8217Councillor Donald Kelly, who attended the opening, said he thought it was essential to engage with local school children: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s important that youngsters today know what went on in the past \u0026#8211 especially involving someone from Argyll.\u0026#8217The exhibition, which was launched in Oban in July, will be in Campbeltown until September 29, before moving on to Helensburgh and Dunoon.Councillor John Armour,

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.  A bachelor, he retired to Gford in 2009.  With the help of neighbours and friends he remained at home until April, when his growing frailty led to him being admitted to Midlothian Community Hospital.  Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.  She added: \u0026ldquoDonald handled the Gospel with truth and diligence. His sermons were always topical, he was knowledgeable, articulate and had the ability to keep his hearers engaged.  \u0026ldquoHis ministry was inclusive. He made everyone welcome whether they came regularly or very occasionally, he was always encouraging and approachable.  \u0026ldquoHe procured a beautul organ built by George Holdrich in the late 1800s for a church in Appleby in the Lake District which was due to be scrapped.  \u0026ldquoDonald had it restored and installed in Musselburgh Congregational Church, where it continues to rouse worshippers today.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

Musselburgh resident Andrew Aitken decided to become a volunteer adviser a year and a half ago as, even although he works, he found he had some free time on his hands.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

One of the two reactors at the power station, to the east of the town, is being taken offline.  The programme means hundreds of extra workers will join the 750-strong regular workforce for the maintenance period, known as a \u0026ldquostatutory outage.  Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.

Lewis, of Dalkeith, is the current WTKA Scottish Champion, Sandee Open Intercontinental British Champion, Yokkao Open British Champion and SUSU Fighting Championship Champion. As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.  In Italy, the duo will be competing to become both WTKA Muay Thai and K1 world champions.  Scott Hendry founded the club with friend Charles Cameron in 2014, and currently trains both Lewis and Faith.  \"Definitely, we could have two world champions coming back in November,\" he told the Courier.  \"They could come back with both titles which would be a tremendous achievement.\"  Faith\u0027s exploits are all the more impressive considering she has only been in the sport since May 2017.  \"Faith has been pretty remarkable,\" Scott said. \"She\u0027s had eleven fights in the space of a year.  \"She\u0027s won four titles and she\u0027s ranked number two in the UK.  \"She\u0027s fought the girl who is ranked number one four times and beat her three times.  \"I\u0027ve calculated it and she should move to number one by the end of the year.\"  The club, who train in the Bronx Boxing Gym in Tranent, will hold a fundraiser on Sunday.  He said: \"We\u0027re actually going to be fundraising in the gym.  \"We\u0027re inviting gyms from all over Scotland to come in and spar in the ring and it\u0027ll be \u0026pound3/4 on the door to come in.  \"All proceeds from that will go to the trip. Then we\u0027ve got the JustGiving page as well.\"  Muay Thai is Thailand\u0027s national sport but the WTKA Unied World Championships will be held in Carrara, between Pisa and Genoa, over October and November.  It was recognised as a provisional Olympic sport in 2016 meaning it will receive funding just under \u0026pound20,000 in annual funding from the International Olympic Committee.  The sport can then apply to become part of the Olympic games sports programme after three years.  Speaking about the championship and Olympic approval, Scott said: \"I think its good for the whole of the sport to be honest.  \"That\u0027s a huge thing for the sport, it should open up other avenues for the sport in terms of funding, as well as increase the profile of the sport.\"  There\u0027s definite potential for both Lewis and Faith to become Olympic athletes but Scott knows there is a long road ahead  both want to go pro.  \"Lewis is in a predicament because he\u0027s really good at football as well. He goes across to train in Glasgow every two weeks with the Scotland Youth Development squad.  \"So, there\u0027s a chance Lewis could go into pro football, teams have spoken to him. He\u0027s going to have a choice to make at some point.  \"With Faith, I think  it\u0027s done right she could make a career out of it.  \"There\u0027s avenues she could look at going down, but she\u0027s only 12 so there\u0027s a long way to go just yet.\"  The club has also recently been nominated three times in the Celebrating Sports Awards, held by East Lothian Council.  Put forward by Councillor and Provost John McMillan, they are shortlisted in three categories: Performance/Development Coach of the Year, Club or Community Coach of the Year, and Sports Club of the Year.

Mackintosh was a powerful advocate of Scottish devolution when that was an unpopular view in the Labour Party.

It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful.

Pam, of Kingston, was raising funds for the Teenage Cancer Trust, which provided support to daughter Rebecca, who passed away in December 2015.  The 18-year-old had been diagnosed with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour  and inspired people from across the county and beyond with her positive attitude.  Among Rebecca\u0026rsquos achievements was raising more than \u0026pound70,000 for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland .  Pam completed the Great North Run last year and was again on the starting line on September 9.  She told the Courier each time she took part in an event it was emotional. She said: \u0026ldquoRebecca is the driving force behind everything I do.  \u0026ldquoI feel a great strength she has given me to carry on just by the way she was. I feel I have gained her strength and positivity to do this stuff.  About seven young people aged between 13 and 24 are diagnosed with a form of cancer every day in the UK.  Pam, 51, said: \u0026ldquoI was just wanting to support the good causes that supported Rebecca when she was ill.  Pam completed the course in just over three hours and six minutes, raising more than \u0026pound400 for the charity, and has not ruled out further fundraising challenges.

John Harrison, warden of Aberlady Bay Local Nature Reserve, added: \u0026ldquoMargaret was a truly inspirational person.  \u0026ldquoMore often than not the first to get going on a task and the last to finish, Margaret would commonly work longer than volunteers a fraction of her age.  \u0026ldquoShe was a very well-liked and fun member of the volunteer group, who achieved a great deal for nature conservation over the ten years she volunteered with us.

It hopes to transform the building, which has lain empty for six years, into a workspace offering \u0026ldquoinspiration and support to freelancers, commuters, remote workers, artists, businesses, social enterprises and community groups in and around the town.  The plan is a step closer after being awarded \u0026pound8,640 from the Scottish Land Fund.  Sustaining Dunbar claims the project could add \u0026pound800,000 a year to the local economy.  Osbert Lancaster, development officer, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThe building has been standing empty for some time.  \u0026ldquoUntil we know the full condition of the building and cost of remedial work and refurbishment, we don\u0026rsquot know  the project will be financially viable. This grant will let us engage an architect to assess the building and estimate the costs.  Sustaining Dunbar, formed in 2008, is a community development trust and charity. It aims to bring people together to create practical projects across the Dunbar and East Linton area that improve quality of le, support the local economy, and enhance the natural environment.  Mr Lancaster added: \u0026ldquoIf we can make it happen, it should be a win-win all round.  \u0026ldquoNot only will it be great for the people using the co-working centre, it will bring more people and more trade to High Street and boost the local economy.  \u0026ldquoA study we commissioned suggests it will add between \u0026pound600,000 and \u0026pound800,000 to the area each year. And profits from the operation will be invested in practical support for local community groups and social enterprises.  Jo McNamara, chairwoman of Sustaining Dunbar, felt the funding boost was \u0026ldquoa signicant step towards our vision of developing something really special in Dunbar.  She added: \u0026ldquoWhile creating more workspace is essential for the area, what\u0026rsquos truly exciting is the way co-working spaces like this can bring people together \u0026ndash to share ideas, to collaborate and to build a stronger community.

Mr Wood said: \u0026ldquoIt made mention that he died at Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoWhilst I knew a little bit about golf history and its strong links with Musselburgh during my 15 years, up until 2014, as sub-postmaster there, this was the first mention I\u0026rsquod seen of the Willie Park connection to Levenhall as opposed to Musselburgh and the Old Course.  \u0026ldquoI use the Scotland\u0026rsquos People website run by the National Records of Scotland in my local and family history research so quite quickly found Willie\u0026rsquos death registration in 1903 together with the Park family entry on the 1901 Census: both at Laurel Bank, Levenhall.  \u0026ldquoI knew the house owners as former customers so when I next saw them I mentioned what I\u0026rsquod discovered and expected them to know about it, particularly as Andrew, like me, is a keen golfer.

The 67-year-old from Ardtalnaig, Perth and Kinross, says she knows there will come a time when she won\u0026rsquot recognise their faces or know who they are.  The considerate grandmother is also writing them each a letter before her memory deteriorates.  Although she was diagnosed with the \"horrible\" illness, Olive says she still remains determined to make the most of her le while she\u0027s able.  She said: \"I was born in Scotland and in my family it was always a tradition that once you turned 21 you would receive a key - it\u0027s an old-fashioned thing.  \"I did the same thing for my kids.  \"So because of my personal experience I felt it was a good idea to do the same for my grandkids.  \"But because I have vascular dementia I\u0027ve had to prepare it early. I went to an antic store in Edinburgh to get the keys for them.  \"And I\u0027m going to write letters to all of them too.  \"I really hope they will appreciate this special tradition and that they will also do it with their own children someday.\"  Olive has been married to Ronnie, 74, for 41 years and she still keeps a close bond with her three children - Douglas, 46, Alene, 48, and Christopher, 43.  Her six grandchildren are Andrew, 17, Colin, 12, twins Liam and Connor, eight, Luka, seven, and Isla, four.  When she was first diagnosed with the illness, Olive said she felt her le had suddenly stopped.  She said: \"When I first found out I was fed up and depressed, I didn\u0027t want to talk about it with anyone.  \"I eventually sucked it all up and I thought  I decide to give up then I would have already been defeated.  \"You just never know which part of your brain will go first but I will enjoy today and worry about tomorrow later.\"  When Olive realised she was no longer good at mental arithmetic and struggled to remember words, she took it upon herself to find out  she had dementia - as there is a family history of the condition on the female side.  That was in 2012 when she was 61 and had ed to Scotland to retire after 40 years in Canada.  The gran-of-six was referred for tests and, aged 63, was told she had a 10 per cent memory loss at that stage.  In 2015, following further tests, she was officially diagnosed with vascular dementia.  Recently, Olive, who previously managed a care home, completed a mammoth trek to raise money for pioneering research.  On May 1 Olive started walking the famous Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route through France and northern Spain with her husband, Ronnie, for Alzheimer\u0026rsquos Research UK.  Walking a minimum of 10km each day, the couple took two months to complete the 780km route \u0026ndash a month quicker than planned.  She said: \"I was looking for ideas for something we could do to raise money.  \"There are some things I can\u0026rsquot do, but I watched the film The Way, starring Martin Sheen, where they trek the Comino de Santiago route, and I thought \u0026lsquoI can walk, let\u0026rsquos go for that\u0026rsquo.  \"The trek was very tough, but we got stronger and stronger each day.  \"The hardest point was early on when we both got sick.  \"Because we were focused on walking, we didn\u0026rsquot realise how ill we were. We had to stop and rest for three days.\"  Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia and occurs when blood flow to the brain becomes reduced.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":null,"title":"non-religious-pupils-could-be-excluded-from-nativity-plays","story":"  The attack comes after the Church said such pupils would face wider exclusion from \"charitable fundraising, Nativity plays and feast day celebrations\".  Officials from the Humanist Society Scotland and Secular Scotland said denominational schools could even face legal action  they followed the advice.  Earlier this month First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government intended to incorporate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into Scots Law.  The a move is signicant because the UN\u0027s Children\u0027s Rights Committee recommended the current right of parents in Scotland to opt out of religious observance should be extended to pupils.  Responding to the suggestion a spokesman for the Catholic Church said: \"Current guidance, allowing pupils to express their views on religious observance, allows them to be given an explanation of the advantages of religious education and religious observance, following which many pupils continue to attend.\"  The spokesman said schools would organise \"purposeful work\" for those pupils who still wanted to opt out.  But he added: \"Parents and pupils who wish to opt out on grounds of conscience are advised that, in order not to contradict their wishes, schools will ensure they are not part of any other religious education and religious observance activities such as religiously-motivated charitable fundraising, Nativity play or feast day celebrations. Very few wish to be excluded in this way from the le of the school.\"  The statement provoked an angry backlash from Gordon MacRae, chief executive of the Scottish Humanist Society, who described it as \u0026ldquodisturbing.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis suggests denominational schools coerce or threaten to isolate children and young people from the school community because of their faith or belief.  \"Following such a course of action would put denominational school headteachers in potentially actionable situations and completely distract them from the professional work they do educating pupils and running inclusive school environments.  \"All schools in Scotland, including denominational ones, have a responsibility under law to respect and uphold the independent human right to freedom of religion and belief.\"  Robert Canning, chair of Secular Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe would not agree that children opted out of religious observance, by themselves or their parents, should automatically be excluded from all activities connected with religion, since not all such activities involve worship or prayer.  \"Children acting in Nativity plays are obviously expressing the outlook of the characters and not their own beliefs, and a child might want to be part of a fundraising effort without having the religious motivation that other participants might claim.\"  Professor Paul Braterman, from the Scottish Secular Society, said: \"Parents and pupils should be allowed to decide for themselves regarding matters such as Nativity plays and Feast Day celebrations, on a case-by-case basis.  Meanwhile, teaching unions welcomed the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos intention to incorporate the UN\u0027s convention on children\u0027s rights into Scots Law.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland said the union would support the right of children, at a suitable point in their development, to be able to withdraw from religious assemblies  they wished.  He added: \"We would support children at a suitable point in their development having the right to withdraw  they wish and note that Scottish Government guidance makes it clear that in no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.  \"Under the terms of the Equality Act, schools have a legal duty to prevent discrimination against those who hold particular religious or philosophical beliefs and to actively ensure that they have equal opportunity to participate in the le of the school.  \"To actively exclude children from activities which may be religion-related, but which would not be classied as religious observance, is likely to invite strong legal challenge.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"The existing statutory guidance recognises that when a parent chooses a denominational school ... there is an expectation that they have opted into the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice including activities relating to religious faith and observance.  \"Our guidance also states no pupil should be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawal from religious observance.\"  In Scotland, all young people require parental permission to pull out of religious observance, unlike England and Wales where sixth form pupils \u0026ndash typically aged between 16 and 18 \u0026ndash have the right to opt out.  The law which governs religious observance, originally dating from 1872, has not been updated since 1980 and the latest guidance from the Scottish Government was issued in 2011.  The guidance states: \"Where a parent chooses a denominational school for their child\u0026rsquos education, they choose to opt in to the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice which is imbued with religious faith and religious observance.  \"In denominational schools, it is therefore more dficult to extricate a pupil from all experiences which are influenced by the school\u0026rsquos faith character.  \"Where a pupil is withdrawn from religious observance schools should make suitable arrangements for the pupil to participate in a worthwhile alternative activity. In no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.\""},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-says-any-peoples-vote-should-not-include-option-of-britain-staying-in-eu","story":"  Pro-EU activists\u0027 hopes of the party fully throwing its weight behind a People\u0026rsquos Vote suffered a major setback at Labour\u0027s conference in Liverpool.  More than 100 constituency parties submitted motions demanding a second referendum and thousands of people joined a march calling for a so-called People\u0027s Vote in order to put pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to change course.  But, as expected, after a marathon \u0026ldquocompositing session on Sunday night, the exact wording of the motion to be put to a vote at the party\u0027s conference tomorrow states only that \" we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\".  This is effectively a restatement of the leadership\u0026rsquos position.  However, John McDonnell, a key ally of the party leader, went further this morning by making clear that  there were any second referendum, it should be on whether or not to accept a Brexit deal or conduct fresh negotiations with Brussels rather than seek to reverse the 2016 decision to leave the EU.  The Shadow Chancellor explained: \"We argued for Remain in the past but we lost that vote so we have to respect that. All the polling that we have seen is that the country is still pretty split down the middle.  \u0026ldquoMy big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  it\u0027s slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.\"  He noted how the 2016 poll \"opened up all sorts of xenophobic feelings and a rise of the Right\" and stressed: \"I don\u0027t want to revive Ukip in any way or even the far Right\".  The precise wording of the referendum question would be a matter for Parliament, Mr McDonnell pointed out, telling BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"If we are going to respect the referendum, it[a People\u0027s Vote] will be about the deal.\"  On Good Morning Britain he suggested that a general election would be \"the real People\u0027s Vote\" because it would give the public the chance to change the team carrying out the negotiations, replacing Theresa May with a Labour government.  But he acknowledged the debate at the conference \"may be rumbustious\".  Labour MP David Lammy, a prominent campaigner for a second referendum, was not best pleased, saying it would be \"farcical\" to have a vote without the option of remaining in the EU.  \"A People\u0027s Vote is the only realistic option to save this country from the car crash of Brexit, declared the London MP.  \"No Tory or DUP MP is likely to vote for a general election. Turkeys do not tend to vote for Christmas.\"  He added: \"We\u0027ve now got to turn up the noise until we secure a public vote which gives us the option to remain in the UK.\"  Mr Lammy received support from his Labour colleague and fellow Remainer Chuka Umunna, who called for an \"unequivocal\" commitment to a second referendum with remaining in the EU as an option.  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats said, by ruling out the option of Britain staying in the EU in a second referendum, the Labour leadership was aiding and abetting Theresa May on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove spent two years backing the Tories\u0026rsquo catastrophic Brexit and are even now trying to ignore their own members who want a People\u0026rsquos Vote with the option to remain in the EU.  \u0026ldquoIt beggars belief that McDonnell and Co are spending so much time trying to trick and stitch up their own conference rather than campaigning for an exit from Brexit to protect jobs and services in the UK.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe only choice a \u0026lsquodeal or no deal\u0026rsquo vote gives people is which foot to point the gun at. Liberal Democrats demand better than Brexit and want to give the people the final say on any deal through a People\u0027s Vote where they will have the option to remain in the EU.  Eloise Todd of pro-EU Best for Britain said it would be \"unthinkable\" for a second vote not to include the option of Britain staying in the EU and was \"not what the 90 per cent of Labour members who back a public vote would expect\".  She added: \"Labour must listen to its members on this and the vast majority of its voters. It\u0026rsquos time for a final say with the option to stay.\""},{"url":null,"title":"back-in-the-frame-national-gallery-of-scotland-re-boot-scheme-with-21m-plan-to-open-in-2021","story":"  Now priced at \u0026pound22m, up for the previous estimate of just under \u0026pound17m, the National Galleries of Scotland are to begin a major revamp of the key gallery in the centre of Edinburgh.  The troubled project was put on a \"pause\" last March when it was facing spiralling costs, many posed by the complex site: on a hill, in a major public park, under a listed building and close to a major railway line.  Now the galleries  have unveiled a new conception of the revamp, which will create new galleries for the display of Scottish art, and a complete rehang of the gallery space.  It will open in early 2021.  : When Galleries pressed \u0027pause\u0027 on revamp project  The galleries have long wanted to change the display of Scottish art at the National Gallery, which for many years was shown in a \"cramped and dark\" concrete basement.  Work will begin in October, and the NGS say that the galleries will remain open throughout the redevelopment project.  However, to enable excavation works to the galleries directly beneath, the notable Playfair Steps, at the rear of the National Gallery, will be closed for the duration of the building work.  The Playfair Steps, designed by William Henry Playfair, are an historic steep flight of steps from the Mound to Market Street, and are often busy, especially during the Festival.  The new galleries, with large windows running the  of the new Princes Street Gardens facade, will have a \"broader\" look at Scottish art, and will open in 2021.  : Stop and start history of landmark revamp project  They will feature the art of Allan Ramsay, Gavin Hamilton and Sir David Wilkie, as well as 20th century artists such as Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Stanley Cursiter and the Scottish Colourists S J Peploe and F C B Cadell.  The plan will involve \"extensive new landscaping in the gardens\", as well as a larger shop, and a new cafe.  The galleries say that once open, they will have a \"dedicate family day\" one daya a week, and more volunteers working in the galleries.  The first sign of the revamp will be construction work in October, followed by a new coffee shop at Christmas, and new steps and paths by next spring.  Funds for the revamp are from the National Lottery, worth \u0026pound4.9m, and the Scottish Government, worth \u0026pound5,5, as well as signicant fund raising.  : Director previously hoped for 2020 re-opening  Sir John Leighton, director-general of the National Galleries of Scotland, said: \"This is a hugely exciting time for us, as we see our ambitious plans for the Scottish National Gallery getting underway.  \"We will create the perfect showcase for the nation\u0026rsquos extraordinary collection of Scottish art, giving it room to breathe and showing it off with real pride to the world.  \"This ambitious project will completely transform the experience of our visitors, creating a National Gallery that is even more open, engaging and inviting with new presentations of Scotland\u0026rsquos art in a setting that will be truly world-class.\"  Dr Tricia Allerston, co-director of the Scottish National Gallery Project, said that visitor numbers to the Scottish National Gallery have almost \"doubled in the past ten years but fewer than one in six of them made their way to the cramped, dark spaces which used to house the national collection of Scottish art.\"  She added: \"Soon, visitors will be able easily to discover, appreciate and enjoy our highly signicant collections of Scottish art through a series of innovative displays designed expressly to engage them.  \"Imagine looking at a painting of Sir Walter Scott and then looking out of the windows into Princes Street Gardens, a landscape created during his letime and which is now dominated by the great monument marking his international fame.\"  : Sir John Leighton on national gallery\u0026nbsprevamp plans  The designs for the revamp are by Hoskins Architects.  The main entrance will be to Princes Street Gardens.  Aside from a short period in early 2019, the Mound precinct will remain open, and events such as the Christmas market will go ahead as scheduled.  Lucy Casot, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a hugely exciting time for Scotland\u0026rsquos arts and cultural heritage with the recent openings of Mackintosh at the Willow and the V\u0026ampA Dundee and now the beginning of a wonderful new gallery, none of which would be possible without funds from the National Lottery playing public.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour-divisions-over-second-vote-on-brexit-flare-up","story":"  Yesterday, the party\u0026rsquos rt over a so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote was laid bare after John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, insisted that Remain would not be part of any question put to voters in any second referendum. Later, Sir Keir insisted it would be.  And in his keynote speech the Shadow Brexit Secretary again claimed the possibility of Britain retaining its membership of the EU in future public not only had to remain an option in another referendum but no-one, including Mr McDonnell, was ruling it out.  However, during an at times passionate debate on Brexit, Steve Turner, Assistant General Secretary of Unite the union, told delegates that  the Tories were not brave enough to call a general election, then Labour would \u0026ldquodemand they go back to the people with a vote on the deal.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThat is not in a second referendum, despite what Keir Starmer may have said earlier, it will be a public vote, that\u0026rsquos a vote on the terms of our departure.  Len McCluskey, the union\u0026rsquos leader, has made clear that he believes the 2016 Brexit vote should stand and there should not be a rerun to keep Britain in the EU. He too wants to see a general election to get rid of Theresa May\u0026rsquos Conservative Government.  In his conference address, Sir Keir made clear the party was set to vote against the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Brexit plan when it was put to a Commons vote and that a general election should be triggered  she were unable to win Westminster\u0026rsquos approval.  As he went through the key passage, delegates regularly applauded ious sections and at one point around two-thirds of delegates rose to their feet.  The Shadow Secretary of State argued that  Labour could not secure a general election, then \"we must have other options that must include campaigning for a public vote\".  He went on: \"It is right that Parliament has the first say but,  we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.\"  Sir Keir\u0027s comments departed from the text of his speech and was at odds with Mr McDonnell\u0026rsquos view.  But, earlier, the Shadow Brexit Secretary sought to play down the split, claiming it did not exist and that the Shadow Chancellor\u0026rsquos initial assessment could be put down to having been \"up early\" for his interviews on Monday, just hours after Labour\u0027s policy motion was thrashed out in Sunday night\u0027s marathon meeting.  Explaining Labour\u0027s strategy for the looming Commons showdown on whatever deal Mrs May brought back from Brussels, Sir Keir said there was \"ision, chaos, failure\" under her premiership and \"the Government has no credible plan for Brexit, weeks out from the deadline\".  He told conference: \"The Tory civil war on Europe that has been going on for years now risks our prosperity.  \"The party that once promised that it would fix the roof while the sun was shining is now intent on burning the whole house down, declared Sir Keir.  \"So, I\u0027ve got a message for the Prime Minister:  your party wants to tear itself apart, that\u0027s fine\u0026hellip but you\u0027re not taking our country with you.\"  He noted that it was \"increasingly likely\" that whatever plan Mrs May brought back to the Commons would fail to meet Labour\u0027s tests for a Brexit agreement and  so \"we would vote against her deal\".  Labour would also vote down a \"vague\" deal, a so-called \"blind Brexit\" that did not spell out details of the future relationship.  \"This is not about frustrating the process it is about stopping a destructive Tory Brexit,\" insisted Sir Keir.  He refused to accept that the only option available  Mrs May\u0027s plan were voted down was a no-deal Brexit.  \"No deal would be a catastrophe and no government has the right to plunge our country into chaos because of their own failures,\" declared the Labour frontbencher.  Under the terms of the motion set to be voted on late this afternoon,  Labour could not force an early general election, it would \"support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\".  The possibility of another referendum after 17.4 million voted to leave the EU has led to fears of civil unrest and the rise of far-right politics.  But Sir Keir said that that could be avoided and the party had a responsibility to save the UK from leaving without a deal.  Ahead of his speech, he told BBC Radio 5 Live a no-deal Brexit would \"rupture our trading arrangements and this will cost jobs, I don\u0027t doubt that the pound will begin to drop\".  The Shadow Brexit Secretary explained: \"We won\u0027t have any arrangements for security and counter-terrorism - I worked, when I was director of public prosecutions, on counter-terrorism work across Europe - the idea that we wouldn\u0027t have an arrangement in place for that would horry people,\" he said.  \"And, frankly, this idea that we might have medicines stockpiled for six weeks has spooked people.  \"We don\u0027t want to face that situation and we have got a duty to do something to stop it and that\u0027s why the option of a public vote is important as something that may have to happen when we get to that stage.\"  Acknowledging the sensitivity of the issue, Sir Keir said: \"We have to manage it in a sensible way but we have to accept we are only having this discussion because of the failure of the talks.\"  Labour\u0027s position leaves the PM brutally exposed to a rebellion by restive Tory backbenchers, with fewer than a dozen able to fracture her fragile control of the Commons in the upcoming vote.  The Shadow Brexit Secretary confirmed talks were taking place with potential rebels, telling the BBC: \"If we get to that stage this autumn, most MPs would be prepared to say: \u0027We need to do something to prevent us crashing out of the EU without a deal.\u0026rsquo\"  In response to his conference speech, Eloise Todd for the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said: \"Keir Starmer\u0027s speech has put staying in the EU firmly on the table.  \u0026ldquoAfter an unprecedented grassroots effort mainly from Corbyn\u0026rsquos supporters, Labour look set to back a public vote should an election not happen. The delegates should listen to the standing ovation that accompanied Keir\u0026rsquos words and confirm the motion this afternoon.  Gerard Batten, the UKip leader, said: \u0026ldquoKeir Starmer is another member of the Remainer elite who thinks he knows better than the people. I will remind him that five million Labour voters also voted for Brexit.  \"Labour, Liberal or Tory, it\u0027s clear that  people want Brexit, then they will have to vote for UKIP at the next General Election.\"  Stephen Gethins for the SNP said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time for Labour to stop playing games and finally nail its colours to the mast with a genuine alternative to a Tory extreme Brexit.  \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos shameless \u0026lsquoman without a plan\u0026rsquo political posturing is simply not good enough. It is a total absence of leadership on the biggest issue facing the country and it shows Labour is not fit for opposition let alone government.  The party\u0026rsquos Europe spokesman went on: \u0026ldquoUnbelievably, Labour still appear to back the harmful fundamentals of a Tory hard Brexit dragging Scotland out of the EU against its will and causing huge damage to jobs and the economy by taking the whole of the UK out of the single market and customs union, which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.  The Fe MP added: \u0026ldquoWith just six months to go before the UK crashes out of the EU, it is staggering that Labour have failed to outline a clear alternative to the Tories and continue to pursue a reckless path that they know will destroy jobs, damage businesses, and inflict lasting harm on the incomes and living standards of millions of people\u0026hellip  \u0026ldquoIt is time Labour ditched their support for a Tory hard Brexit and joined the SNP in standing up for the interests of the country.  Brandon Lewis, the Conservative Chairman, said: \u0026ldquoKeir Starmer has confirmed Labour would break their promises and take us back to square one on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoIn the space of one morning, he has refused to rule out delaying Brexit, refused to confirm Labour would end freedom of movement, and opened the door to staying in the EU with a second referendum. Labour\u0026rsquos promises on Brexit aren\u0026rsquot worth the paper they\u0026rsquore written on.  \u0026ldquoLabour can\u0026rsquot deliver the change the British people voted for and it\u0026rsquos only the Conservatives who have a plan to take back control of our laws, borders and money, he added."},{"url":null,"title":"leonard-pledges-land-reform-to-end-dominance-of-feudal-private-landlords","story":"  The Scottish Labour leader in his keynote conference speech also made clear his party in power would give more state aid to Scottish businesses instead of foreign-owned companies.

On land reform, he said Labour had unfinished business and that after abolishing feudalism in the first term of the Scottish Parliament the nation was still living with \u0026ldquofeudal ownership with 432 private landowners owning half of privately-owned land in Scotland.  Describing the earth as a \u0026ldquocommon treasure, he insisted what was needed was land ownership in Scotland for the many and not the few.  A Scottish Labour government would introduce a new Land Reform Act to break up the dominance of private landowners and will look at the possibility of introducing a tax on land value, capping the amount on landowners\u0026rsquo beneficial interest and a residential requirement on absentee landowners.

And so it goes on \u0026hellip and on \u0026hellip until Judgement Day.  The sprawl of referenda facing us makes the map of New York\u0026rsquos subway system seem understandable. Labour members want a second referendum, a People\u0026rsquos Vote, on the Brexit deal, which may, or may not, include a question about staying in the EU. However, Labour won\u0026rsquot allow Scotland to have a second independence referendum. How does that work? A second referendum on the EU is okay, but not a second referendum on independence? That\u0026rsquos a straight-up fail in logic class.  Then we come to the SNP \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a big push for the First Minister to back a second People\u0026rsquos Vote, but she\u0026rsquos not committing. That\u0026rsquos probably because the party is committed to a second Scottish independence referendum \u0026ndash although, when that might be, we don\u0026rsquot know \u0026ndash and some worry a People\u0026rsquos Vote will set the precedent that a future independence referendum can be overturned.  But that doesn\u0026rsquot make sense either. If pro-independence folk push for a second independence referendum, then why shouldn\u0026rsquot Unionists push for a third in the event the No side loses, or push for a People\u0026rsquos Vote on any independence \u0026ldquodeal? If you want a second indyref, then why not back a second EU vote? Why not a third vote on Brexit called by the Brexiters  they lose a People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash why not just keep going until I have grandchildren in middle age? Why not just keep going until we are all driven stark staring mad?  We\u0026rsquore now playing referendum Jenga \u0026ndash piling up phoney choice on phoney choice in a rickety tower that cannot stay stable, and it\u0026rsquos democracy which is at risk of tumbling down.  I spit my curse on referenda not because of sour grapes \u0026ndash my side got beaten in two votes. I support Scottish independence, and I support remaining in Europe. I spit my curse on referenda because I see more of them coming in the future, and  we think we\u0026rsquore ided and unhappy now, wait and see how we feel when we\u0026rsquove been through one or two or three more.  Let\u0026rsquos stick with losers like me for a moment. We got beaten 45-55 over independence and 48-52 over Europe. Look at those margins. In Scotland, 45 per cent of the population were left with their dreams crushed. In the UK, 48 per cent had their world pulled from under them. Should 55 per cent of the population have the right to leave 45 per cent sitting in the corner crying? Should 52 per cent have the power to trash the house of the other 48 per cent?  This is the tyranny of the majority \u0026ndash and I\u0026rsquove long been thinking about what it would have been like  the shoe was on the other foot. I hope I would have felt empathy for a defeated Unionist or a Brexiter. Their political positions are not wicked \u0026ndash both are legitimate, decent opinions to hold \u0026ndash but the binary black and white of referenda puts the boot well and truly into the face of empathy. No-one walks in another person\u0026rsquos shoes when it comes to a referendum, you steal their shoes, tie their laces together and fling them over a telegraph pole in spite.  It may sound crazy given the public mood, it may even sound anti-democratic, for which I ask forgiveness, but perhaps this whole clunking winner-takes-all referenda path we\u0026rsquore on is deeply damaging to democracy. No matter what side of the fence you sit on \u0026ndash pro-independence, pro-Union pro-Europe, anti-Europe \u0026ndash you cannot say that the choices we\u0026rsquove made and the way those choices have been acted upon has been beneficial to the common good. It\u0026rsquos a bitter mess from Caithness to Cornwall.  Would it be better  referenda were settled with a 60-40 win? At least then the utter crushing of the losing side would not be so deadly and isive. If 60 per cent of the population told me I was wrong over independence and Europe, then perhaps it would have been more palatable. When Yes lost I felt as  a dream had evaporated because I was looking to the future \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost what I never had. When the Brexiters won I was bereft as I felt part of my identity had been stolen \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod lost something very tangible. Pull a switcheroo, and imagine that Yes won, or Brexiters lost, and you can see the same unhappiness across the ide: Unionists robbed of identity, anti-European dreams dashed.  But the ghost is out of the bottle. We can\u0026rsquot stop this chain reaction of referendum leading to referendum, nor can we tweak the rules \u0026ndash once we\u0026rsquove started down this path the road must remain level. So, on we will go, vote after vote, a slim minority of people hurt and thrust into the cold, a slim majority gloating in victory \u0026hellip until calls for new votes start again.  This is a Naked Lunch moment \u0026ndash a frozen moment when everyone sees exactly what is on the end of their fork. What I see is that we\u0026rsquove embraced endless ision, that we\u0026rsquore happy to hurt the other side on an existential level, that we cannot empathise with those who hold dfering political views \u0026ndash and that is because we brought in the blind god of referenda to stand in place of the slow grind of discussion. Change happens, it always does, but over these last years we wanted to light a fire under change, to turbo-charge its engine \u0026ndash all we\u0026rsquove really done is blow the bloody doors off the car."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-dont-like-immigration-better-stick-with-the-union","story":"  Take the SNP. The ruling party has long been making noises that Scotland - and an independent Scotland in particular - needs an influx of working-age immigrants to keep its economy afloat, and earlier this year it made the case for Scotland taking control of its own borders regardless of whether it remains part of the UK or not.  The bid has met with a mixed response from the public, with respected pollster Sir John Curtice finding in January that 63 per cent of Scots wanted to keep the same immigration rules as the UK, while a report issued last week by the National Conversation on Immigration suggested that practically the same proportion  now back immigration devolution.  Part of the reason for the flip-flopping is likely to do with the focus on the benefits immigration brings to the economy as a whole, with little attention given to how it impacts on us inidually. Yet you only need to look at the state pension, a benefit every one of us should expect to receive sooner or later, to see the dference greater immigration could make.  It is no secret that Scotland has a rapidly ageing population and in its Sustainable Growth Commission report the SNP noted that while the country\u0026rsquos pensioner population is expected to grow by 28% in the next 25 years the working-age population will grow by just 1%. This matters because, contrary to popular opinion, our tax and national insurance contributions are not being collected in inidual state-pension pots to be paid out on retirement, but rather are being used to fund current pensioners\u0026rsquo monthly payments, just as future generations\u0026rsquo taxes will be used to pay ours. It also matters in the context of the independence debate because in the UK as a whole the pensioner population is expected to grow by 33% and the working-age population by 11%, meaning the need for increased immigration, while still there, is less pressing.  The implication of this is clear: without a marked increase in the working-age population, an independent Scotland would be unable to continue paying the state pension - a benefit we should all be entitled to in some shape or form \u0026ndash without taking drastic, and electorally unpopular, action such as increasing taxes or raising the retirement age.  We all know how popular the former idea is, and the UK Government\u0026rsquos plan to press ahead with the latter has met with signicant opposition north of the Border due to le expectancy in some parts of Scotland being so low. Increasing immigration, and so the tax take, would have the potential to negate the need for doing either.  Of course this is all moot for now, with a Home Office-commissioned report issued last week by the independent Migration Advisory Committee concluding that \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos economic situation is [not] sufficiently dferent from that of the rest of the UK to justy a very dferent migration policy.  There will be some in the yes campaign that say this only strengthens the argument for independence, but the problem is that those shouting loudest for a second referendum appear to be the least likely to embrace an increase in immigration on any scale, let alone the scale an independent Scotland would require in order to thrive.  It should come as no surprise that there exists a scepticism towards incomers when a hard-core of indy supporters so vocally hanker after a country that is ours alone. Indeed, ahead of the 2014 independence referendum St Andrews academic David McCollum led a study that found \u0026ldquoevidence of some  hostility towards migration on the part of the general public in Scotland and a possible link between nationalist leanings and opposition to \u0026lsquoOthers\u0026rsquo. This opposition appears to have crystallised into the backward-looking \u0026lsquothis land is our land-ism\u0026rsquo of the kind of die-hard secessionist who believes that screening Mel Gibson\u0026rsquos Braveheart at a rally will strengthen the indy cause.  Regardless of political stance, as an electorate we are always asked to make binary decisions - him or her, red or blue, in or out, yes or no - when the implications of those decisions are anything but black and white. In the normal course of events backing the wrong horse doesn\u0026rsquot matter too much because another election will always come along to let you change your mind. With referendums, however, the decision is far more binding, meaning voters will have to sacrice some of their beliefs in favour of other, more palatable ones.  While some in the electorate may have independence at the top of their wish list and will do anything to get the chance to vote for it, the truth is that  immigration is not up there with it then even the staunchest of independentistas would be better off sticking with the UK, in all its Brexity glory."},{"url":null,"title":"turning-glasgow-on-to-health-benefits-of-vegetables","story":"  A lack of fruit and vegetables in our diet has been identied as one of the major causes of serious illness, yet Glasgow\u0026rsquos consumption of vegetables in some areas is falling at an alarming rate.

This was rejected on the grounds the matter was better dealt with by the NEC and SEC, something which could take several weeks.

The proposals are part of a five-point plan to revive town centres and stem their decline following the dficulties faced by a string of major retailers.  Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, said: \"Our high streets need saving from a slow and agonising death.  \"As part of our plan to rebuild Britain and breathe le back into our communities, Labour will scrap ATM charges, deliver free WiFi to town centres, introduce a register of empty properties, provide free bus travel for under 25s and overhaul the broken business rates system which is hammering retail.  \"Boarded-up shops and deserted high streets are a result of years of neglect and austerity. Our country needs to radically change course so our towns can thrive again,\" she told conference.  The high street has been battered this year by several high-profile retail administrations and store closure programmes.  House of Fraser, Maplin and Toys R Us have all gone bust, while New Look, Carpetright and Mothercare have shut stores.  Meanwhile, on the issue of cash machines, there have been widespread closures of ATMs with cuts to funding resulting in the loss of thousands of machines rural areas and Scotland have been the worst affected.  Labour pointed out how the number of people who relied almost entirely on cash had risen to 2.7 million, up by 500,000 over the last two years.  Research by Which?, it said, had shown that the loss of free-to-use ATMs would leave one in 10 people struggling to make payments, forcing consumers out from local shops and services.  Labour analysis has found that in the last three years alone 100,000 jobs in the retail sector have been lost. British Retail Consortium research also shows that a fth of British retailers are planning to cut the number of people they employ in the next three months.  Scottish Labour MP Ged Killen, who has been campaigning to maintain ATMs, said he welcomes his party\u0026rsquos commitment to ban ATM charges and ensure people could access their own cash for free.  \u0026ldquoIn Scotland, a free-to-use ATM is closing at a rate of one a day, he declared.  \u0026ldquoThis means every day a there is one less place to take out money for the school lunches or one less place to withdraw money to pay in local shops, noted the Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP.  \u0026ldquoNo one should have to pay to access their own money.

The survey found 8% of adults had experienced food insecurity in 2017, with this defined as being a worry they would run out of food because of financial problems.  This affected one in five  adults aged 16 to 64 who were living alone.  The report said there was a \u0026ldquosignicant association between area deprivation and food insecurity in 2017, noting that 18% of those in the most deprived areas had been worried about running out of food at some point in the last 12 months, compared to 3% of people in the least deprived areas.  Charities Oxfam Scotland, the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, Nourish Scotland and The Poverty Alliance joined forces to set up A Menu for Change \u0026ndash a project aimed at tackling food insecurity and poverty.  Policy officer Mary Anne MacLeod said: \u0026ldquoThese statistics paint a grim picture of hunger across the country. Given Scotland isn\u0026rsquot facing a food shortage, this is clearly a problem of widespread poverty.  \u0026ldquoThe figures show 16 to 44 year olds are most likely to be going hungry. We know low wages, zero-hour contracts, frozen benefit levels and the introduction of Universal Credit are pushing more and more people to the brink.  \u0026ldquoWhen so many people are struggling to make ends meet you know something has gone badly wrong with the system.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why our political leaders must urgently fix the system, in our rich country no-one should be constantly worrying about how they\u0026rsquore going to feed their kids. We can do better than that. Everyone should be able to access the money they need to put food on the table.  A Scottish Government spokesman: \u0026ldquoNo one should experience food insecurity in a country as prosperous as Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe are directly challenging the causes of food insecurity by promoting the living wage and embedding a rights-based approach in our new social security system.  \u0026ldquoWe continue to challenge the UK Government\u0026rsquos punitive welfare policies and continued austerity, which takes money out of the pockets, and food out of the mouths, of the most vulnerable in our society. We expect to spend \u0026pound125 million this year alone in mitigating UK Government welfare measures.  \u0026ldquoWe have increased our Fair Food Fund to \u0026pound1.5 million this year, rising to \u0026pound3.5 million next year, to reduce and over time remove the need for food banks."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-unveils-plan-to-kickstart-green-jobs-revolution-with-creation-of-400000-jobs","story":"  In his speech to Labour\u0026rsquos annual conference in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn will accuse \u0026ldquothe political and corporate Establishment of propping up the financial system which caused misery to millions following the crash of 2008.  And he will say that Labour is ready to deliver \u0026ldquothe radical plan we need to rebuild and transform Britain, telling delegates: \u0026ldquoThe old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  Mr Corbyn will say Britain needs a government \u0026ldquocommitted to investing in renewables, in jobs and in training, and will promise large-scale public and private investment in wind and solar power, as well as subsidies to make all homes energy-efficient.  The insulation programme alone would create 160,000 jobs alone spread across the UK.  Changes to planning guidance will aim to encourage private investment to double onshore wind power over 12 years, while offshore wind will be increased sevenfold and solar power threefold.  \u0026ldquoScotland would clearly benefit extensively from this level of investment in terms of jobs and living standards, and it is something that would be very welcome in Scotland, stressed the Labour leader\u0026rsquos spokesman.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos speech comes at the end of a four-day conference which has been dominated by Brexit but has seen the Labour leader and shadow chancellor John McDonnell set out a range of policies to reverse inequalities in wealth and economic power.  These have ranged from workers in the boardroom to employee shareholding funds and new taxes on second homes south of the Border.  Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoTen years ago this month, the whole edice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.  \u0026ldquoBut instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate Establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. People in this country know \u0026ndash they showed that in June last year \u0026ndash that the old way of running things isn\u0026rsquot working any more.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos why Labour is offering a radical plan to rebuild and transform Britain.  Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos comments risk being seen as an attack on former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who led the global response to the financial crash in 2008 with massive intervention to shore up the banks.  Mr Brown warned earlier this month that the world risks \u0026ldquosleepwalking into a new financial crisis because it has failed to address the causes of the previous crash. The former prime minister also said the world was moving into a decade of vulnerability and said tougher action was needed to prevent wrongdoing by bankers.  Aides insisted that the current Labour leader regarded the ex-PM\u0026rsquos decision to take action to avert a collapse in the financial system as \u0026ldquoabsolutely correct.  But his spokesman suggested the costs of the bail-out \u0026ldquowere signicantly higher than they needed be in the nationalisation of RBS and the stake in Lloyds, adding: \u0026ldquoAnd then, of course, the huge sums that were committed through quantitative easing and other forms of financial guarantees were done in ways which in practice have favoured asset owners and the wealthy in society and, of course, the austerity programme has been at the expense of the poorest and the large majority of the population.  Setting out his plans to invest substantially in green jobs, Mr Corbyn will say: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change.  \u0026ldquoWe must lead by example.  Labour\u0026rsquos plans outline a range of measures aimed at boosting energy efficiency, among them proposals which would see \u0026pound12.8 billion invested in an insulation programme over five years. There would also be means-tested subsidies for low-income owner-occupiers and social housing, as well as zero interest loans for home-owners and landlords who are able to pay.  Universal energy efficiency measures \u0026ndash including retrofitting of old properties \u0026ndash would reduce heat demand from buildings by a quarter.  Mr Corbyn will explain: \u0026ldquoThere is no bigger threat facing humanity than climate change. We must lead by example.\u0026ldquoOur energy plans would make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations.  \u0026ldquoThat means working with unions representing the workforce to ensure jobs and skills are protected as we move to a low-carbon economy."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-says-remaining-in-eu-would-be-option-in-any-future-peoples-vote","story":"  Ahead of his keynote speech today, the Labour leader was asked  he backed the earlier assertion by Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, who told conference: \u0026ldquoNo one is ruling out Remain as an option.  Mr Corbyn told Sky News: \"Those are the words of the motion that was supported by the National Executive and the Shadow Cabinet and that is what is being voted on in conference\u0026hellip  \"Keir put that in because it\u0027s what\u0027s there in the motion. We will challenge this Government. If they don\u0027t meet our six tests, we will vote against it, and then we will take it from there, he declared.  Yesterday, the party\u0026rsquos rt over the nature of a so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote was laid bare after John McDonnell insisted Remain would not be part of the question put to voters in any second referendum. Later, Sir Keir insisted it would be.  And in his keynote conference speech yesterday he again claimed not only had Remain to be an option in any future referendum but no-one, including the Shadow Chancellor, was ruling it out.  However, during an at times passionate debate on Brexit, Steve Turner, Assistant General Secretary of Unite the union, told delegates that  the Tories were not brave enough to call a general election, then Labour would \u0026ldquodemand they go back to the people with a vote on the deal.  He went on: \u0026ldquoThat is not in a second referendum, despite what Keir Starmer may have said earlier, it will be a public vote, that\u0026rsquos a vote on the terms of our departure.  In his conference address, Sir Keir made clear the party was set to vote against Theresa May\u0026rsquos Brexit plan when it was put to a Commons vote and that a general election should be triggered  she were unable to win Westminster\u0026rsquos approval.  As he went through the key passage, delegates regularly applauded ious sections and at one point around two-thirds of delegates rose to their feet.  The Shadow Secretary of State argued that  Labour could not secure a general election, then \"we must have other options that must include campaigning for a public vote\".  He went on: \"It is right that Parliament has the first say but,  we need to break the impasse, our options must include campaigning for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option.\"  After the Brexit debate, delegates approved by a show of hands the proposed motion, which, in the event of the Government\u0026rsquos Brexit plan failing to get MPs\u0026rsquo support, called for a general election with the option of a second referendum  one did not happen.

More than 1,800 people have taken part in a major consultation so far, voicing their opinion on efforts to boost the area’s recycling rate and reduce the volume of material sent to landfill.                                                     A package of changes is being proposed, including reducing the size of non-recyclable bins, increasing each household’s recycling capacity and improving the network of Household Waste Recycling Centres, closing some smaller facilities.                                                    Two options to change kerbside waste collections are proposed as part of the revamped collection system and people are encouraged to share their views with the council on this.        Responses will feed into a new waste strategy being developed, aimed at ensuring the area maximises the environmental, local and financial benefits from the waste it produces as a community.Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate is 43.5%, but services currently available to residents should allow a recycling rate of over 70%. Over half of the materials put into local non-recyclable waste bins are actually recyclable through existing services – equating to around 30,000 tonnes of recyclable materials being binned at a cost of £3.5million a year.Sending waste to landfill costs twice as much as recycling, so not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other council services.                                                                                                        Chairman of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee , Peter Argyle, said: “Clearly a signicant number of people have already given their views and as councillors we will of course take those into account when making what are important decisions about how we all deal with the waste we produce. “There are however around 118,000 households in Aberdeenshire who will be affected by these changes, so we’d be keen to have as many of their views as possible too.” ISC vice chair, John Cox, said: “Recycling and waste services will be used by just about everyone who lives in this area, so any changes to that service will of course have an impact. “Anyone who wants to have their views included as we make decisions on how services are delivered should spend a little time learning about what’s proposed by participating in the consultation.”                                                                                                         Take part and give your views on the package of proposals here.

It’s going to be a very special night.” LCpl Mair plays the cornet and has recently ed from the Far East where she provided musical and ceremonial support in South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan and Indonesia.                                                                                                        To accompany the centenary tour, there is also a CD – Walking with Heroes – which will commemorate 100 years since the end of The Great War, and honour those that served our nation so valiantly. The programme includes works by such iconic composers as Holst, Shostakovich, John Williams and Karl Jenkins alongside new compositions and arrangements. These include traditional Scottish fayre and feature a whole host of soloists in particular the unmistakable skirl of the pipes.Gordon Michie, head of fundraising, said: “It is a privilege for Poppyscotland to be in partnership with such a talented group of musicians. “The tour is providing a great opportunity for music lovers across the country to experience the unmistakable and memorable sound of Scotland’s State Band.                                                                                                         “We urge the public to get their hands on tickets for the performance as soon as possible as they are already selling out fast.”As well as the tour itself, the band is undertaking another fundraising effort in the form of The 1918 Poppy Pledge.

He owned substantial property in the new and bustling Pulteneytown and settled himself in his property at Sibster where the young Alexander grew up.Alexander attended Pulteneytown Academy, going on to study natural history and natural philosophy at Edinburgh University.Following his work in 1851 on the cairns at Yarrows, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries at 19 years of age. He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Wednesday 26 Sep 2018 2:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Wednesday 26 Sep 2018 2:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online.

In the end, it was the kind auspices of the Harcus family that saw the OMS safely installed in Maitland Place last September.The early days of converting the former fishing shed to its current layout has taken lots of volunteer time and energy and will be ongoing for some time yet. In the meantime, the shed is set up with a tea/meeting room, a kitchen and facilities, and working space, and early projects have included the new shed at The Blue Door, outdoor musical equipment for Glaitness School and the livestock signs for the County Show park — amongst a myriad of others.As a self funded group in these dficult times we are grateful for those who have supported us: from the larger organisations including: Age Scotland, Cooke Aquaculture, Orkney Partnership Board Positive Ageing Delivery Group, Orkney Rotary Club, Orkney Seafarer’s Association and RVS Asda, through to each and every member of our 200 club, and everyone who has supported our fundraising events, including a very successful week in the Blue Door last week and at the local Shows.All are invited to attend the celebrations at The Shed at Maitland Place in Finstown, which will be open to the public on Saturday, September 29 from 10am to 4pm.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor. Normally I\u0026rsquom sceptical about these sort of competitions but this has been great. It\u0026rsquos an opportunity for everyone to take a look at what they\u0026rsquore doing. There have been lots of local winners through a competition run by Visa and we\u0026rsquoll have a pop-up workshop on social media. These competitions can sometimes give a helpful kick to improve things.\"High Streets minister Jake Berry hailed Alness and said: \"The awards celebrate the great work that is being done to revive, adapt and ersy the nation\u0026rsquos high streets and the quality of entries this year has been outstanding. This is a great opportunity to show your support for the hard work going on in Alness High Street so get voting!\"Sundeep Kaur, head of UK and Ireland merchant services at Visa, added: \"Alness High Street is a fantastic example of a high street that has made huge strides in transforming itself to offer a range of dferent experiences for locals and visitors alike.\"In particular, its entry highlighted the shopkeepers in Alness who have worked hard to provide an exciting shopping experience, with each committing to offering something unique and which offers choice for consumers.\"The shortlisted high streets will now battle it out in a public vote, which accounts for 30 per cent of the final scoring, and will then have the chance to impress an expert judging panel as they seek to be crowned Britain\u0026rsquos best.Those interested in participating in the public vote can visit www.thegreatbritishhighstreet for more information.Inspiration for other Ross-shire High Streets?

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Wednesday 26 Sep 2018 2:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However Scottish Water has been in regular contact with stakeholders and I will wait to hear the assurances given to the community next week.\"The event will run between 3.30pm and 7.30pm on Monday.Share your views on the proposals by emailing newsdesk@spp-group or writing to us at the address on our letters page.Wednesday 26 Sep 2018 2:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The atmospheric walk is a magnet for visitors and local alike.The Avoch Primary School pupil\u0026rsquos mother Julie Mackay reported the \"nasty\" burglary on a community Facebook page prompting a run of comments \u0026ndash including some which suggested the culprits may have a problem with the natural area being studded with colourful wooden toy fairy houses.However, the effort to replace the items was considered a great success despite the dissident tone.Mrs Mackay , of High Street, Rosemarkie, said: \"We replaced the pink boot with the money that had been collected by the Panacea shop in Rosemarkie, which was around \u0026pound20. The shop owner Cornelia Hughes gave them to us at cost price and she also donated the wobbly-roofed house.\"Cornelia is seen by the children as the white witch of the Fairy Glen as she makes \"get well\" lotions and potions and sells fairy dust and crystals in her shop and she dresses up at Halloween looking quite the part. And our local posties Wilma Stewart and Sheila MacDonald donated the watering can fairy house.\"She added: \"We all went to Fairy Glen and the local children helped to glue them down. The reception has been great. The delight on the children\u0026rsquos faces is magical and we\u0026rsquove got more fairy houses coming.\"Wednesday 26 Sep 2018 2:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Two years ago we tackled the seven-mile course when he was only six, this time we walked from Aultbea to Poolewe and have again raised a fantastic amount thanks to our generous supporters,\" said Tom.\"Unlike some Huntington\u0026rsquos disease charities 100 per cent of the money raised for the SHA goes to supporting families living with the condition. They leave research funding to others which, is great for families like us who rely so much on the support they offer.\"Since my we Helen was diagnosed 15 years ago they have been invaluable to our family and our caseworker Gordon Bogan has been immense in helping us cope.\"SHA supports Huntington\u0026rsquos disease families through a national network of specialists, a world leading youth support team and its financial wellbeing service.Huntington\u0026rsquos disease is a complex condition with symptoms that typically begin to develop between the ages of 30 and 50. It causes three main groups of symptoms: changes to thinking processes \u0026ndash a type of early onset dementia loss of muscle control and involuntary movements which lead to loss of speech and swallow, along with mental illness.Those impacted by Huntington\u0026rsquos disease may lose the ability to walk, talk, eat, drink or make decisions and will eventually need 24-hour care. It is also hereditary with each child of those diagnosed at 50 per cent risk of developing the disease. There is currently no cure.It is estimated there are around 1100 people living with Huntington\u0026rsquos disease in Scotland and up to 6000 potentially at risk.\"Now that we have completed the middle distance I think Jacob will be keen on tackling the full 25 miles pretty soon, although I\u0026rsquom not sure  I\u0026rsquoll be joining him without some serious training,\" added Tom.Anyone interested in fundraising for the SHA should contact Linda Winters on 0141 848 0308 or email linda.winter@hdscotland.orgWednesday 26 Sep 2018 2:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804970.1537873330!/image/image.jpg","title":"life expectancy in scotland decreases for first time","story":"        Growth in le expectancy in the UK has come to a halt - and has decreased in Scotland for the first time, new figures show.

While only 1% of people living in the most affluent communities reported having nothing left to eat in the previous 12 months, new figures on food insecurity showed this increased to 10% in the most deprived areas.            Almost a fth  of those living in the worst off areas had been worried about running out of food over the last year - with 21% of single parents reporting this as a concern.            The findings emerged from the 2017 Scottish Health Survey, which for the first time included questions on food insecurity.Campaigners said the results “paint a grim picture of hunger across the country”, adding the problem was due to “widespread poverty”.Almost 3,700 adults and just over 1,600 children across Scotland took part in the 2017 survey - with the findings showing increased consumption of fruit and vegetables.Almost a quarter  of adults ate the recommended five portions a day, the highest total since 2003 - although the figures also showed that 10% had not consumed any fruit or vegetables on the day prior to the survey being carried out.But on average adults in Scotland consumed 3.3 portions of fruit or vegetables, against the highest since 2003, with children 2.9 portions on average - the best since 2008.            The survey found 8% of adults had experienced food insecurity in 2017, with this defined as being a worry they would run out of food because of financial problems.This affected one in five  adults aged 16 to 64 who were living alone, while 7% of Scots reported eating less than they should because of money worries, and one in 25  running out of food at some point in the last year. - Le expectancy in Scotland decreases for first timeThe problem was worst among younger Scots, with 6% of those aged 16 to 44 running out of food, compared to less than 0.5% of those who were 65 or older.            Meanwhile 18% of single adults living alone and single parents said they had eaten less than they should at some point over the past year because of their finances.The report said there was a “signicant association between area deprivation and food insecurity in 2017”, noting that while 18% of those in the most deprived areas had been worried about running out of food at some point in the last 12 months, compared to 3% of people in the least deprived areas.Charities Oxfam Scotland, the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, Nourish Scotland and The Poverty Alliance joined forces to set up A Menu for Change - a project aimed at tackling food insecurity and poverty.Policy officer Mary Anne MacLeod said: “These statistics paint a grim picture of hunger across the country. Given Scotland isn’t facing a food shortage, this is clearly a problem of widespread poverty.“The figures show 16 to 44 year olds are most likely to be going hungry. We know low wages, zero-hour contracts, frozen benefit levels and the introduction of Universal Credit are pushing more and more people to the brink.             - Man jailed after attempted murder of 6 children in hit and run “When so many people are struggling to make ends meet you know something has gone badly wrong with the system.“That’s why our political leaders must urgently fix the system, in our rich country no-one should be constantly worrying about how they’re going to feed their kids. We can do better than that. Everyone should be able to access the money they need to put food on the table.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804635.1537804866!/image/image.jpg","title":"darren mcgarvey what masculinity means is a struggle if you re not woke or a misogynist","story":"        Last week, a hapless \u0026#173Scottish opinion columnist did something a lot of men  have done or will do at some point in their lives \u0026#8211 he made some ignorant remarks about gender in a very public way.                Rather than graty him by repeatedly referring to his meanderings, I’ll use them as a jump-off point to explain why ­Brian Beacom’s rant is not only unhelpful to women, but also to discussion about the other side of the gender coin: masculinity.            In this age of growing awareness of the myriad challenges many women face, I am trying to reason as honestly and openly as I can. I feel it is my responsibility to look beyond the first emotional impulse on any given issue and try to see the bigger picture.             Admittedly, this hasn’t been an easy road, and especially true where gender is ­concerned. It took me a long time to reconcile the ­personal experience of feeling frightened by women as a kid with the political and cultural reality that many of the challenges, prejudices and threats women face are – like many of the roles assigned to them by society – a direct result of their gender. The notion that so many ­women feel powerless, threatened or afraid was hard to map onto my own experience, where women always appeared to be in charge – sometimes ruling with an iron fist. Realising the personal and political are not mutually exclusive has been bumpy and sometimes frightening. In the age of social media it requires almost no effort to be extremely uncharitable, whether dishing it out or on the receiving end. Beacom makes a mockery of those of us who are grappling with matters of gender and masculinity, sometimes counterintuitively. It takes a lot of work  to resist hardwired reactions to a cascade of conflicting social media posts, blogs, articles and news stories. Where, often, men are discussed in generalities that do not account for the specicity of our experiences and where we are often commanded to “talk about our feelings” and “stop making it all about us” simultaneously. It was hard for me to accept, for example, that my mother’s aggression and violence towards me was, as I have heard it said, simply another form of toxic masculinity – that her abusive behaviour was rooted in trauma she experienced at the hands of men when she was a young woman. I had a lot of baggage to unpack and as I did so, much of it on public platforms, I was accosted on occasion. Sometimes my assailants had a point. Sometimes that point was drowned out by social media hyperbole. Ironically, the people who were most helpful, compassionate and understanding were other feminists who valued a willingness to ­examine my own attitudes and behaviour over a carefully constructed avatar that always knew the wokest thing to say.I licked my wounds and kept going. All around me I could see once powerful men being recontextualised as predators and abusers. One thing they all had in common was a seemingly sincere belief that they had done nothing wrong. It struck me that, just because I didn’t regard myself as ever harming, harassing or abusing anybody, this didn’t automatically mean I hadn’t. But this is a dficult thing to confront, especially in the public domain, when you are caught in the crossfire between two types of men who are always engaged in the ­discussion around gender.            In one corner, we have the woke bros. They are a good lot. They use whatever means available to echo the sentiments expressed by progressive women. They observe the day’s contested gender story through a feminist lens and are keen to be seen publicly standing in solidarity with whatever their comrades think. You’ll find them right across the political spectrum and, ostensibly, they were born with all the correct opinions and attitudes installed – because we never hear how they came to be so woke. Also, you rarely hear anything from them about their experiences as men, in relation to women. Nothing about what they struggle with, or those attitudes and behaviours in their private lives that haven’t always so conveniently aligned with their public proclamations. Apparently, we are to believe these guys have never intruded on a woman’s privacy out of emotional insecurity, never gratied themselves to ethically nightmarish porn and never harboured a hateful thought or said or done something that berated, hurt, pressured or harmed a woman.  Some of them even want us to accept that we live in a patriarchy that infects all who emerge from it with misogynistic impulses, but that they, themselves, are strangely unaffected.Maybe I’m just jealous because I am so evidently flawed. But while I am sure the many women with whom the woke bros stand in solidarity are thrilled to see their allies batting for the right team, the woke bros are virtually useless when it comes to engaging sections of the male population who, like me, have not been so perfectly configured, men who perhaps sense that they must change but require guidance from other men on the path – as opposed to Twitter pointers from men who only speak publicly about other behaviour and not their own. Then we have Brian Beacom types. Men who’ll go to the grave believing the song and dance they made about gender equality was a valiant cry from the wilderness – and not the agonal gasp of a privileged but increasingly irrelevant perspective. Somewhere between the woke bros and the Beacoms, sit men like me, trying to carve out a new lane where a more honest and potentially vulnerable conversation about masculinity must take place. Which is what must happen  the struggle for gender equality is ever to arrive at its final destination.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804714.1537815363!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment labour party line offers little hope","story":"        The Labour Party conference will this afternoon vote on whether to \u0026#8220keep all options on the table\u0026#8221 when it comes to Brexit.                This aspiration, broad and vague as it is, may include the possibility of campaigning for a new referendum. But before any frustrated Remainers get too excited, it’s worth paying attention to the detail. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and is closest allies at the top of the party are no more enthusiastic about the possibility of a second referendum than they were yesterday.            Keeping all options on the table is language of the most non-committal nature. Anyone who would like to truly understand the Labour leadership’s position should pay attention to remarks made early yesterday by shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who said any so-called “People’s Vote” should be on the terms of the Brexit deal rather than on whether the UK should, in fact, remain part of the EU.            Labour Party members may yesterday have waved banners reading “Hate Brexit – Love Corbyn” but the very most it seems they can hope from the party leadership is support for a referendum which offers a choice between whatever deal Theresa May is able to salvage from the chaos - and a potentially-catastrophic no deal.Later yesterday, Mr McDonnell adopted the “all options on the table” party line but the truth was already out there.  When Mr Corbyn succeeded Ed Miliband as Labour leader in 2015, he promised a new kind of politics but it is becoming increasingly apparent that with increased trade union influence and the centralising of power to a small clique, the modern Labour party is the living breathing example of what we might consider the old politics. And the bad old politics, at that.Prime Minister Theresa May limps on, politically wounded by treacherous colleagues, humiliated by the EU, and struggling to find a vaguely plausible narrative on Brexit. Add to this unfortunate mix polling which shows growing support to reverse the decision take in 2016, and Labour is presented with the opportunity to seize the initiative, and perhaps even help the UK avert the worst impact of Brexit. Yet still he refuses to show leadership.Jeremy Corbyn may have convinced his supporters that they all have a voice in his party. Those who do not parrot the leadership line on Brexit should not, however, expect to be listened to.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick.

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill!

A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country.

Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years.

The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government.

So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”\nMeanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June 2017 showed that 87% of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only 5% opposed.  \nWhen supporters were asked how they would react  Sinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporters  said they would oppose such a move.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.  - Matt Carthy MEP\nSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. \nThe Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from 11am tomorrow. \nIt will feature two panel discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible and  a unity referendum could be won. \nPanellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. \nThe panel discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. \nSpeakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. \nIt is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. \nSpeaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \n\"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \n\"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \n\"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \n\"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan Kearney\nTheannual British-Irish Association  conference convened last weekend inOxford, England.\nAt thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.\nOnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  \nTheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.\nTheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.\nThe RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that party\u0027s purportedadherence to \u0027good governance’.\nIanPaisley\u0027s misconduct \u0026amp discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.\nThe DUPjust does not get it!\n\nThatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on 9th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.\nYet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.\nAndeven  the British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.\nInreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.\nThey have already decided the party should notcontest the 2019 local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. It\u0027s increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.\nLastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.\nThefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.\nTheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.\nIn myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that 25years of progress could be squandered.\nIrepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.\nThefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.\n\nAnd thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.\nThereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.\nSinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.\nPartitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.\nIt hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. \nThesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.\nTheCivil Rights Movement 50 years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.\nThis belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since 1998. \nTherefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast 18 months.\nThegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.\nThey wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.\nThe politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.\nOver 20 years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.\n\nVerysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.\nA newgeneration is questioning partition.\nTherepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.\nBrexithas become a defining moment for these islands.\nIthas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.\nThedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.\nThesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.\nTheydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.\nThereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.\nNegativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince 2010, must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.\nInitially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.\nFormany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.\nForthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.\nHowever, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.\nIt istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.\nIn parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity.\n Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.\n\nA GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.\nTheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.\nPoliticalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. \nToomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.\nSocietalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.\nDemographicshts in the north are irreversible.\nIt isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.\nSomevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.\nHowever,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.\nUnionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.\nNo onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.\nThe 20%which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.\nAminority should be cherished because it enriches society.\nDiversityshould be celebrated and respected.\nThispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.\nPoliticaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.\nRepublicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.\nThiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.\nTheopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.\nSinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.\nButfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.\nWhocould have imagined 30 years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.\n\nThemodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.\nMandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”\nIrishunity is both reasonable and achievable.\nIrelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.\nWe arestronger as a people for that.\nSinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.\nThereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.\nThis isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a dference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such le-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back. We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus       false     else         your_email.focus       false     else         friends_name.focus       false     else         friends_email.focus       false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random  false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVery Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn           false                .click .parents.fadeOut           false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus             false           else               password.focus             false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n                false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy  2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

demonstration.\n\n                \nAnticipation is mounting ahead of this year’s second annual Calor NI Leisure Show, as dozens of exhibitors joined forces recently in an action-packed launch at Lisburn’s impressive Eikon Centre.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving.

But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them. Where do these women go for help? They are being left on the scrapheap and that’s just heartbreaking.”\n\nJackie is urging women who need help and advice about vaginal mesh implants to contact her via her Facebook page ‘TVT POP Mesh Problems N Ireland’ or by email: meshgirlni@icloud\n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8639705.1537348575!/image/image.jpg","title":"storm ali latest motorists advised that m1 has reopened","story":"                \nEarlier the motorway was closed in both directions between Lisburn and Blacks Road due to a power line down across the road.\n\nwindow.twttr =  [0],    t = window.twttr ||      t  js = d.createElement  js.id = id  js.src = \"https:platform.twitter/widgets.js\"  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore   t._e = []  t.ready =        t\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n.tweety\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEarlier a post on PSNI Banbridge Facebook said: \"This will cause signicant disruption so please find an alternative route.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Please share.\"\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nA PSNI spokesman added: \"M1 Motorway is closed westbound from Black\u0027s Road Dunmurry and east bound from Saintfield Road due to fallen cables.\n\n\"Motorists should seek alternative routes. \n\n\"Saintfield Road is also closed at the junction of the old Ballynahinch Road due to a fallen tree. \n\n\"Motorists are advised to exercise extreme caution in adverse weather conditions.

Michael explained how the runaway success of his creation has seen views of up to 900,000 on the page, and that his characters are now set to come to le at the Waterfront in October.\n“I grew up with three older sisters, I’m the only boy and the youngest so a lot of my inspiration has come from my family, I’ve seen and heard it all,” he laughed.\n“The Facebook page has become so successful that it makes you want to do more, keep creating, keep entertaining people. I remember when I posted the first video and people were commenting underneath saying ‘more, more’.”\nMichael’s only foray on the stage so far was “when I was in Primary Seven in St Kevin’s and I wore my mummy’s white skinny jeans to play the Angel Gabriel,” he laughed.\n“I feel brilliant that I’m going to be performing all the characters for the first time at the Waterfront. I’ve never seen anything like this, like the following the site has, it’s crazy, but good crazy,” he said.\nThe show will be directed by Alan McKee, one half of comedic duo Grimes and McKee, and himself no stranger to the director’s chair.\n“Joe Rea, who is producing the show, spoke to me about Michael and said ‘this guy is very funny, I think there is a show here’. I ran Michael’s page past the focus group of teenage girls in my house and they loved it, there are plenty of songs and dance routines for everyone to take part in.\n“The fact we are putting on the show shows the power of social media, you can’t ignore that number of hits, that amount of likes and views.\n“Michael has a great ear, he writes exactly the way people speak, warts and all. He is a really original voice.\n“This is the first time I’m directing a piece that has come this way and it has really opened my eyes to look out for other things that don’t necessarily come via the traditional route,  it’s good people will pick up on it. It’s a version of word of mouth just how successful Belfast Girls has become which is the best publicity you can get.”\nBelfast Girls will be performed at the Waterfront from October 9-20.

He just went from a child to an adult.\n\n“As he grew up as an adult, he turned to a spiral of drink and drugs. He thought it was helping him but in reality it wasn’t. He didn’t know when to stop.\n\n“His doctor wrote him a letter, basically saying could he be housed in some sort of sheltered accommodation. It never happened.\n\n“As parents, we were desperate. He was either sitting in his room or out on the drink and drugs.\n\n“He couldn’t get out of the loop he was in. He needed serious help and he just was not getting it. It was a constant cycle that was going downwards. He needed professional help to deal with the grief he suffered.”\n\nIn April, Billy and Sharon were told by Social Services that it was not safe for Sebastian to live in the family home with his younger brother  and three sisters, ,  and .\n\n“As  putting him on to the street was the solution for a vulnerable adult who has addiction and mental health problems,” added Billy. “Social Services’ attitude was basically Sebastian is out of the house and the kids are safe. Now their big brother is dead. They are going to need counselling. It is just a vicious circle.\n\n“We are terried of a knock-on effect. What  someone else in our family decides to take their own le? We were given no help to find him somewhere. We had to find him some sort of sheltered dwelling to live in.”\n\nOn August 13, Sebastian’s West Belfast flat and the Haggan family home were raided by police who claimed they had a warrant to search for ammunition and weapons. The family have complained about the searches to the Police Ombudsman. Sebastian took his own le just five days later and Billy believes the raid set him over the edge. \n\n“Sebastian was out on the streets again after the raid when his landlord put him out. I got him sorted with a place in Ballymena. Five days after the raid, he killed himself. I think it was a trigger – he just could not cope with any more stress.\n\n“He was found with heroin paraphernalia lying around him. We are still waiting on official confirmation but it seems pretty likely he took a heroin overdose to end his own le. Earlier this year, he told his sister the best way to commit suicide was a heroin overdose. He was right.”\nBilly and Sharon have criticised the system which they say is failing people suffering from mental health issues.\n“Sebastian needed professional help but it just was not there. We begged for help from a psychiatrist and for him to be sectioned but nobody would do it.\n\n“We think he attempted suicide on three occasions before. After the second attempt when his sister rescued him from jumping off a bridge, the hospital said he was ‘stable’ and that he ‘wasn’t that bad’. \n\nSebastian himself was willing himself to get help. What more did he need to do? He’d just tried to take his own le. The authorities need to listen to families who are suffering. The system has crashed, it simply does not exist. Hospitals just cannot deal with the issue. \n\nPoliticians need to start doing something. There is a deluge of mental health patients at the moment and basically no help out there for them. Nobody seems to want to tackle the problem. More mental health staff and teams are needed.\n\n “We tried everything we could. At the end of the day, Sebastian was the one who injected himself and killed himself but it all goes back to mental health issues. \n\n“We won’t be the last family to suffer. I wouldn’t like to think what the total number of suicides will rise to. There are more people killed by suicide than on the roads now.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues in this article, call Leline on 0808 808 8000 or PIPS on 02890 805850.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"west belfast man wont face second trial","story":"\n\nA man\n who admitted preventing the lawful burial of his elderly neighbour will not face a trial for stealing a second bank card from her burgled flat.\nSentencing of Robert Sharkey, 24, originally of Larkspur Rise, will take place next month.\nHe was convicted of 11 charges, including using one of Marie Conlon\u0026#8217s debit cards to buy nearly £6,000 worth of pizza.\nA remaining charge of theft of a debit card will remain on the books.\nThe remains of 68-year-old Ms Conlon were discovered in the bedroom of her West Belfast flat off the Suffolk Road last October.\nSharkey – a neighbour at the time – was arrested and subsequently charged with preventing the lawful burial of a corpse on dates between August 2015 and October 2017.\nSharkey, now with an address at Grays Hill in Bangor, pleaded guilty to preventing her lawful burial and to breaking into her home and taking batteries, tools and a coffee mug, and also of stealing both £50 in cash from her, and a First Trust debit card.\nHe also entered guilty pleas to six separate counts of fraud by false representation,  namely using Ms Conlon\u0026#8217s First Trust bank card without authority to buy food totalling £5,988.39 from Domino\u0026#8217s Pizza over a period from October 2015 to 2017.\nHe also bought goods from Sainsbury\u0026#8217s to the value of £3,279.80 from July 2016 to October 2017, and purchased mobile phone credit amounting to £1,030 from March 2016 to October 2017.\nSharkey also admitted using the card to pay Power NI £285, as well payments to the Land and Property Service of £573.83 in September 2016, and £586.20 the following September.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36692914.ece/19ee7/AUTOCROP/w140square/air.jpg","title":"free belfast telegraph transfer test answer booklets","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Pointing toward the absence of the Executive, the airport said it was of \"greater concern\" there was a lack of any economically driven strategy which was creating setbacks. \n\n\"The basic fact remains that the flight schedule provided by the airline from Belfast  was neither flexible nor attractive enough to appeal to the local travelling public,\" she said.\n\n\"There is signicant – and prospectively increasing – market demand between Northern Ireland and the USA / Canada, particularly focused upon New York and Toronto as gateways.\"\n\nShe added: \"The Northern Ireland – North America market remains strong. We will continue to work to ensure that partner airlines are encouraged to serve our market in an appropriate and sustainable manner.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit 60 back special status for northern ireland in poll of 4000 online belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The EU is insisting in the event of a no deal Northern Ireland remains part of the single market and customs union in order to ensure freedom of movement across Ireland. \n\nHowever, this has been rejected by the Prime Minister, parliament and unionists who say it will create a border in the Irish Sea effectively breaking up part of the UK. \n\nDan O\u0027Brien, chief economist at the Institute of International and European Affairs, writing in the Irish Independent, said a referendum may be the only way to \"legitimise\" whatever decision is eventually taken.\n\n\"It might let Leo Varadkar and Theresa May off the potentially career-ending hook that they are both now on,\" he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dups ian paisley asked council to pay for 1500 table at dinner council chief embarrassed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Foster has said she is accountable for her former special adviser, but not responsible for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nThe appointment and actions of DUP special advisers  came under scrutiny on Tuesday at an inquiry into a botched green energy scheme.\n\nThe former first minister for Northern Ireland made the distinction when asked about her former spad Dr Andrew Crawford.\n\nMrs Foster claimed while giving evidence to the RHI inquiry that Dr Crawford never raised with her allegations that the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme was being abused, or the potential for a spike in applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Andrew Crawford\n\n\n\n\nShe told the inquiry she now believes both of those issues should have been brought to her attention when she was Stormont’s finance minister in 2015.\n\nThe inquiry also heard evidence Dr Crawford sent confidential government documents to family members who were RHI claimants.\n\nCounsel to the inquiry David Scoffield asked Mrs Foster that  the panel finds Dr Crawford breached standards, to what degree is she responsible for his actions as his former minister.\n\nMrs Foster responded by telling the inquiry that she was accountable for Mr Crawford’s behaviour, as she was for other officials in the departments she had served in.\n\n\n\nIf he had committed a criminal offence as a spad, I don\u0027t see how the panel would be asking me to be responsible for that\nArlene Foster\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she insisted that she is accountable, but not responsible.\n\n“If he had committed a criminal offence as a spad, I don’t see how the panel would be asking me to be responsible for that,” she said.\n\n“I’m accountable but I’m not responsible.”\n\nMrs Foster also defended her party’s spads after the inquiry previously heard evidence from former enterprise minister Jonathan Bell about his dficult working relationship with them.\n\nMr Bell claimed the DUP “camouflaged” how they were appointed.\n\nMrs Foster said the DUP is no dferent to other parties in how it appoints its spads.\n\n“All of the special advisers that the DUP appointed were people who had third-level education, and who had an ability to work within the system,” she told the inquiry.\n\n“I am not sure that that can be said about every other special adviser.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"monaghan man accused of

or 700 people - on the number of over-85s in 2016. \n\nSuch an increase might seem insignicant, but it is part of an upward trend over the past decade which has seen the population aged over-85 grow by a third, increasing by 9,200 people between 2007 and 2017. \n\nThis growth is five times faster than any other section of the population, and the number of over-85s in Northern Ireland now stands at 37,200.  \n\nPart of this population are the 274 centenarians  recorded living in Northern Ireland - which is around one for every 10,000 people in the province. \n\nAlmost 90% of centenarians in Northern Ireland are women. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit: Nisra\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nIn 2017 there were a total of 14,430 centenarians living across the United Kingdom. \n\nThe situation in other regions of the United Kingdom reflects that of Northern Ireland, with a growing number of people in the oldest age category . \n\nInterestingly, the UK\u0027s Office of National Statistics has recorded an 85% increase in the number of centenarians over the past 15 years - but says figures show a decrease between 2016 and 2018 due to lower birth numbers during World War One. \n\nThe number is expected to pick up again from 2019, or 100 years from the end of the war. \n\nResponding to the statistics, a NISRA statistician said: “The new figures released today indicate that the population aged 85 or more continues to rise, reaching over 37,000 people in 2017.\n\n“Indeed over the decade , this population sub-group has grown over five times faster than the overall Northern Ireland population.\n\n“Despite the rapid growth those people aged 85 or more today only make up around 2% of our population.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland could become singaporestyle free port after brexit says business chief mckenzie","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nShe is chief executive of recruitment companies which operate in Northern Ireland and the Republic and is policy chairwoman of the Federation of Small Businesses  in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn Northern Ireland small firms employ more than big business and the public sector put together, and Brexit is crucial.\n\nMs McKenzie added: “For us any impact on small business would be very detrimental to the economy.”\n\nShe warned of the effect of a hard Irish border on political stability as well as on the impoverished and those on benefits.\n\n“The marginalised communities need those jobs that a hard Brexit impacting the economy could take away.”\n\nShe has suggested to all political parties the idea of creating a free port.\n\n“That would be transformational for this society, whether you are a unionist, nationalist or neither.\n\n“A good, prosperous Northern Ireland is good for the nationalist cause  they want the Republic of Ireland to vote to have Northern Ireland within the island.\n\n“It is also really good from a unionist perspective because the happier people are in a Northern Ireland, the more prosperous, the less likely they are to want to change the constitutional position.\n\n“So for us it is a no-brainer, it is good for everybody and there is not any party or government that sees that as a threat.”\n\nShe said it also solved Great Britain’s problem of getting trade in through a friendly port, therefore without worrying about dferent customs imposed at the other side.\n\n“They have more control, I guess, with Northern Ireland being part of the UK.\n\n“There is some technical detail to work on but everyone we have floated it with has really been, even people you might be surprised, have been quite open to the idea.\n\n“People seem content enough with it and are asking about how the mechanics might work.”\n\nShe admitted the technicalities still had to be resolved.\n\n“JFK got into office and said in this decade we will have a man on the moon. He was not able to tell them how he was going to get the man on the moon.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"poll should northern ireland have special status after brexit economist calls for referendum on brexit customs arrangements","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But in a dire situation when there are few good options, desperate measures can sometimes be necessary.

Niall Carson/PA.\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May has said any move that would see Northern Ireland’s regulations dfer from the rest of the UK’s, likened to putting a border in the Irish Sea, would be a bad outcome.\n\nHer parliamentary allies, Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionists, are strongly opposed to such a scenario.\n\nThe Prime Minister’s Chequers plan has been assailed by critics and Brexiteers have reiterated their support for finding a technological solution to the border.\n\nMr Varadkar said he had sought a lot of counsel in recent months from “wise old heads” who know Europe and know British politics and know Northern Ireland.\n\nHe added: “I came away from those meetings with the advice that it’s unchartered territory and unpredictable and do your best and I think that was probably the best advice I could have got.”\n\nMr Varadkar said Mrs May had reinstated her commitment to having a legally operative backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement while at an informal summit of European leaders in Salzburg recently.\n\nHe said: “And the EU 27 again in Salzburg gave their full solidarity behind Ireland and restated our position that there won’t be a withdrawal agreement at all, no transition period for the UK  there isn’t an Irish protocol, a legally operative backstop as part of that.”\n\nMeanwhile, during debate in the Irish Dail parliament, the Taoiseach touched on efforts to restore Northern Ireland’s stalled powersharing administration at Stormont.\n\nHe said: “I think clarity around Brexit could help.\n\n“Perhaps  by the October summit, or the November summit  there is one, we’re in a position to have a roadmap as to how Brexit going to work, what the new relationships are going to look like, we might be in a better position then to bring the parties together again.\n\n“Certainly the Government stands ready to do that.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"five things we learnt at labour conference","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It’s not something that keeps me awake at night, in fact nothing keeps me awake at night.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures meghan gets a nose for pacific region on her first solo engagement","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

a position also supported by the Labour party. \n\nThe Cabinet meeting heard from the committee\u0027s head Prof Alan Manning. \n\n\nIts report\n states it is working off the assumption the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland will continue after Brexit, so \"any future restrictions on EEA migration will not apply to the Irish\". \n\n\"Sometimes we refer to the group of UK and Irish as simply the UK-born to make the report more readable,\" the reports states. \n\nMonday\u0027s Cabinet meeting was told that in the post-Brexit immigration system, EEA and non-EEA nationals \"should be part of one universal system\". \n\nIt is on the basis high-skilled migration is of more economic benefit to the United Kingdom than lower skilled migration. \n\nMinisters also agreed that once free movement is brought to an end, the new system tailored to suit the needs of the UK would boost productivity. \n\nDespite this belief, there are fears restricting the movement of lower-skilled labour could potentially damage the UK economy. \n\n\nThe BBC reports\n a Cabinet source as saying the agreement was not a firm decision, and there would be room for \"light touch migration\" for EU nationals as part of a trade deal with the EU. \n\nThe broadcaster\u0027s political editor Laura Kuenssberg notes that ending freedom of movement has become a \"rhetorical non-negotiable for Theresa May\". \n"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say september","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

About half an hour prior to setting the first 4:55 time in history, Kosmic had tied the previous world record – held by a gamer called somewes – after 1,615 attempts, at 4:56.245.\n\nBut to reach 4:55 Kosmic had to attempt “an additional hard trick in level 1-2” something he had done before but never while on a perfect run. Fortunately for Kosmic, he not only nailed the trick after only nine attempts, but managed to maintain his superb run afterwards to claim the record.\n\n“By some miracle  played perfectly to 8-4, where I did lose a little bit of time, but it was enough to get a 4:55,” he told the Press Association. “It’s still hard for me to believe that this happened!”\n\n\nI\u0027m a little overwhelmed right now IF IM BEING HONEST\n— Kosmic  \nSeptember 25, 2018\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve such a record is the stuff of dreams for a gamer, but despite what was at stake it sounds as though the nature of the situation meant nerves didn’t play much of a part.\n\n“Since this was the very first run I had on this pace, there was no way in my mind it was going to be \nthe\n run,” said Kosmic. \n\n“That’s why I was cracking jokes the whole time. Even going into 8-3 I wasn’t that nervous, because there was just \nno way\n it was going to happen.\n\n“It happened so fast that I’ll continue going for a run that plays 8-4 slightly faster. It’s possible to save about 0.2 seconds in 8-4. There are some more ways to save time past that, but I don’t think they’re realistically possible right now.”\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat work, although  you completed it that quickly on the first try you’d maybe wonder  you’d got your money’s worth…\n"},{"url":null,"title":"senate judiciary committee vote on kavanaugh scheduled for friday","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It’s clearly linked with how active we are, the food we eat and the amount of sleep we get. Screen time can displace physical activity and is associated with a pattern of unhealthy snacking. It also increases our children’s exposure to the marketing of unhealthy foods. We need to get this balance right and parents can make a start by reducing their own screen time.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nFor children aged 2-5, the weekday average was approx. 1 hour 49 mins and 2 hours 13 mins at weekends.  For over 5s, the weekday average was almost two hours rising to more than 3 hours at the weekends.\n\nCaroline Bloomfield, Health and Social Wellbeing Improvement Senior Manager at the Public Health Agency said: “Ideally, under 2s should have no screen time while under 5s should have no more than an hour a day. For older children, it’s important to agree set limits that suit your family and to stick to them. Screen time is such a part now of daily le that trying to cut down on it might seem challenging. Children love to copy what others do so  they see Mum or Dad on the smartphone, chances are they’ll want to do the same. Having wind-down time with no screens before bedtime and enjoying more screen free meals together are two good places where parents can make a start.”\n\nThe START campaign aims to provide practical tools and advice for parents, to help them set limits on screen time and to encourage the whole family to become more active. It is encouraging families to make a ‘play pact’ by committing as a family to pause for play and spend less time on their screens. This doesn’t have to be organised physical activity or sport and all movement counts.\n\nFor more information visit:\n \n\nwww.makeastart.org\n It provides lots of simple ideas on getting active in and around the home and ways to make a positive, healthy start.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry sinn fein mla disappointed lack progress new investment bbc ensure equal access gaelic games northern viewers","story":"\nSinn Féin Foyle MLA Raymond McCartney has expressed disappointment at the lack of progress and new investment from the BBC to ensure equal access to gaelic games for northern viewers. \n\nHe was commenting after a Sinn Féin delegation held a meeting with the BBC in Belfast. \n\nRaymond McCartney said: “Sinn Féin met with the BBC on Monday to once again voice our concern at the lack of televised coverage of gaelic games for viewers in the north. \n\n“We are disappointed that BBC have made absolutely no progress or new investment to ensure the quarter of a million gaels in the north have equal access to gaelic games. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“While we welcome the live coverage of the 12 Irish League games, this cannot overshadow the need for more coverage of the GAA which is the largest spectator sport on the island of Ireland. \n\n“Since launching the Fair Play for Ulster Gaels campaign we have heard the frustration felt among GAA fans at what they feel is decades of neglect by BBC in terms of televising and mainstreaming gaelic games.\n\n“We believe that a collaborative approach from sporting organisations and broadcasters is required to end the inequalities surrounding televised coverage and parity of esteem for northern gaels.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"litter loathing puppet reminds people derry keep city tidy","story":"\nPhoto Caption:  Jodie McAneaney, Keep Northern Ireland Beautul’s Live Here Love Here Manager, is pictured with the star of a new anti-litter campaign – a litter loathing puppet who pulls no punches when it comes to offenders!\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mayor gives backing recycling week urges local householders reduce reuse recycle","story":"\nHouseholders across Derry were reminded this week of the need to ‘Reduce, reuse and recycle’ as Recycling Week got underway.\n\nThe Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Councillor John Boyle, gave his backing to the campaign yesterday with the launch of a new furniture restoration course at Council’s New 2 You Re-use facility at Pennyburn Recycling Centre.\n\nLaunching the course, the Mayor said it would provide the opportunity for people to find out new ways of reusing old materials.\n\n“I am delighted to be here today to find out more about the services offered at the New 2 You centre,” he declared.\n\n“The skill and creativity of the staff in breathing new le into old and unwanted household items is extremely impressive and a great way of utilising old materials.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

Even  you start out walking by yourself, you are never alone along the Camino.\n\nThe Camino Portugues, or the Portuguese Way, spans from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela, the final destination being St James\u0026rsquo Church, where the body of St James is said to lay.\n\nIt travels through the province of Galicia in northern Spain, going through the cities of Porto and Pontevedra and along the coastline of Sanxenxo, the Cies Islands, and Baiona.\n\nWhile this Camino way was shorter that the more arduous Camino Del Norte throughout the northern Basque area of Spain, Edmund said that there were other challenges.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe biggest challenge was walking in extreme heat, said Edmund. \u0026ldquoIt was 38 degrees on one day but for the rest of the days it was around 28 degrees. Staying hydrated was also a challenge.\n\nEdmund also enjoys the feeling of having to travel from one hostel to another with just the bare basics, as he says it gives him an understanding of what le is like for those with transitory lestyles.\n\nHowever, he adds: \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a great togetherness and camaraderie as everyone is doing it together.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"First look inside new £16m Down Leisure Centre with ‘wow factor’  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE new \u0026pound16m Down Leisure Centre, which opens its doors to the public in November, has the wow factor those closely involved in its design always promised it would have.\n\nWhile very much a community facility, the ultra-modern and futuristic three-storey building boasts a stunning range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.\n\nWhile the finishing touches are being put to the 6,500 square metre, three-storey Market Street building, the Down Recorder was last week given a sneak preview of the stunning new centre that has been a long time coming.\u0026nbsp\n\nPlans for the new complex were first discussed well over a decade ago and despite raised eyebrows about building the centre in front of the ageing facility it will replace, everything has gone smoothly with council officials delighted they now have a leisure complex that will be the envy of many.\u0026nbsp\n\nThey are confident that once the centre opens its doors to the public, people will recognise the long wait for a new leisure complex has been worth it, with the new vitality suite on the top floor which boasts a sauna, steam room and small pool with its own mini fountain, particularly stunning.\n\nThe spacious and airy entrance foyer opens up to reveal two swimming pools, one of which has a moveable floor. There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees. Organised by a newly named community group \u0026mdash Lecale Training Workshops Ltd \u0026mdash the scheme will cater for young people between the ages of 16 and 19.\n\nLatest unemployment figures put the total number out of work in that age group in Down district at almost 500. The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday. He was 19 year-old Andrew Stephen Martin, of Ascot Park in Belfast.\n\nMr Martin was involved in a head-on collision with a car at a spot known as the Rectory on the Ballykinlar-Clough Road. The accident happened at approximately 2pm and Mr Martin died about two hours later in Downe Hospital.\n\nThe driver of the car, who was a soldier based at Ballykinlar camp, was taken to the Downe, but was later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast suffering from severe facial injuries.\n\nMr Frank Greeves, a local lorry driver, told the Recorder that it one of the most dangerous bends he had ever seen. He asked: \u0026ldquoHow many more lives have to be lost before something is done?\n\nA DoE spokesman said there were no plans to carry out work on the road.\n\nSTRANGFORD \u0026mdash A party of 130 mentally and physically handicapped children and young adults went cruising on Strangford Lough free of charge on Tuesday \u0026mdash courtesy of the Downpatrick Division of the DoE Roads Service.\n\nThe group\u0026rsquo aged between 12 and 25, came from the Downpatrick area and were accompanied by parents and volunteers. They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running. Ready Mix concrete stepped in to provide refreshments.\n\nMr Ray Carter, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister with responsibility for the DoE, was there to see the children off on their cruise.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis a fine and warming gesture by the crews of the ferries to give up their free time. I know to look at the happy faces around me that their kindness is very well received.\n\nKILLYLEAGH \u0026mdash A scheme to turn Killyleagh harbour into a boat and leisure centre has proved to be the straw which broke the back of a group of local residents. Already 104 residents have signed a petition against the scheme which has received outline planning permission.\n\nPut forward by Mr Robert Morrow, a local coal merchant and businessman, it sets out his hopes to construct pontoon jetties, a clubhouse, toilet block, bar, restaurant, chandlery, workshop and car parking spaces.\n\nThe residents, while believing that there is an urgent need for the harbour to be brought up to an acceptable standard, feel that the scheme falls short of that is required and that it is likely to have a \u0026ldquomost undesirable impact on the residential area surrounding the site.\n\nRATHMULLAN \u0026mdash The Rathmullan Mound is to stay \u0026mdash or at least the best part of it is. After four months of intensive archaeological digging, experts have ruled that the Mound is too valuable to be removed, though they have taken away the top section.\n\nBut although the Department of the environment has put a protection order on the site it will not be taking the Mound into public ownership in the way it has done with other ancient monuments.\n\nThat decision is expected to anger local historians and Down councillors, who have been battling to save the monument from demolition and who have called for it to be taken into public charge.\n\nThe Mound is a rath dating back to early Christian times, with evidence of five dferent settlements from 700 AD to the 16th century. The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage. This 1,000 year-old chamber was used by early inhabitants of the area and is still as perfect in parts as it was when it was first built.\n\nBALLYGOWAN \u0026mdash Female wrestling comes to Ballygowan in a big way tonight when Blackfoot Sue takes the ring at The Squire\u0026rsquos Inn.\n\nThe shapely wrestler from the USA gets to grips with another lady grappler, Manchester\u0026rsquos Miss Lena. The bout is sure to be the star attraction at this initial venture by the Ballygowan night spot.\n\nBut several other star bouts are on the programme, including world middleweight champion Adrian Street, Prince Jitsu and Bruce McDonald.\n\nARDGLASS \u0026mdash Hugh Duggan, the newly appointed progressional at Ardglass Golf Club, took up his position at the seaside club on Monday. Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster. He is John James McIlhone, from Kilmore, Crossgar, who graduated with a second class honours BA ision one in history.\n\nIn the junior section Richard Parkes, of Field Marshal Montgomery, came out on top.\n\nSAINTFIELD \u0026mdash A woman was taken to hospital on Saturday night after two cars were involved in an accident on the Crossgar Road, Saintfield.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade.

This year the RUAS are delighted to welcome Paul Trapp, who is travelling from Wisconsin, USA, to judge. The event is also a great chance to interact with 200 dairy related trade exhibitors on the most relevant technological advances, dficulties and solutions in the industry. \u0026nbsp\n  Rhonda Geary, Operations Director, RUAS said: \u0026ldquo2015 saw the move of Winter Fair to our new purpose built exhibition venue, Eikon Exhibition Centre at Balmoral Park. The move has worked brilliantly and attracted one of the largest attendances to date. In preparation for the 31st Winter Fair we have increased the livestock accommodation and now have stalling, washing and milking facilities for 200 cattle. There is 4750m2 of exhibition space and a full house of 200 trade stands. \u0026nbsp\n  During the Winter Fair there is a busy Seminar Suite with talks presented every half hour from 11am until 3.30pm.\n  Dr. John Bailey from AFBI will speak about better phosphorous management, Bobby Irwin of United Feeds presents a paper on getting the lactation to the right start and Roberta Simmons of the YFCU and Barclay Bell, President of the UFU will speak about succession on farms.\n  CAFRE\u0026rsquos Martin Mulholland will be advising on feed efficiency this winter, making optimum use of grass silage \u0026nbspwhile Christopher Osborne form the UFU will speak about dairy commodity markets and the prospects for 2017.\n  Dr. Sam Strain and Sharon Verner from the Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland will look at improved biosecurity and BVD while Jessica Sloss from Red Tractor, speaks about the farm assurance scheme.\n  The live calf rearing demonstration will be making a  for the 2016 Show. \u0026nbspGorteade Cow Care owned by Barry O\u0026rsquoLoughlin will be displaying a fully ing calf igloo with veranda and Heatwave ad lib calf feeder.\u0026nbsp\n  One of the innovative technological features at next week\u0026rsquos Winter Fair will be the Northern Ireland launch of the CalfApp and Calf Cloud by Volac which won gold at Eurotier in Hannover. It gives information about changes in drinking pattern and fluid intakes and monitors calf health.\n  The launch of the Winter Fair was held at Draynes Farm, near Lisburn, where Michael Drayne led a tour of agricultural journalists and industry representatives around his farm and milk bottling plant. The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week. A total of 35 staff are employed in all departments.\n  The Draynes Farm dairy herd uses three Lely Astronaut A4 milking robots. The cows visit the robots on average 3.1 times per day averaging 33 litres per day with some exceeding 50litres. Cows grazed outdoors using a Lely Grazeway \u0026nbsp\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

attend his constituency dinner at a cost to ratepayers of \u0026#1631,500, it has emerged.\n\n                \nA special sitting of the Causeway Coast and Glens council was held in Coleraine earlier this week, where officers explained how £1,500 was paid to sponsor a table at the event hosted by Mr Paisley.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt is one of two councils to have sponsored a table at the dinner event it was revealed in May that Mid and East Antrim Council had done likewise at the same cost to ratepayers. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe Electoral Commission has confirmed it is investigating and is treating that payment as “a donation” to Mr Paisley.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Northern Ireland Auditor’s office has also confirmed to the News Letter that it has looked into the payment as part of a wider audit of Causeway Coast and Glens Council.\n\nUlster Unionist councillor Richard Holmes told the News Letter: “The officers did present councillors with the correspondence surrounding the event. In essence, a phone call had been made by Ian Paisley Jr to the director of leisure and development Richard Baker, basically offering an invite to what he  communicated to be a business engagement dinner.\n\n“Council took him up on the offer and invited guests along from local business, the local community etc.\n\n“Council went along to the event, but they were not under the impression that it was a fundraiser. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The Northern Ireland Audit officers put a few shots across the boughs of the council, saying that you were being asked to co-ordinate with the DUP MP’s office. The audit office was basically saying there should have been a few alarm bells ringing.\n\n“The chief executive  did say he was embarrassed at the whole thing.”\n\nMr Holmes added: “I believe the council officers acted in good faith, but at this stage we do not know  council has inadvertently made a donation to a political party – but of course the Electoral Commission is investigating.”\n\nSinn Fein councillor Cara McShane, meanwhile, said: “Ratepayers have a right to be angry at this decision and Causeway Coast and Glens Council should immediately take steps to have the money reimbursed back into the public purse.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMr Paisley said in a statement: “I am content to await the outcome of the  Commission’s inquiry, commenced after political rivals made a complaint.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n

understanding of some of the key flaws in the RHI scheme and was making suggestions which would not have addressed some of those flaws \u0026#8211 yet Mrs Foster said he never told her of the issues.\n\n                \nThe DUP leader faced question after question about how her closest aide Andrew Crawford – who was a hand-picked DUP member given a publicly funded salary of about £85,000 a year – had been in repeated contact with another DUP special advisor, Tim Cairns, who says that the contact served to delay cost controls.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nDr Crawford has denied that allegation.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEmails which the inquiry has obtained under its sweeping powers of compulsion show that from at least summer 2015 Dr Crawford was aware of how easily the scheme could be abused and was fully expecting a huge spike in applications from poultry farmers.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nMrs Foster said that Crawford never told her “at any time” that there was a perverse incentive at the heart of the scheme whereby it paid poultry farmers to heat their poultry houses when they were empty.\n\nShe said that Dr Crawford should have told her about the abuse of the scheme and also “probably” about his understanding that there would be a “huge spike” in applications to the scheme because word had spread throughout the industry.\n\nInquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said: “This is why one would get so concerned about your selection of Spad. It looks as though, throughout the summer, your Spad – who was the Spad for the minister responsible for DFP, which in my limited understanding is the department in charge of public money – he’s having a series of exchanges that involve, for example, waste heat which is taking up public money, he’s making a suggestion that you should have 3,000 hours [for boilers to get the most lucrative tarf] rather than 1,314 in the interests of Moy Park, he suggests setting up a meeting with Moy Park ... all of this is done by an unelected Spad and about which you as the minister have no knowledge.”\n\nMrs Foster replied: “Yes, but I think in terms of the Moy Park issue, it’s my understanding that he was saying ‘there seems to be a problem because they’re able to run it for a lot higher than they need, and  you reduce it down then that will deal with the issue of fraud. Am I right on that?”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nSir Patrick asked why her Spad had not come back to her and said “this has an impact on public expenditure”.\n\nMrs Foster said: “Well, I think  Andrew was here he would – and this is not an excuse, and I don’t want it taken as an excuse – but he would say that he thought he was dealing with Annual Managed Expenditure [meaning it was paid for by the Treasury, not Stormont], instead of it coming out of the block grant.\n\n“That’s not an excuse, but I think that’s something he would say.”\n\nSir Patrick said: “Even  he was, he’s also talking about abuse.” Mrs Foster said: “But I think that’s why he’s making a suggestion to deal with that in terms of policy.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nSir Patrick replied: “All I’m saying is that here we have an unelected Spad who doesn’t go back to the minister but who assumes the mantle of negotiator with another Spad. And the first thing you know about it is what? In December or later?” Mrs Foster said she first realised in December.\n\nAt that point the inquiry’s technical assessor interjected to highlight that contrary to what Mrs Foster had said – that Dr Crawford had made a proposal to deal with abuse of the scheme – that actually Dr Crawford’s proposal was to maintain the generosity of the scheme, to the benefit of Moy Park users, something which

Fein claimed credit for securing \u0026#8211 was projected to cost taxpayers \u0026#16391.5 million, the inquiry has been told.\n\n                \nBy that stage in February 2016, the scheme was operating with cost controls but there was still a sense of urgency about closing it, given the mounting cost to the taxpayer.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nContemporaneous emails show that senior Sinn Fein figures were claiming credit for the two-week delay.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMrs Foster admitted that when the scheme was finally closed a decision had been taken by the DUP and Sinn Fein – without consulting the other Executive parties or taking detailed advice from civil servants about the potential cost – to delay closure for two weeks.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe two-week timeframe was effectively plucked out of thin air, she admitted, amid negotiations between DUP and Sinn Fein Spads – a form of “brokerage” which she suggested was commonplace under devolution.\n\nThe cost of that decision will be slashed  the courts uphold retrospective cuts to subsidies which have since been made by Stormont.\n\nGiven that the DUP and Sinn Fein jointly agreed that approach, Mrs Foster said that “we have to take that on the chin”.\n\nThe former first minister also told Sir Patrick Coghlin’s inquiry that the late deputy first minister Martin McGuinness was aware of a whistle-blower who in January 2016 approached her with a series of allegations about how the scheme was being abused.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe note claimed people were abusing the RHI scheme by running boilers 24/7 and all year round for financial gain and in some cases heating empty sheds.\n\nSenior Sinn Fein adviser Aidan McAteer has claimed to the inquiry that the note “was not shared” with Mr McGuinness “at that

country singer \"Big Tom\" McBride has praised a new statue of him as a \"fitting tribute\".\n\n                \nIrish President Michael D Higgins unveiled the monument to Big Tom in Castleblayney on Sunday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe praised it as \"a wonderful testament to the popularity of Big Tom\".\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"That love for Big Tom, his music and the man he was is something that you know best but of course share, not only with people across our island of Ireland, not only in Irish communities across the world, but with many other peoples from dferent cultures,\" he said.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBig Tom, who was a huge star in the 60s and 70s, died in April aged 81, as the statue and festival in his honour were in the process of being planned.\n\nThe entertainer\u0027s son, Thomas, described the unveiling of the bronze statue of his father as a celebratory moment, tinged with sadness.\n\nThe Co Monaghan town centre was packed on Sunday with over a thousand fans travelling from across Ireland and further afield.\n\nThere were cheers as Mr Higgins unveiled the statue, before a rush of fans eager to see it up close and get their photo taken with it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThomas told those assembled that his family were devastated his mother Rose, who also died earlier this year, as well as his father were not there to see it.\n\n\"The main focus of my few words is to give thanks, and we have many people to thank for making this day possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This day is a very proud day for the McBride family, celebratory yet tinted with sadness, for they have departed, Mum and Dad.\n\n\"We are devastated that Mum and Dad aren\u0027t here today, I know they would have loved it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Thank you all.\"\n\nBig Tom and the Mainliners were formed in the 1960s and achieved widespread success.\n\nHenry McMahon, another member of the Mainliners, also described it as a day tinged with sadness.\n\n\"It\u0027s a wonderful day, tinged with sadness, but it\u0027s no less than Big Tom deserves, he was an icon, and still is an icon,\" he told the Press Association.\n\nUK-based sculptor Mark Richards said he had never seen a crowd like it, in the unveiling of all the pieces he has worked on.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained initially he had considered a sculpture of Big Tom on stage performing, but later decided on the sitting pose without the microphone in front of him, like a \"barrier\" between him and his fans.\n\nThat option was chosen by the family who felt it best reflected Tom\u0027s approachability and \"man of the people\" persona.\n\nAmong the fans in attendance were Richard and Marian Phillips from Co Kildare.\n\n\"I have been following Big Tom since 1971, he had a lovely manner, very natural, very down to earth, everyone was his friend,\" said Mr Phillips, who was wearing a Big Tom T-shirt.\n\nMyles Kavanagh had travelled from Kilkenny and dressed as Elvis for the occasion.\n\n\"It\u0027s magnicent, Big Tom would be proud of us all, Big Tom was the king of country, I may be the king of rock\u0027n\u0027roll but he was the king of country, we\u0027ll always have Big Tom in our memories,\" he said.\n\n\"He was so kind, he brought so much happiness to people with his music and he was a gentleman on and off the stage.\"\n\nThe unveiling came during the inaugural Castleblayney Celebrates Big Tom Festival, which opened on Culture Night and continued across the weekend.\n\nMcBride\u0027s career spanned more than five decades, culminating in his induction into the Irish Country Music Awards Hall of Fame in June 2016.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n
