First he filed chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming he \u0027couldn\u0027t afford\u0027 the $5million demo cost. That was dismissed.Then he filed an appeal against Judge Karlan\u0027s order to tear down the giant house. That too was denied.He went to California\u0027s Supreme Court to try to save his project. But the state\u0027s highest court torpedoed his efforts, refusing even to hear the case.Still undeterred, Hadid\u0027s lawyers filed a second appeal - this time against Judge Karlan\u0027s decision to appoint a receiver to oversee destruction of the house. He lost that appeal as well.Last month, Hadid\u0027s legal team filed a third appeal, this one against the $2.9 million judgment awarded to the neighbors by the civil trial jury."},{"url":null,"title":"Lets Joe Hunt generous six year old sent football teams star player 26p","story":"Share this articleCrowdfunding to fund Joe \u0026amp his family attend a Swindon Town game on JustGiving"},{"url":null,"title":"Paramount Plus offered British TV views streaming service launches Summer","story":"Share this articleThe company also announced that the third instalment of John Krasinski\u0027s A Quiet Place is scheduled for 2025, following the huge success of the sequel in 2021, which was instrumental in encouraging people back to cinemas after long Covid closures.The film is likely to see Krasinski\u0027s wife Emily Blunt reprise her role as a mother desperate to protect her family as blind creatures with extremely sensitive hearing run rampage.The US version of the service is already home to Yellowstone spin-off 1883, starring Tim McGraw and Faith Hill, and upcoming series The Offer, about the making of The Godfather, starring Miles Teller, Juno Temple, Matthew Goode and Giovanni Ribisi.Among a raft of announcements of new series is new Star Trek show Strange New Worlds, starring Anson Mount as Captain Pike Rabbit Hole, a psychological thriller starring Kiefer Sutherland and an update to Fatal Attraction starring Lizzy Caplan and Joshua Jackson.The company also announced Grease: Rise Of The Pink Ladies, a musical prequel to the classic film, updated with new music and choreography.It will also premiere a new Beavis and Butt-Head movie, followed by new episodes of the animated series, while South Park will premiere two events on Paramount+ each year for the next six years and all episodes will be exclusive to the service internationally this year and in the US in 2025.The service says it already has more than 50 new international original shows planned as it expands into global markets.The news comes as part of a range of announcements by ViacomCBS following an investor day meeting on Tuesday.ViacomCBS will be rebranded to become Paramount, the company said.Other American streaming platforms like Hulu are not available in the UK, while HBO Max has given its rights to Sky Atlantic. "},{"url":null,"title":"Bristol bar branded Britains right pub refusing serve unethical major brands","story":"Share this article Lemmy added: \u0027A lot of the reasons we\u0027ve taken s*** before in what we choose to stock and what not to is because of land use, water use, worker\u0027s rights - to name just a few.\u0027We don\u0027t serve Coca-Cola because they have a history of seriously bad use of water in third world countries, that not a lot of people know about.

heavily linked to long Covid. Official estimates show around 1.3million Britons, 2.1 per cent of the population, have long Covid-like symptoms that last at least four weeks after infection. But because the condition is hard to define and figures are based on self-reported symptoms, it is hard to know exactly how many people are affected by the condition.Fatigue, shortness of breath and loss of smell or taste are the most common ongoing symptoms.To examine the role of the vagus nerve — roughly 3mm in diameter — in long Covid, medics at University Hospital Germans in Badalona recruited 348 sufferers.Two-thirds of the group had symptoms similar to those who had damaged the nerve — which usually occurs through surgery, physical injury or a tumour. These included diarrhoea, an elevated heart rate, dizziness, difficulty swallowing, voice problems and low blood pressure.Further tests of 22 patients also showed that slightly more than a quarter had a thickened or inflamed vagus nerve. Almost all of them, however, suffered symptoms relating to vagus nerve dysfunction, including diarrhoea, an elevated heart rate and dizziness. Dr Gemma Lladós and Dr Lourdes Mateu, medics at hospital and authors of the study, said the results show most long Covid patients with symptoms of vagus nerve damage had changes in the structure or function of their nerve. \u0027Our findings so far thus point at vagus nerve dysfunction as a central pathophysiological feature of long Covid,\u0027 they added.The findings were presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. Dr David Strain, a senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School who was not involved in the study, said it adds to growing evidence that at least some long Covid symptoms are \u0027mediated through a direct impact on the nervous system\u0027.He said: \u0027It is entirely possible that people susceptible to nerve damage are at the greatest risk of developing long Covid. \u0027In this case this observation tells us little more than nerve damage is a result of Covid, this is greater in those with long Covid and the damage is easy to detect in a long, complex nerve.\u0027 But Dr Strain noted that not all persistent symptoms post-infection will be linked with this nerve, so more investigation is needed into the triggers of brain fog and muscle aches. He said drugs used to treat vagus nerve damage could be considered for long Covid."},{"url":null,"title":"England offer Covid jabs 5s Vaccines rolled non urgent basis","story":"Share this article Healthy children face a vanishingly low risk of severe illness from the virus, with only six children dying of the virus in England\u0027s first year of the pandemic. And two doses of a jab offers as little as 10 per cent protection against catching the antibody-resistant Omicron variant, UK data suggests.Many scientists have questioned the need to vaccinate children when so many have already had Covid.The Office of National Statistics estimates nearly three-quarters of youngsters aged 8 to 11 had Covid antibodies as of January 10. Normally the JCVI\u0027s recommendations are accepted by the Department of Health and implemented within a matter of days.But there are reports that No10 stepped in and blocked its publication last week so it could \u0027review\u0027 the advice.It is unclear what exactly caused the hold up, but in the past ministers have expressed frustration at the JCVI\u0027s caution over jabbing children.The group initially dragged its heels on recommending jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds in September, citing a lack of safety data and concerns about side-effects. In the end ministers had to circumvent the JCVI, and relied on Professor Chris Whitty and the chief medical officers in the devolved nations to approve the jabs on the basis they would prevent further disruption to schooling. There is a suggestion the Government wanted to announce the roll out to five to 11-year-olds as part of Boris Johnson\u0027s plan for England to live with Covid like flu.That strategy is set to be unveiled in Parliament after the recess on February 21 and include radical plans to ditch even the most fundamental Covid rules.Vaccination rates for children are similarly low in the US, where just three in 10 five to 11-year-olds have received one Covid jab and two in 10 are double-jabbed, according to data from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Children are given two Pfizer injections — which are a third of the dose given to adults — three weeks apart.Vaccine uptake is highest among white and mixed-race youngsters and lowest among black children. And children from the richest families are nearly three times more likely to be vaccinated (28.2 per cent) compared to those from the poorest areas (10.7 per cent).CDC data shows 17 per cent of children aged five to 11 rushed forward for their first jab in the month after the US approved the vaccine for the age group on November 2.But since then, uptake has slumped, with only eight per cent of opting to get the jab in the following month.The CDC\u0027s website states children as young as six months could be eligible for a Covid vaccination \u0027soon\u0027, with the country\u0027s Food and Drug Administration due to make a decision by February 21.But the FDA last week warned its announcement on the rollout to babies and toddlers is at least two months away. It is waiting for an update on the efficacy of three doses in the age group from Pfizer before it makes a decision. "},{"url":null,"title":"caution urged over relaxation of covid restrictions in schools","story":"The Teachers’ Union of Ireland warned that a sudden relaxation of measures could disrupt preparation for the Junior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams. Photograph: iStockTeaching unions and school managers are urging a cautious and gradual relaxation of Covid-19 rules.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is expected to recommend the easing of public health rules relating to the mandatory wearing of face masks and physical distancing in schools when it meets on Thursday.It will also consider giving the green light for the resumption of activities such as school concerts, plays, choirs and in-person parent-teacher meetings.Minister for Education Norma Foley said on Wednesday that public health advice had served schools well during the pandemic and that whatever changes are recommended would be implemented in the education system.She said she anticipated that Nphet advice around hand hygiene and the need for symptomatic staff or pupils to stay at home, as well as enhanced cleaning, would likely remain in place .However, staff representatives say the volume of Covid-19 in schools remains a challenge and is resulting in high levels of pupil and teacher absences.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) called for a “pragmatic and cautious” approach to any changes to Covid-19 mitigation measures in schools.‘Assurances’“We have sought assurances that infection prevention and control measures would remain in place in both primary and special schools for the 28 school days between the mid-term break and the Easter holidays, at the very least,” a spokesman said. “We have also set out our concern at the challenging situation in schools in recent weeks, despite these measures still being in place.”The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) also urged caution and warned that a sudden relaxation of measures could disrupt preparation for the Junior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams. TUI general secretary Michael Gillespie said thousands of exam-year students are facing into oral, practical and project work deadlines over the coming weeks.“If we stop everything all of a sudden, there is a risk that we’ll have lots of students and teachers missing. We’re urging a cautious approach,” he said.“We’re not calling for masks to be retained, necessarily, but we know that the measures we’ve had in place have managed to keep the number of cases below those in the wider community.”The two main school principals’ representative groups said they will be guided by whatever public health measures are announced.‘Follow the science’Páiric Clerkin of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network (IPPN) said: “Public health advice has guided us in the past and it’s important that we follow the science and do whatever is needed to keep children and staff as safe as possible.”Paul Crone of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals added that school leaders will implement whatever changes are recommended.Some inidual principals, meanwhile, said they look forward to a full resumption of school activities.Matt Melvin, principal of St Etchen’s National School in Kinnegad, Co Westmeath, said: “It will be fantastic to get back to sport, drama, art and music. It is so much part of the wider cultural and co-curricular experience . . . whatever happens, I hope that decisions are made on the basis of a public health rationale, rather than any political or social imperative.”Mark Boobbyer, warden of St Columba’s College in Dublin, said: “Personally, I’d be very happy to get rid of the restrictions. We haven’t been able to have whole-school assemblies for two years.“I worry that the restrictions have led to a fracturing of community.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireA status yellow wind warning associated with Storm Dudley came into place for the entire country from noon on Wednesday, until 11.30pm on Wednesday night. During this period westerly winds were expected to reach average speeds of between 50 and 65kmh, with damaging gusts of between 80 and 110kmh.The winds are expected to be stronger on exposed coasts and on high ground, while a combination of high tide and strong winds will lead to the possibility of flooding on Atlantic coasts. Power outages have already been reported across the country. In an update to the situation on Wednesday afternoon, Met Éireann said Storm Dudley was already making its presence felt, with Donegal County Council warning of dangerous conditions at sea. High winds are already being experienced in most coastal areas with the public advised to stay away from coastal promenades and seashores. Met Éireann hydrometeorologist Jennifer Canavan said Ireland was “in a period of high tides at the moment and this in combination with strong winds and stormy conditions means there is a high risk of large coastal waves and coastal flooding on Friday, especially along southern and eastern coasts.“As such we’re urging people to take extreme care near coastal areas and paths.”A status yellow marine gale warning is in place for all coasts of Ireland and on the Irish Sea until noon on Thursday, with winds expected to reach gale force 8 or strong gale force 9.Storm EuniceMet Éireann said a blustery day will follow on Thursday with a mix of bright spells and some heavy showers, before cloud, rain and strengthening winds arrive ahead of the second storm, Storm Eunice. Met Éireann meteorologist Matthew Martin said the national forecaster expected Storm Eunice to bring further challenging conditions, “especially on Friday morning as strong winds, heavy rain and snow moves across the country”. “At the moment it looks like northern and western areas are most likely to see the heaviest snow falls, with southern areas expected to see the strongest winds, however we’re still a few days ahead and the details of when and where are likely to change,” he said. “With this in mind, we’re urging people to keep a very close eye on the forecast and warnings for their area as these may change in the coming days.”The UK Met Office also issued a status orange wind warning for Antrim and Derry from 2pm on Wednesday until midnight, which it said will bring a period of very strong and disruptive winds.A yellow wind warning is in place meanwhile for Antrim, Armagh, Down, Fermanagh, Derry and Tyrone from 1pm on Wednesday until 6am on Thursday.Gerry Murphy, a forecaster with Met Éireann, said earlier on Wednesday that there was a risk of power cuts later in the day as a result of Storm Dudley.Friday warningsA yellow snow, wind and rain warning is in place for Ireland from 1am on Friday until 3pm that day, with “very strong winds and falls of heavy rain, sleet and snow” expected during this time, Met Éireann said.“Some disruption is likely along with a possibility of coastal and spot flooding,” it added.A status orange wind warning has also been issued for Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, and Wexford from 5am on Friday to 11am that morning. Met Éireann said that as a result of Storm Eunice these areas could see severe and potentially damaging winds during the period of the orange warning, gusting up to 130kmh, higher in exposed areas.Warnings will be further updated on Thursday morning.Storm Eunice should clear by Friday afternoon when it will move to the west coast of England, where it is likely to cause severe disruption.Once Storm Eunice clears, there would still be cold weather with showers of hail, sleet and snow.The weather will remain unsettled overnight on Thursday, as Storm Eunice begins to track eastwards over Ireland through Thursday night and Friday. Met Éireann have said the weather will be “very unsettled for the week”.An orange marine gale and storm force warning is in place for all Irish coastal waters and on the Irish Sea on Friday, with cyclonic winds forecast to reach gale or strong gale force, and reaching storm force 10 or higher at times.That warning is in place from just after midnight on Friday morning until 9pm that night. UtilitiesMeanwhile, Gas Networks Ireland said it does not anticipate any disruption to gas supplies during this week’s forecasted storms.“Ireland’s gas network is one of the safest and most modern gas networks in the world and with the added security of its 14,617km of pipeline being underground it is unlikely to be impacted by adverse weather conditions,” it said.“All works are currently scheduled to take place as normal, however as the safety of our staff, customers and the public is paramount, our teams will assess conditions locally and may defer some work if required for safety reasons.”The utility’s emergency services will continue to operate as normal, regardless of what alert is in place, it added.The Government committee that co-ordinates responses to emergencies met on Tuesday to prepare for the storms. The team held a second virtual meeting on Wednesday with Met Éireann, the OPW, local authorities, response agencies, and key Government departments in preparation for Storm Dudley and Storm Eunice. The team will continue to liaise with Met Éireann to monitor the evolving weather patterns and intends to conduct a further meeting at noon on Thursday.In a statement on Wednesday evening it said that only necessary travel should be undertaken during periods of orange weather warnings.Around the country precautionary measures are being taken in case of flooding. Waterford City and County Council has said flood barriers for the City and Passage may be deployed on Thursday afternoon and the situation is being actively monitored.

A sailor with no facial features. A courtier with one red leg and one white.Nightmarish as these tableaux might sound, they derive not from a horror film but from the Bayeux Tapestry. Long regarded as one of the most important records of English history, the tapestry turns out to be riddled with errors.And these errors go beyond the famously ambiguous death of King Harold, who might be the soldier struck in the eye by an arrow, but who might also be the inidual slashed by a cavalryman’s sword and trampled underfoot.Mia Hansson, an amateur embroiderer from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, is six years into her project of making a full-size replica of the tapestry. The original, of course, is 230ft in length and tells the story of the Norman conquest of England, culminating in the Battle of Hastings and – spoiler alert – the victory of William the Conqueror.Thought to date to the 11th century, the tapestry has previously been hailed as “one of the supreme achievements of the Norman Romanesque” by Sylvette Lemagnen, author of the 2005 book La Tapisserie de Bayeux. Its status assured, Lemagnen says, by its “exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit.”Perhaps it is time to dock a few marks from this mainstay of British history teaching. Over the six years in which she has been painstakingly copying the tapestry, Ms Hansson has identified at least 15 mistakes in the original.They begin with the sailor, who has a rope running across the void where his face should be. They continue with a mounted soldier whose chainmail is rounded in the portion above his waist and square beneath it – a discrepancy that Ms Hansson ascribes to the tapestry being embroidered by two people at once. The errors continue with the men carrying the coffin of Edward the Confessor – look closely and you will see that there aren’t enough legs to go round.Given that Ms Hansson still has roughly another six years’ worth of work to go, we can safely forecast that more errors will emerge.But she is not amending them, despite her professional instinct – Ms Hansson, 47, is a trained primary school teacher – to correct. She is reproducing the tapestry, she says, “as faithfully as I can, because they did an enormous job. This is a masterpiece, this embroidery, and who am I to come and correct what they’ve done? I’m trying to honour it, warts and all.”That said, the errors can be frustrating. “This is going to turn my hair grey,” she said. “I’m working on a piece now where the back leg of a horse is just simply wrong.“There’s everything wrong about it and I have to copy that and it’s doing my head in.”Ms Hansson has also turned the tapestry into a colouring book. She will display the unfinished replica tapestry at St Peter’s Church Hall in Wisbech on April 12.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow creating \u0026#39new normal\u0026#39 to contest sovereignty in Europe, says NatoInvestment visas for dodgy Russian businessmen to be scrapped under Home Office plansTeam York: Who’s still backing Prince Andrew and can they save him?Ursula von der Leyen under pressure to freeze EU cash to Poland and HungaryOrgan transplants one step closer to ‘Holy Grail’ as scientists convert blood types in world firstStorm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine children five 11 year olds england offered jabs","story":"Covid vaccines are to be offered to six million children aged five to 11 from April – but ministers have said the decision is up to parents.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on Wednesday confirmed it had given the green light to the rollout of jabs for young children. It will begin in April, with children offered two jabs 12 weeks apart on a non-urgent basis.Last week The  revealed that the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had drawn up the advice, which ministers have been considering.On Tuesday, Wales became the first country in the UK to announce that it would be offering a Covid vaccine to all five to 11-year-olds, with Scotland, England and Northern Ireland following suit on Wednesday.The JCVI advice follows months of debate between scientists about whether to back the rollout of jabs for the age group. It said children should be offered vaccines to protect against severe Covid in advance of a potential new wave.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said the rollout would be non-urgent. The programme is planned for the spring and summer, with jabs likely to be administered in school holidays. Ministers were at pains to stress that it is up to parents to decide whether the benefits for five to 11-year-olds are worth vaccination. Around 85 per cent of  children are estimated to have already been infected with Covid.Scientists warned that parents should not wait until any future wave has begun spreading before getting their children vaccinated. But they said the programme should not displace that of other childhood vaccinations, including MMR and HPV to protect against cervical cancer, which have been set back by the pandemic.The NHS has also been told that the continued rollout of jabs and boosters to adults and vulnerable young people is a greater priority. Mr Javid said on Wednesday that the NHS will prepare to extend this non-urgent offer to all children during April so parents can, if they want, take up the offer to increase protection against potential future waves of Covid-19 as we learn to live with this virus.Later, he told reporters: First of all, the vaccine is safe and effective. Second of all, this is a non-urgent offer. It is something that\u0027s there as an option for parents, and they should decide for themselves whether it\u0027s an offer that they want to take up, and all the information they need would be made available for them.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the UK medical regulator, approved the Pfizer vaccine for use in five to 11-year-olds last year.The paediatric dose is one third of the strength of an adult dose after research showed that the immune response from a lower dose in those aged five to 11 was just as good as a full dose for 16 to 25-year-olds.Last week, scientists said the UK was past the point at which vaccinating young and healthy children against the virus would make much difference.But families planning holidays have complained that the lack of jabs for under-12s has left them facing logistical headaches. The majority of countries in Europe are now introducing jabs for under-12s, and some holiday resorts have banned those who are unvaccinated.The JCVI has been ided about the matter for months, with arguments over whether the benefits of Covid jabs are sufficient to support their use in young children.The committee said: Although this age group is generally at very low risk of serious illness from the virus, a very small number of children who get infected do develop severe disease.Latest evidence suggests that offering the vaccine ahead of another potential wave will protect this very small number of children from serious illness and hospitalisation, and will also provide some short-term protection against mild infection across the age group.Prof Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI chairman of Covid-19 immunisation, said: The committee has carefully considered the potential direct health impacts of vaccination and potential indirect educational impacts.The main purpose of offering vaccination to five to 11-year-olds is to increase their protection against severe illness in advance of a potential future wave of Covid.JCVI member Prof Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: The risks posed by Covid in this age group are low – but they exist, and parents may wish to reduce them by having their children immunised.Common side-effects such as fever, headaches and malaise do occur in some children following this vaccine but do not last more than a day or two in most cases. Nevertheless, they may result in some school absence.More serious side effects are reported in this age group but are extremely rare and are minimised by using a lower vaccine dose than in adults and a wide 12-week interval between the two doses.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the advice but said headteachers would have liked to have seen a little more urgency, given the extent of the current disruption to the education of children in this age range More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow creating \u0026#39new normal\u0026#39 to contest sovereignty in Europe, says NatoInvestment visas for dodgy Russian businessmen to be scrapped under Home Office plansTeam York: Who’s still backing Prince Andrew and can they save him?Ursula von der Leyen under pressure to freeze EU cash to Poland and HungaryOrgan transplants one step closer to ‘Holy Grail’ as scientists convert blood types in world firstStorm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hms queen elizabeth inside aircraft carrier royal navy flagship","story":"The yellow-helmeted flight deck officer leans into a 40-knot wind and raises a small green flag in his right hand. I crouch behind him, clutching my robust but battered high-def camera. A few feet away, a snarling F-35B Lightning Stealth Fighter, sleek as a shark and every bit as lethal, prepares to launch into the steel-grey skies of the eastern Mediterranean.On the bridge, the navigators steer directly into the wind. ‘Steady on designated flying course, one-one-zero,’ says the officer of the watch.  ‘Steady on one-one-zero, sir,’ confirms the helmsman.The F-35B needs plenty of headwind to get airborne. The aircraft has a run-up of only 350 feet to the curved ‘ski-jump’, from which it will make its final leap skywards. Inside the glass-encased flight control tower behind us, the vessel’s Commander Air, Ed Phillips, aka ‘Wings’, looks up and down the massive flight deck and, when satisfied all is clear, gives a short sharp order:All eyes turn to the green flag held aloft and rippling in the wind. Probably worth no more than a couple of quid, it is brought down to the ground with a dramatic flourish the signal for the F-35B, worth well over £100 million, to get airborne.I brace myself for the immense power about to be unleashed. I’ve witnessed this many times and know what to expect. It’ll be exhilarating, for sure, but also terrifying and probably painful. I’m determined to capture on film a spectacular close-up of a launch as near to the aircraft as possible, but the timing is critical and so far I’ve manifestly failed to pull it off.The searing blast from the rear jet nozzle has always blown me off my feet and sent me sprawling. I have the bruises and cuts to show for it and God knows how much skin I’ve now invested in the roughened, diamond-hard surface of the flight deck. But I still don’t have the footage I want. This time, two hefty sailors are ready to hold me down, or at least try to. My fear is that no amount of muscle power will be a match for the explosive thrust of what is essentially a horizontal rocket.The pilot releases the brakes and opens the throttle. The Pratt \u0026amp Whitney afterburning, turbofan engine raises its pitch to a terrifying scream as the aircraft surges forward. I clench my teeth, tense my muscles and, with my heart pounding in my ears, bear hug the camera in a semi-stable position. But how long can I hold on? Four vice-like hands press down on my hunched shoulders.It’s June 2021 and I’ve joined the ship’s company of HMS Queen Elizabeth for her first operational deployment. We are some weeks into a seven-month voyage to the South China Sea, not on exercise but, locked, loaded and ready for action, should it become necessary.The new carrier and fleet flagship, together with eight escorts (destroyers, frigates, supply ships and a submarine) comprise Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21) – the most powerful naval force to leave the UK in a generation. Prior to our transit through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, on our way to the Pacific and the disputed waters of the South China Sea, the ship has been launching waves of jets on Operation Shader – in support of land forces in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. But this has prompted a reaction from the Russians. They consider this part of the Med their own backyard and are intent on letting the QE and her escorts know they’re not welcome here. But the QE is the new dog on the block and she’s here to mark her own territory, not with a wag of the tail but a snarl.Today’s launch of the F-35s, therefore, is not to attack IS but to ward off Russian warplanes attempting to overfly us. Pilots, drawn from the Fleet Air Arm, RAF and US Marine Corps, have been scrambling all day, sometimes in rapid two-minute intervals, to intercept ‘red bandits’ and escort them away at a safe range.The Russians, apart from wanting to goad the Royal Navy, are desperate to get a closer look at the QE, the most advanced aircraft carrier in the world, and also test the Task Group’s reaction procedures – not only in the air but also on the surface, with their warships, and underwater with their submarines. The QE’s Anti-Submarine Warfare Merlin Mk2 helicopters from 820 Naval Air Squadron are on constant patrol in order to monitor subsurface incursions and react accordingly. Nobody has actually opened fire, but there’s a lot of posturing and tactical lip-curling. If this is the start of a new Cold War, nobody is in doubt that things could heat up very quickly. The QE’s magazines are bursting with bombs, bullets and missiles of all descriptions and capabilities, as you’d expect on a warship that is now Britain’s main conventional strategic deterrent.Commodore Steve Moorhouse, leading CSG21, knows that Britain’s potential adversaries, the Russians and Chinese, will prod and poke his Task Group at every opportunity. ‘They want to see what we’re made of,’ he freely admits. ‘And I’m happy to show them, but professionally, in a spirit of confidence, not confrontation.’ Moorhouse is a steely commander but also a diplomat by default. After all, HMS Queen Elizabeth, a chunk of British sovereign territory, is part warship, part floating embassy. As the embodiment of ‘Global Britain’, her charge is to deliver ‘power projection’ on behalf of the nation: on the one hand that means hard-edged, lethal warfare on the other it’s about soft, political persuasion through deterrence, as well as overt support for allies around the world.Friends and foes alike will be watching this deployment with keen interest and I’m here to capture it on film for a forthcoming BBC TV series. But this isn’t the first time I’ve filmed HMS Queen Elizabeth. That was back in 2009, when I witnessed Princess Anne cutting the ship’s first steel at Govan shipyard in Glasgow. This was not so much the birth of Britain’s biggest-ever warship – more like her conception – and I was struck by the enormity of the occasion.  Sir Jonathon Band, the First Sea Lord at the time, spoke with passion to the audience and assembled media. The Queen Elizabeth Class of aircraft carrier, comprising HMS Queen Elizabeth, with HMS Prince of Wales to follow, would, he explained, ‘provide Britain with the means to deliver air power from the sea, wherever and whenever required, and in a stronger and more decisive form than ever before’. They will also, he added, ‘be the centrepiece of Britain’s military capability for many years to come’.The construction of HMS Queen Elizabeth and her sister ship meant a complete reinvention of the Royal Navy but, despite Sir Jonathon’s upbeat messaging, it was to prove a painful and long-drawn-out process. Our active carriers at the time, Ark Royal, Illustrious and Invincible, were about to be axed in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review and with them the Navy’s Harrier squadron – its entire naval fixed-wing capability. Already, naysayers and vocal critics were provoking a heated debate over the pros and cons of a carrier-centric Navy, and whether there’d be enough escort ships to protect the carriers while at sea or sufficient sailors to man them – each would be three times the size of the Invincible Class carriers.General Sir Peter Wall, former head of the British Army, described the decision to build the new carriers as no more than a ‘vanity project’ that ‘lacked credibility’ and which could be seen to have ‘skewed the UK’s conventional defence effort to a damaging degree’. Max Hastings, ever the provocateur, suggested the new warships represented delusions of grandeur for a Navy in decline. Other denigrators were quick to point out that a large carrier is a big target – especially for the new generation of hypersonic missiles that the Chinese call ‘carrier killers’.Russia inevitably chimed in with some of its own political trash talk: ‘Just make sure you keep your new carrier away from Moscow’s warships or they’ll send it to the bottom of the sea.’Military hardware is an emotive subject, especially in the context of huge capital expenditure that might otherwise be spent on housing, welfare or the NHS, but £6 billion for two vessels (albeit a near doubling of the original budget) is modest compared to the eye-watering price tag of USS Gerald R. Ford, an American super-carrier of similar proportions which cost more than $13 billion (and which, according to the Pentagon, ‘has yet to demonstrate it can effectively defend itself from anti-ship missiles and other threats’).The glossy brochure issued by a conglomerate of shipbuilders known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance certainly suggested that Britain was getting its money’s worth. At 65,000 tonnes, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales would not only be the biggest warships ever built for the Royal Navy, but also the most powerful and advanced in terms of military technology and stealth capabilities – especially when married eventually to the state-of-the-art F-35B Lightning jet fighter.The sales pitch for the super-carriers came with a staggering array of facts and figures. The ships, it claimed, would be so highly automated they’d require only ‘lean-manned’ crews – less than 1,000 per ship, without aircrew. That’s broadly one fifth the size of an American crew on a similar-sized ship. They’d each have a four-acre flight deck, the size of three and a half football fields, nine decks and a hangar big enough to fit two Type 23 frigates side by side. Each carrier would have two propellers weighing 33 tonnes – exerting the same thrust as 50 high-speed trains and producing a maximum speed in excess of 27 knots (31mph). The six engines (two mighty gas turbines and four diesels) would produce enough energy to power a city the size of Swindon the electrical cabling and wiring would stretch six times round the world the ship, weighing the same as 35,000 family cars, would carry enough fuel to take those cars to the moon and back a dozen times… and on it went.The statistics were mind-boggling, but one thing was for sure: the challenge of building the first of these ships – the nine-decked HMS Queen Elizabeth – manning her, taking her to sea and getting her battle-ready was going to be a compelling story, as I learnt while following her construction in seven shipyards around the UK, culminating in her final assembly at Rosyth in Fife, like some gargantuan Lego toy. But, engineering aside, I knew that her real story would reside in the sailors yet to arrive the men and women who would breathe life into the country’s first super-carrier.  Foremost among them was Jerry Kyd, the ship’s first seagoing captain. I encountered him on the day he arrived in Rosyth in May 2016, as he addressed a fledgling ship’s company of just 456 sailors standing in front of their ship, still an inert hulk without propellers and dead in the water.‘The world’s a frisky place at the moment,’ he said. ‘And we have to be ready to respond to threats which I think are coming sooner rather than later.’ Kyd glanced towards their future home, encased in scaffolding. ‘HMS Queen Elizabeth, as big and sophisticated as she might be, is really just a huge metal box, full of pipes, wires, gadgetry and computer terminals. She’s missing one vital ingredient…’ He paused dramatically. ‘Without the flesh, blood, muscle and hearts of you, my sailors, that ship is just a robot. You, not the ship, are the most important resource at my disposal.’It was nearly a year before the QE was ready for her first sea trials. As a ‘new build’, there were bound to be problems. On the eve of our departure for the North Sea, Captain Kyd warned that there would be emergencies: ‘We’ll have floods, we’ll have fires. And casualties too. That’s the nature of this business.’For the best part of two months the ship was put through her paces off the coast of Scotland, where I joined them. The first aircraft, a Merlin helicopter, was landed on the flight deck within four days as the ship’s company got used to their largely subterranean existence deep in the belly of the beast. I watched with amazement as the sailors, many of them straight out of training, transformed the massive grey hulk not only into a working warship but a home from home. The QE was fast becoming a vibrant floating city and, with 23 nations represented from across the Commonwealth, all human life was here. My first challenge, however, was to learn my way round a ship longer than the Houses of Parliament and taller than Nelson’s Column and so gigantic that it boasted five kilometres of passageways and 3,200 compartments.Apart from a serious issue with a cracked thrust block that held one of the drive shafts in place, all went as well as could be expected. As Jerry Kyd foretold, there were plenty of fires and floods as the ship was pushed to breaking point so that her technical and seagoing limits could be identified. There were ‘casualties’ too, but thankfully only minor ones – the worst being cracked teeth and broken fingers. Sea trials completed, we finally entered Portsmouth dockyard, the ship’s designated home port, and within months the QE was officially commissioned by the Queen.After a period of maintenance, the ship set off for the next vital stage of her trials off the eastern seaboard of the US. Within hours of leaving Portsmouth we became aware of an ominous presence – a Russian Federation frigate called Admiral Makarov had closed to within two miles of our position. A highly capable warship armed with Kalibr long-range cruise missiles, the Makarov was in transit from the Baltic to Sevastopol on the Black Sea. While officially permitted to route through the English Channel she had clearly erted her course to have a closer look at our ship.  A few days later, just before starting our transatlantic crossing, we were suddenly erted into the Irish Sea to help chase off a Russian submarine spotted in British territorial waters. There was an increasing concern, as there still is, that Russians could be sussing out British underwater power and communication cabling – an obvious target for a potential enemy.  The Russian sub made a run for it as soon as we got close. Even before the QE had become operational the writing was on the wall and it was written very clearly in Cyrillic script. A sign of things to come (and indeed I write this as the world tries to second-guess Russian designs on Ukraine).Following this brief ersion we progressed across the Atlantic and the next dramatic event I witnessed was the ship’s first-ever run ashore in a foreign port, which didn’t go entirely to plan. In Mayport, Florida, after a night of heavy drinking, four sailors from the QE and two from our escort frigate, HMS Monmouth, were arrested for a range of alcohol-related offences including jaywalking, fighting and resisting arrest. Despite making headlines on both sides of the Atlantic, the episode was soon forgotten and at least part of the blame was attached to overzealous policing.  Captain Kyd, a pragmatist, reckoned that a night in jail was punishment enough for sailors letting off steam. ‘The question we have to ask ourselves,’ Kyd told his commanders, ‘is what sort of sailor would we want to go to war with? The automaton who obeys every rule, plays it safe and never takes chances? Or the free spirit who pushes his luck and breaks the odd rule?’    Kyd quickly refocused on the job in hand – namely to see an F-35B Lightning jet land on the ship’s flight deck for the first time. Helicopters were one thing, but a fighter jet that lands vertically using immense downward thrust from its enormous engine was quite another. Commander Nathan Gray, the Navy’s top test pilot, was the first to attempt a landing. It went without a hitch, although many questions remained about safety margins before the flight deck and aircraft could be handed over to front-line combat pilots. Two months of continuous, painstaking testing in all weathers, including a full-blown hurricane, gradually provided the answers. Gray, despite a few near misses, was satisfied that he and his colleagues had done all they could to ready the ship and aircraft for action.  And so to the present. Here I am aboard the QE once again – no longer on sea trials, but busy arm-wrestling the Russians, and before long she’ll be playing cat-and-mouse with the Chinese in the South China Sea. This is the acid test, with much at stake. The Prime Minister has declared he wants the Royal Navy to be the most powerful and influential in Europe by the end of the decade. CSG21 is the first step to achieving that ambition and proving that the new aircraft carrier is no white elephant but an effective instrument of government as well as an iconic symbol of nation.  Great adventure beckons and, once again, all life is here – a much expanded ship’s company of 1,650 men and women. Yes, there are the aviators yes, there are the seafarers yes, there are the marine engineers. But there are so many others: stewards, chefs, medics, gunners, aircraft handlers, writers, warfare specialists, physical trainers and intelligence officers. There is even a specialist chocolatier and, maybe because of him, a dedicated dentist and dental hygienist.‘Bleeding frozen chips!’ shouts Ronnie Lambert, an Essex boy, born and bred. ‘They want 10 more boxes in the main galley and they’re all at the back of the frickin’ fridge.’‘Well, get in there and pull ’em out,’ laughs fellow storeman Aaron Mackin. ‘It’s yer bleedin’ job.’‘Well, I’m transferring to aviation! Them boys have it easy up there. All sunshine and sea.’    The F-35B, accelerating from a standing start, rattles my bones. The heavyset sailors push down hard on my prone body as I attempt to point the camera in the right direction. The sailors are now lying on top of me – the jet stream strikes and skittles us. I roll across the deck, trying to protect my camera. Did I capture the moment of take off? I will check as soon as I can. Lying on my back I look up to see five British F-35s close in on three Russian MiGs.There will be more Russian warplanes soon. They’ll keep coming, but at least we know one thing: we have chips to go with our fish tonight. Must be a Friday.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow creating \u0026#39new normal\u0026#39 to contest sovereignty in Europe, says NatoInvestment visas for dodgy Russian businessmen to be scrapped under Home Office plansTeam York: Who’s still backing Prince Andrew and can they save him?Ursula von der Leyen under pressure to freeze EU cash to Poland and HungaryOrgan transplants one step closer to ‘Holy Grail’ as scientists convert blood types in world firstStorm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"met launches cash for honours investigation prince charless","story":"Prince Charles has said he is willing to speak to detectives after Scotland Yard announced it had launched a criminal investigation into an alleged cash for honours scandal involving one of his closest confidants.The politan Police is examining claims that Michael Fawcett, his former right-hand man, had worked with fixers to secure a CBE for the Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, who had given more than £1.5 million to the Prince’s Foundation charity.The Prince of Wales, who presented Mr Mahfouz with the honorary title at a private ceremony at Buckingham Palace in 2016, has denied any knowledge of the alleged deal.Royal sources have said Prince Charles is willing to speak to police in order to help with the investigation.“There has been no request for help from the police so far, but if he is asked to help he will of course do so,” the source said. A Clarence House spokesman said: “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities.”Scotland Yard confirmed it had launched a criminal investigation into the allegations, which first appeared in the media last year.The Prince\u0027s Foundation is an educational charity established in 1986 which brings together a number of projects and causes that Prince Charles is passionate about.The allegations centered around claims that Mr Mahfouz, who denies any wrongdoing, donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Prince Charles.Mr Fawcett - who has been a close aide to the Prince for more than 40-years - resigned as the chief executive of the Prince’s Foundation charity in the wake of the allegations.Detectives liaised with the officials from the Prince’s Foundation after Norman Baker, the former Liberal Democrat MP, made a formal complaint to Scotland Yard.In December, the Prince’s Foundation published the findings of its own investigation into the allegations, which stated there was some evidence of communication between the CEO and fixers regarding honorary nominations for a donor between 2014-18.But the report stated it had found no evidence that the charity’s trustees were aware of this.The police investigation is being led by the Met\u0027s Special Enquiry Team, the same unit that is in charge of the Partygate investigation.A Scotland Yard spokesman said: The politan Police Service has launched an investigation into allegations of offences under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925.The decision follows an assessment of a September 2021 letter. This related to media reporting alleging offers of help were made to secure honours and citizenship for a Saudi national.The Special Enquiry Team has conducted the assessment process which has included contacting those believed to hold relevant information.Officers liaised with The Prince’s Foundation about the findings of an independent investigation into fundraising practices. The Foundation provided a number of relevant documents.These documents were reviewed alongside existing information. The assessment determined an investigation will commence.

She answered: “Yes.” And all hell broke loose. It was one thing for the independent nuclear deterrent to form the backbone of British and Nato defence policy, but quite another thing to actually state publicly that you would use it.May was right. What would be the point in possessing Trident at all if our political leaders stated publicly that it was only there for show, that in the case an enemy launched a first strike at us, we would defend ourselves with a few sturdy brollies and a whole dictionary of harsh language?Deterrence is about persuading the other side that in the event they chose to launch a nuclear attack at us or our allies, they should know that that would be the equivalent of signing their own, and their people’s, death warrant. That sounds harsh now that I’ve typed it, but there we are. Life is tough. And in a world in which nuclear weapons can’t be uninvented, it’s the best and only way of maintaining international peace.All of this sprang to mind when contemplating the current impasse on the border of Ukraine, where Russia may or may not perform an homage to Germany foreign policy in 1938. It’s arguably the most serious military dispute for the West since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, and certainly the worst since the end of the Cold War. However it’s resolved, we should at least be thankful that so far, no one is considering turning this territorial dispute nuclear. But the only reason that is unlikely is because Nato countries ignored the siren voices of the Left over decades and steadfastly held onto, and upgraded, their nuclear arsenals.Can anyone be in any doubt that, had CND and their fellow travellers successfully persuaded Britain’s leaders to ditch Polaris, Cruise and Trident, the world would be there for the taking by the likes of Putin? I used to ask former constituents who imagined the world would be a safer place without nuclear weapons how such a utopia could emerge. After all, the only countries where peace movements are allowed to press their case are modern liberal democracies how safe would the planet be if America and her allies rid themselves of nuclear weapons, leaving Russia, China and North Korea still in possession of theirs?Yet this is a scenario that is, if not actually embraced by modern day “peace” campaigners, then ignored altogether. Buy the world a Coke and we won’t have to think about all this uncomfortable business about facts and reality.The reason Jeremy Corbyn never made a serious attempt to change Labour’s pro-Trident defence policy while he was party leader was because he didn’t need to. Once prime minister, he could virtue signal his intention never to use them in any circumstance, making them obsolete in a single, publicly broadcast sentence.There were many who, as communism crumbled, subscribed to Francis Fukuyama’s optimistic view of the End of History and his predictions that the global triumph of economic liberalism would ultimately make nuclear weapons redundant. Alas, we remain a long way from that destination. Those who blithely claim that “the world has never been more dangerous” are, I think, wrong. There were points during the Cold War when the world really was on the brink of nuclear Armageddon, and no realistic scenario today can compete with those blood-curdling moments in the 60s, 70s and 80s when the world held its breath.But Putin’s nationalistic designs on neighbouring countries, China’s similar claims on Taiwan and North Korea’s unhinged and borderline psychopathic leadership show that we are a very long way from the point at which the ploughshare industry can expect a boost.The same old naivety that once drove thousands of CND supporters through the streets of London is well replicated in the Twitter accounts of corporate organisations hoping to increase their profit margins by signalling their woke credentials to their younger audiences. “You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war,” was the considered geopolitical and philosophical conclusion reached recently by the makers of Chocolate Fudge Brownie ice cream. Not only can you do both, but in this nuclear age there is no alternative to doing both. The absence of war – or at least the absence of nuclear war – since Hiroshima and Nagasaki is an inescapable and inconvenient fact. Peace has been established through a fear of retaliation, a fear of obliteration.This being earth, there are no comfortable assurances to reach about the military and political strategy of Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD): it may work indefinitely or it may not. But how can anyone doubt that the best way to bring about the apocalypse none of us wants to see is to give up our weapons and leave it to the dictatorships of the world to use them as and when they see fit?More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow creating \u0026#39new normal\u0026#39 to contest sovereignty in Europe, says NatoInvestment visas for dodgy Russian businessmen to be scrapped under Home Office plansTeam York: Who’s still backing Prince Andrew and can they save him?Ursula von der Leyen under pressure to freeze EU cash to Poland and HungaryOrgan transplants one step closer to ‘Holy Grail’ as scientists convert blood types in world firstStorm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"organ transplants one step closer holy grail scientists convert","story":"All organs may one day be suitable for all patients without the need to first find a blood type match, after a landmark discovery.More than 4,000 people in the UK are waiting for an organ transplant on the NHS, with the majority in need of kidneys which can come from living donors.However, around 1,000 patients need whole organs, such as hearts, lungs or pancreases, that must come from deceased patients.In these cases, doctors must find a suitable match where the donor and recipient are the same blood type because, otherwise, a clash will see the recipient’s immune system recognise the new organ as foreign and attack it.The only exception to this rule is if the donor is type O, as the organs of these people express no identifying features, stripped of any telltale protruding proteins.People who belong to blood group O are therefore known as “universal donors” and their organs can be given to anyone, irrespective of their blood group.And researchers from Canada have now managed, for the first time, to convert an organ from one blood group to another, turning a human lung from type A to O.This was achieved by keeping the pair of lungs healthy and functional in a specialist piece of equipment and then treating one of them with a cocktail of enzymes to strip away the type A identifiers, known as antigens. The other lung was left unchanged.Researchers then tested to see if the process had worked by exposing the lung to blood filled with antibodies that would attack a type A antigen. No rejection was seen, proving that the experiment was a success and they had engineered the world’s first universal organ process.The team treated eight blood type A lungs and discovered the treatment removed more than 97 per cent of blood type A antigens within four hours.One in three people in the UK are A+, and another third are O+. But just three per cent of people are AB. As a result of this natural variation, some people will wait longer for a life-saving transplant as a direct result of their blood group.Although O is common, because it is used as a universal donor, many of these organs end up going to non-O patients, which means that O patients actually end up waiting the longest.This also translates to a higher proportion of waiting list deaths in some groups, the experts say.“With the current matching system, wait times can be considerably longer for patients who need a transplant depending on their blood type,” said Dr Marcelo Cypel, surgical director of the Ajmera Transplant Centre in Toronto, Canada, and the senior author of the study.“Having universal organs means we could eliminate the blood-matching barrier and prioritise patients by medical urgency, saving more lives and wasting fewer organs.”“The treatment described here could … further expand the pool of universal donor organs from the current 55 per cent (blood group O donors) to over 80 per cent,” the researchers add in their study, published in Science Translational Medicine.“As a consequence, this strategy may greatly improve access and fairness of organ allocation.”Robin Vos, chair of the European Cardio Thoracic Transplant Association (ECTTA), told The : “Recent very important achievements in organ bioengineering, regeneration and transplantation highlight the importance of scientific research in the field of transplantation.“Achievement of an immunosuppression-free state has been pursued since the early days of transplant medicine and is considered by many as the Holy Grail for transplant sciences.“The current results, if proven stable, durable and reproducible, may indeed represent another important step towards this goal, universally benefitting all patients in need of an organ transplant.“Disruptive innovations, like the creation of universal blood-type organs, may shape future delivery of trusted transplant care and can truly be considered as landmarks in the history of transplant medicine.”There are various potential ways of resolving the organ shortage, and recent developments in xenotransplantation – using animal organs in people – suggest that this method may also be an option.Genetically-modified pigs provided a heart for a living American man, as well as a kidney that was transplanted into a braindead man, also from America.These successes could see animal organs become a conventional way to treat people with organ failure, but experts say there is no silver bullet and the best way to reduce deaths from organ failure is to encourage more people to become organ donors.NHS Blood and Transplant’s annual activity report shows that there were 26.7 million registered donors in England as of March 2021, up from 26 in March 2020 because of a legislative change to an “opt-out” registry.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow creating \u0026#39new normal\u0026#39 to contest sovereignty in Europe, says NatoInvestment visas for dodgy Russian businessmen to be scrapped under Home Office plansTeam York: Who’s still backing Prince Andrew and can they save him?Ursula von der Leyen under pressure to freeze EU cash to Poland and HungaryStorm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosCovid vaccine for children: Who is eligible and what are the side effects?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"secrets number 10 front door","story":"As with so much to do with 10 Downing Street right now, establishing the facts about its famous front door isn’t always as straightforward. A  reader wrote a Letter to the Editor this week, to correct no less an eminence than Sandi Toksvig on the question of why the zero on the threshold to the Prime Minister’s residence is skew-whiff.On the BBC’s brainbox television show, QI, Toksvig had explained that the 37-degree tilt to the left on the numeral ‘0’ in question “had always been” that way since what had hitherto been 5 Downing Street was redesignated 10 Downing Street in 1779.  But the letter’s author, Malvern Harper, who had trained as a sign writer in the 1960s, recalled that his tutor had told him the slant was because the number ‘0’ was actually a capitalised letter ‘O’ in the same unusual typography used on Emperor Trajan’s Column in Rome in AD113.Both explanations can be found in the many histories of Downing Street written since Sir Robert Walpole took up residence there in 1732 at the invitation of George II. And there is even a variation that suggests the official Department of Works, as a result of another round of austerity which coincided with the renovation of Numbers 10, 11 and 12 in the early 1960s, had simply run out of ‘0’s. In the spirit of make do and mend, they substituted a spare Trajan ‘O’ as the next best thing.Which account is right? Even as one who has experienced that frisson – as if a very small footnote in history – of stepping over the threshold, I’ve no idea. But I can report some other secrets that the Downing Street door hides in plain sight. The original six-panel Georgian door, made of black oak, was installed in 1772 when Lord North was Prime Minister, as part of extensive renovations that saw three Downing Street properties knocked into one of suitable grandeur. Its 1991 replacement is made of black gloss-finish steel, installed for added security after an IRA attack, when John Major was PM, saw a mortar land in Number 10’s back garden. (When it needs maintenance, it has an equally robust twin that holds the fort.)If you can see past the press pack regularly gathered outside, the eagle-eyed will notice that there is no lock in which to put a key, and no handle. This is a door than can only be opened from the inside, where – because the brass door bell to its right is for decorative purposes only – a security guard is on duty 247, watching security cameras so it can swing open as if by magic on cue to allow in prime ministers, ministers, monarchs and assorted visiting dignitaries.  Or, on occasion, fail to open: as once when the Blair family were briefly left stranded on the doorstep, or worse in 2016 when US Secretary of State, John Kerry, came for his first meeting with Theresa May and walked straight into the door.  For those wanting to find a more discreet way into 10 Downing Street – and I will leave it to your imagination why that might be necessary – there is a back door, which does boast its own keyhole. If only they could train Larry the resident Downing Street cat to make use of it.There is something solid, serious and stately about today\u0027s glossy black door. Back in 1908, however, Herbert Asquith decreed – at the instigation, it is said, of his wife, the celebrated wit and socialite, Margot – that black was passé. Instead it was given a lick of what historical paint consultants have suggested was either Brunswick Green or Bronze Green, as popular then with those in the know as gold wallpaper is today.  The experiment didn’t last. Asquith\u0027s successor, David Lloyd George, known for his colourful turn of phrase and private life, proved to be more sober and traditional when it came to picking paint.If you have ever wondered why those delivering petitions to the Prime Minister can’t just slip their bundle of papers through the shiny brass letter box, there is an easy answer. Despite appearances, it is not a letter-box at all, but a shiny brass plate simply made to look like one (for security purposes) inscribed with the words First Lord of the Treasury. When Sir Robert Walpole took on the house in 1735, that was his official title, though he was de facto Prime Minister. All his successors since 1905 have held both offices simultaneously. The original lion’s head door-furniture was made of cast iron, the essential ingredient of the Industrial Revolution that began in Britain. At the outset of the First World War, soldiers about to depart for the trenches are reported to have walked up Downing Street to touch the knocker for good luck. During the 1960 renovations it was replaced by a brass lion\u0027s head painted black with Downing Street now out of bounds to the casual passer-by, it is in no immediate danger of being rubbed off.There are other alternatives at hand. Close by is the original door, on display in the Churchill War Rooms, or else wander down Whitehall, onto the Strand and turn into Adam Street, where a near identical front door, with similar frame and façade around it, is available free of charge at Number 10. But position yourself carefully for maximum authenticity. This door does have a lock.  More from NewsInvestment visas for dodgy Russian businessmen to be scrapped under Home Office plansTeam York: Who’s still backing Prince Andrew and can they save him?Ursula von der Leyen under pressure to freeze EU cash to Poland and HungaryRussia-Ukraine crisis: Moscow creating \u0026#39new normal\u0026#39 to contest sovereignty in Europe, says NatoOrgan transplants one step closer to ‘Holy Grail’ as scientists convert blood types in world firstStorm Eunice: ‘Stay indoors’ alert as 100mph gusts set to cause chaosMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tory faithful have new darling not truss","story":"Few politicians have emerged from the events of the last few weeks with their reputations enhanced, but the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, is the exception. His cool and deft handling of the Ukraine crisis has impressed even those who felt that he was only appointed because of his long-term support for Boris Johnson.So impressed are some of his fellow MPs that they even whisper about him having become a contender for the leadership. They can’t have failed to notice that he has overtaken The Trussette in the monthly Conservative Home popularity polls, and he has done it without trying to take the form of a Margaret Thatcher reincarnation.Certainly, he has resisted the oh-too-obvious photo opportunities that his predecessors loved so much. He doesn’t need to prove his credentials. He just gets on with the job, a lesson some of his more iridescent colleagues could learn from.Wallace seems to be a natural conciliator and has been seen as the leader among Europe’s defence ministers. “What does Ben think,” is the question most often asked by them. The Baltic states almost worship him and his article posted on the MoD website a few weeks ago, outlining what was at stake, is considered a masterpiece.It is true that the Defence Secretary doesn’t have the flair of a Sunak or the television mastery of a Zahawi, but he has “bottom”, and in war situations that counts for a lot. So yes, he now has to be mentioned as a contender – but as a contender for what?One senior Conservative told me that he would like to sit Wallace down and tell him to forget talk of becoming prime minister. What he should be aiming for now is to be the next secretary general of Nato.A Briton hasn’t held the post in nearly 20 years – in fact, not since George Robertson, who was defence secretary under Tony Blair. The alliance has lost its way. Perhaps Wallace is just the man to rescue it.I’ve probably spent more hours on the radio than any other presenter in the country discussing the Ukraine crisis. We have had some fantastic contributors. Tom in Brighton gave a masterpiece of a lesson on the history of Ukraine which was so good that I invited him to record a 40-minute podcast on the subject with me. On Monday, we had Alex in Nottingham giving us a tour de force on Vladimir Putin’s desire to create a Greater Russia. He spoke for 10 minutes with barely an interruption from me.However, what I have noticed above all else is the dark side of some of these conversations, where people ring in with one aim – to give Putin the benefit of the doubt and to question the motives of Nato or their own government.In previous times, they would have been called quislings. They genuinely believe that Nato is an evil force, bent on attacking Russia, while Putin is a leader who is merely intent on looking after his own people and probably loves animals, too. The BBC is biased in favour of the Conservatives and Russia Today is the very model of balance, according to these misguided idiots.I give as good as I get, and then get accused of hating Russia and being a warmonger. What has happened to us when, among a sizeable proportion of the public, the default position appears to be to automatically take the side of the country’s enemies?Iain Duncan Smith once said that a new political leader has 90 days to convince people they have got what it takes. Seventy-three days after the Republicans picked her to carry the centre-Right banner into the French presidential elections, Valérie Pécresse has convinced no one that she can beat the eminently beatable Emmanuel Macron. She looks the part, but her stuttering campaign is close to collapse.She tries to portray herself as a French Margaret Thatcher yet she convinces no one. On Monday she gave a pedestrian speech in a hangar in which even Barack Obama would have found it difficult to whip up a crowd. It was full of nationalist dog whistles, but it ignored the fact that the type of voters which this rhetoric appeals to won’t vote for a pale substitute. They have got Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour to choose from already.It’s not too late to dump Pecresse. Perhaps Michel Barnier’s time will come, after all? Ze clock is ticking.Today, the good burghers of the North East will be facing the wrath of Storm Dudley. This is somewhat ironic given Dudley is in the West Midlands.I had always thought the point of naming storms was to make people sit up, pay attention and worry. So let me pose a gentle question to you. Does a weatherperson uttering the phrase “Storm Dudley” or “Storm Eunice” (Eunice is next on the alphabetical Met Office list) strike terror into your heart and make you ponder battening down the hatches? Thought not.What we surely all want is Storm Tyson, Storm Griselda or Storm Cruella.

Surely it is time for him to help the Church of England’s bedrock: the parishes. For years now, they have been bled dry by the parish share system, with increasing demands to send money to the dioceses. As church membership declines – less than a million attend Church of England services on a Sunday - fewer and fewer loyal Anglicans are being asked to carry an impossible financial burden of funding their own parish as well as handing over substantial sums to what could be called regional head office. And insistence on change at local level must be matched by Welby knocking heads together to put an end to ever-increasing bureaucracies of the myriad dioceses with their jobs boom. Climate change officers, sustainability experts, inequality advisers – you can find them across the country in the CofE dioceses. Then there are the number of dioceses and their bishops. In a document leaked in the past few days that was written by Welby, the current Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, and Bishop of London, Dame Sarah Mullally, and full of phrases about “a new paradigm”, the problem was evident: there are 42 dioceses, each with a bishop, plus dozens of suffragan bishops as well. Buried within its pages is the admission that 27 of the 42 dioceses are operating on deficit budgets, although the document seems to suggest that there should not so much be a drop in episcopal numbers but non-diocesan ones who would “speak into particular issues”.

Race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust was granted the declaration by Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt after a High Court hearing in December. The Good Law Project joined the Runnymede Trust in the action. The judges ruled that the Runnymede Trust had sufficient standing to bring a public sector equality duty challenge but GLP did not.The ruling centred on Mr Hancockaposs decision to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection in August  and ex-Sainsburyaposs boss Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHS Test and Trace in September . Lawyers representing the two organisations suggested that people outside the tight circle in which senior Conservative politicians and their friends moved were not being given opportunities. They said an unfair policy was being challenged. Ministers disputed the claims made against them. Jason Coppel QC, who led the two organisationsapos legal teams, told Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt that the challenge was based on equality legislation and public law. He said the Government had a policy or practice of making appointments to posts critical to the pandemic response without adopting any, or any sufficient, fair or open competitive processes. Mr Coppel said people less likely to be known or connected to decision-makers were put at a disadvantage. He also said the Government was failing to offer remuneration for high-level full-time roles and excluding all candidates who were not already wealthy or held other posts for which they would continue to be paid.  Lord Justice Singh and Mr Justice Swt said in a written ruling: It is the process leading up to the two decisions which has been found by this court to be in breach of the public sector equality duty. For those reasons we will grant a declaration to the Runnymede Trust that the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care did not comply with the public sector equality duty in relation to the decisions how to appoint Baroness Harding as interim executive chair of the NIHP in August  and Mr Coupe as director of testing for NHSTT in September . Dr Halima Begum, Chief Executive of the Runnymede Trust, welcomed the findings. She said: “The judgement handed down today by the High Court is incredibly signicant to the British people. It shows the importance of the Public Sector Equality Duty and its role in protecting the people of this nation from the closed shop of Government appointments, not least in a time of national crisis where people from our minority communities were dying from Covid in hugely disproportionate numbers. Mr Hancock’s spokesman said the judgement aposthe claim brought by Good Law Project fails in its entiretyapos, therefore highlighting the fact this group continues to waste the courtaposs time. He said the High Court ruling “states that aposthe evidence provides no support ... at allapos for the allegation that Dido Harding secured senior positions on the basis of apospersonal or political connectionsapos in the Government”. He said: They accept these aposwere urgent recruitment processes which needed to find highly specialised, experienced and available candidates within a short space of time. Letaposs not forget, we were dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic where time was of the essence in order to protect and save lives.

He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - though it’s not thought this will actually happen next week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the comments Unions also fear the ability to claim Statutory Sick Pay from Day One of Covid isolation will be axed when current laws expire. And charities worry immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.Meanwhile Boris Johnson’s plan could kick vaccines for all children over five into operation, though the announcement of this looks set to be brought forward after Wales and Scotland both unveiled their plans in the last  hours.For holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation paymentor sick pay. Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Unions and Labour fear the right to claim Statutory Sick Payfrom Day One of Covid isolation will be axed.The £.-a-week payment is usually only available from the fourth day of illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day for Covid cases.But the power is contained within the Coronavirus Act , which could lapse in its entirety by the end of March. It is thought ministers may need to pass new laws to continue the ‘Day One’ SSP power, and they have not yet said whether they plan to do that. Sources suggested the issue was still being worked out. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady - who has long called for SSP to be increased and extended to more part-time workers - said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. “Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end next week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought next week’s plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axedFully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in next week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport is pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. However, it is thought there is only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, with health officials still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due next week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status is being considered by the government this week. An announcement is due on Monday.  Legal powers for councils will goThe legal change will also end remaining powers which authorities had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over fiveAll children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

Lyndi Cohen, from Australia, first became aware of her weight when she was just five years old, and began to believe she was bigger than other children her age. Writing for news.au, she recalled being in ballet class and wearing a pink leotard, while comparing her body to other kids in class. As she recalled feeling fat in her own skin, Lyndi said the perception she had of herself continued as she got older, and she still worried about her weight when she reached  years old. By now, I’d been told enough times, you’d be so prettyyou lost weight that I believed it, she wrote. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here At a young age, Lyndi was taken to see a nutritionist who put her on a meal plan - despite her weight being within the healthy BMI category. After she was given the meal plan, -year-old Lyndi began calorie counting on a restrictive diet, weighing what she ate and strictly controlling her portions. Lyndi recalled monthly weigh-ins which put her body under constant surveillance - andshe put on weight, sheaposd be distraught. The pressure she was under to be thin caused Lyndi to binge eat, which made her gain weight quickly. She wrote: By now my relationship with food was completely disordered. And I just wanted to feel normal around food again, instead of secretly binging on bowls of cereal, loaves of bread or peanut butter by the spoonful. She would avoid social events where she couldnapost weigh her food and weighed herself several times a day. Dreading a weigh-in with the nutritionist, Lyndi once went to the extreme measure of cutting off her hair so the scales wouldnapost go up as much.  As she became more and more obsessed with weight, she also walked an hour to school and back, before exercising more when she got home. However, she argues no one thought she had a problem with eating because I wasnapost thin. Continuing to see nutritionists throughout her teenage years, Lyndi said she didnapost realise she had a problem until she was trying on a dress for her friendaposs st birthday party and didnapost recognise what she saw in the mirror. Recalling hating herself she described going to the doctor immediately to explain her unhinged relationship with food. After spilling out her worries, Lyndi was put on anti-anxiety medication. She wrote: I knew my attitude towards food had become unhealthy, but was told by a health professional that the number on the scales meant I didn’t have a problem. I was too fat to have an eating disorder. Lyndi added the stigma around her weight meant her unhealthy eating habits were dismissed. Now working to educate people about eating disorders, she notes that they can apply to people at any size and those suffering who happens to weigh more are at risk because society tells people who arenapost stick-thin they need to be fixed. She has launched a Back to Basics app that aims to help people with healthy eating in a way that removes the stress. On her own journey, Lyndi saw a therapist who helped her overcome the guilt and shame she had around eating. She now says she eats when sheaposs hungry rather than as a response to feeling a strong emotion - which tastes better than aposthinapos can ever feel.

Tegan Clarke, now , was just  when she started feeling unwell after starting her degree at London politan University in September . After moving down to the big smoke from Leeds, she partied during her first few weeks at uni just like any other student. But after burning the candle at both ends, Tegan began to feel exhausted.She said: I was tired all the time, so I put it down to exhaustion from moving to uni and leaving home. I wasn’t eating proper home cooked meals and I just assumed I was a bit under the weather.”Recalling her first trip to the doctor, Tegan said they also thought she was just adjusting to being away from home comforts. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters hereShe said: At first, like me, they just thought it was aposfreshersapos flu,apos which is a term given to these kind of symptoms in new students, but with further tests, they showed I had acid reflux or heartburn.But after revisiting the doctor several times, a visit in November  revealed Tegan had a shockingly high heart rate. “He said he couldn’t really send me home and advised me to go to AE. Once there I had an ECG, to check my heart rhythm and electrical activity and blood tests done, Tegan said. After an anxious wait alone for the results, she received some devastating news. I was on my own when they told me I had a form of blood cancer and that I would need a biopsy to determine exactly what type I had.  It was a completely devastating diagnosis. I burst into tears. While her mind raced, Tegan recalled feeling like sheaposd been given a death sentence. “I have had a lot of family members die from cancer, so I was really scared,” she said. After calling her sisters to tell them the terrying news, they rallied the family to hop on a train down to London from Leeds. Meanwhile, a biopsy confirmed Tegan had non-Hodgkin lymphoma - a blood cancer that develops in the lymphatic system in the body. The student was admitted to St Bartholomewaposs Hospital where her family came to visit.She said: “My family came down from Leeds to visit me in hospital, but I felt very isolated being so far away from home, so the doctors agreed to transfer me by ambulance to St James’s University Hospital in Leeds. “Once there I went onto a Teenage Cancer Trust ward, where the other patients there were all  to  years old. It was really nice to be surrounded by other young people who were going through a similar experience. “The trust really supported me while I was there. I was in hospital for a week and I made a lot of friends with the other patients.” A week after receiving her diagnosis Tegan started six rounds of chemotherapy. Once sheaposd finished chemo in March , she had three weeks of radiotherapy. Having dropped out of university, Tegan had a long wait for the results of her scan to find outtreatment had worked.  Rather than sitting around, she spent the summer of  fulfilling her bucket list - including trips to Disneyland Paris and Amsterdam. She also spent a week in Corfu, Greece, with her family and made sure she accepted invites to every party she could. Finally in September , Tegan was given the all-clear. I couldnapost believe it. I had tried not to get my hopes up so this felt like a dream come true, she recalled. I’d been so focused on the present, but this outcome meant that I could now look to the future. After missing out on her studies for so long, Tegan went to an open day at Leeds Beckett University, and was accepted onto an accounting and finance course days before the new term began. Due to graduate this year, the student is grateful for her health and relieved to be living cancer-free. She said: “I feel like I’ve been given this new lease of le, a new chance to achieve my goals and enjoy my le. However she had a warning for young people who suspect something might be wrong with their bodies - as research from the Teenage Cancer Trust shows awareness of the main signs of cancer in young people is shockingly low.Do you have a real le story to share  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcTegan said: I would say to anyone who is concerned about their health to keep ing to their doctors until answers are given.

But after lockdown, residents of the block of  flats above the venue have claimed weekends have become a “nightmare” with bosses having revealed that it could become a live music venue on Fridays and Saturdays.And a mum-of-two, Rosie-Mae Deal, toldhow she has been brought to tears by the “ridiculously loud” music that was causing a huge amount of distress to her autistic son.“One night I sat crying in my home knowing I can’t do anything about this ridiculously loud music thumping through my flat, waking my children up, upsetting my little boy, who has autism so is very sensitive to sounds, she said.  “He sleeps in my bed because he’s scared. He covers his ears, he cries, he screams under his covers.” Rosie-Mae said the family should be able to feel “safe and at peace” in their own home. Another elderly resident, Ethelbert Crescent, has suggested the noise is bad due to it not having the correct soundproofing to manage the loud music. Ethelbert, who is in her s, explained that the blaring noise is affecting her health and had prompted her to avoid staying in her own home. When Georgina Powell and her partner moved into an apartment in the same block of flats, , they had been drawn to the idea of the arts hub that they could use on their doorstep.  Georgina said that the concept of the space had sounded “amazing”. But now, she and her partner - whose flat is directly above the venue - have now been forced to move out, and are now paying rent on top of their mortgage. Georgina compared parties held in the flat to the noise held in Fabric nightclub, with the floor vibrating and the couple able to hear “every word to Madonna”. Various noise complaints were logged by the Thanet District Council last year, prompting an application to review the licence to be submitted. According to the councilaposs environment and health team, the venue has not always adhered to their pm noise curfew. More measures were potentially necessary not to disturb the neighbours. However,  letters of support have reportedly been sent in favour of the venue, which some locals have called key to the community in the area. Representatives from eight of the  flats appealing to the council will appear in a council hearing due to take place on Thursday. Faith in Strangers has been unable to comment until a ruling is decided.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Forever tainted Andrew’s banishment from public le must be permanent after paying his sex abuse accuser a substantial sum to settle sordid charges he denied. Because the court of public opinion will reach its own verdict on the U-turning prince now commending the bravery of a victim, Virginia Giuffre, his team disgracefully accused of lying in a stomach-churning smear campaign. And hoisting the white flag over Buckingham Palace to avoid a court inquisition means a man who until yesterday considered it honourable to be the guest of a convicted paedophile can never openly clear his name.  The donation to Giuffre’s charity combined with avow to campaign against sex trafficking and that apology indicate who won. She did. He still lost. The question remains unanswered about what to do with befouled Uncle Andrew despite relief in royal circles an Emily Maitlis mauling with knobs on is averted in a New York courtroom. Sneak him into platinum jubilee celebrations and the Queen will besmirch  years to rehabilitate a favourite son who’d be safer for the family locked in the Tower. Stripping him of a few courtesy titles and recognising the armed forces want nothing to do with Andrew isn’t enough.  The riot act must be read to him and a public declaration there is no way back nailed to the gates of Windsor Castle. Andrew remaining ninth in line to the throne and continuing to enjoy the perks of royalty is an insult to all women. It also goes to the heart of the rottenness of a hereditary monarchy, permanently elevating one family over millions of better others.

And sources say it was the Queen and Prince Charles who p ut substantial pressure on the Duke of York to come to an out of court deal - said to be worth £million.The Firm is said to have wanted a settlement agreed so the case did not overshadow the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee year. Well placed royal sources said Andrew was under “intense pressure from the very top” to ensure a deal was done after a US judge last month rejected the duke’s bid to have the case dismissed. And itaposs not the first time royals including the Queen, Charles and Andrewaposs other siblings have put their foot down amid his legal troubles... Stepping back from public le  Itaposs long been thought that Andrew is Her Majesty favourite son, and sheaposs said to have had a far more hands-on relationship with when he was a child than his older brother Prince Charles. Royal expert Penny Junor once said: I think the Queen has always had a bit of a blind spot when it comes to Prince Andrew.But after giving a car crash interview on BBC Newsnight about his association with Jeffy Epstein, Andrewaposs royal role diminished as his mother approved him stepping back from public le and reportedly cancelled a milestone birthday party. In the days after the Newsnight interview was broadcast in , Andrew sensationally quit public le for the foreseeable future in a statement - approved by the Queen.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

He said at the time: It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support. Therefore, I have asked Her MajestyI may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. Birthday party axed Andrew celebrated his landmark th birthday on February , .But it was reported that the Queen cancelled a birthday bash she had planned for him and downgraded it to a small family dinner. The Queen hosted a lavish reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the Prince of Wales’ th birthday in November .But in the wake of allegations against him at the time, a similar party for Andrew didnapost happen. No way back In October, it was reported that Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Edward ruled out ato public le for Andrew during a get-together.According to the Sunday Times, a meeting was held in January , where Andrewaposs siblings were in agreement that their brother should never be allowed toto public le, an insider claimed. A source said at the time: “Nine months ago Charles, Anne and Edward had a meeting, a summit, and agreed there was no way back for him.” Titles stripped Last month, Andrew suffered another blow when he learned he was being stripped of his honorary military titles and royal patronages. He was said to be utterly devastated by his mother’s bombshell decision, which came after the Sunday People exclusively revealed Her Majesty would reluctantly strip her son of his prized roleshe did not resign. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: With The Queen’s approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been ed to The Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen. A royal source said: All of The Duke’s roles have been handed back to The Queen with immediate effect for redistribution to other Members of the Royal Family - will notto The Duke of York. The Duke of York will no longer use the style ‘His Royal Highness’ in any official capacity. Balcony appearance  However, itaposs not just since his legal battle that Andrew has seen other royals put their foot down when it came to him. In , the Queen was celebrating her Diamond Jubilee of  years on the throne - and an appearance by the royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony was planned.It was reported that Charles had a hand in the decision for only senior royals, such as the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, to appear on the balcony - leaving Andrew dismayed.  Royal expert Richard Kay wrote in the Daily Mail in : For Andrew, according to one close figure, being excluded from the balcony scene was a sudden and totally unexpected demotion from front-rank to peripheral royal. It was ‘like a dagger to his heart and he hasn’t got over it’.But this was a dramatic statement of intent by Charles, who long ago decided that when he is king the Royal Family would be ‘slimmed down’. But as a friend of the Duke of York says: ‘The speed and suddenness with which Charles has acted has taken Andrew’s breath away. It’s dreadfully high-handed.’ Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror.

In a bombshell announcement yesterday, it was announced that Prince Andrew had reached an out-of-court settlement with the -year-old.This means he will no longer face a civil jury trial over allegations that he sexually abused and raped her on three separate occasions when she was . Sources told the Mirror that there was intense pressure from the very top to clinch a settlement deal to prevent a trial. Although the parties have settled the case, the agreement is not an admission of guilt from the duke and he has always strenuously denied the allegations against him.  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up Overshadowing the QueenThe Duke allegedly told his mum, the Queen, on January  that his attempts to have the case thrown out of court had failed.It has been claimed that she then took advice from Prince Charles and Prince William, who made it clear to Andrew that the ongoing legal row must be solved. Following this, the Duke is understood to have instructed his lawyers to contact Ms Giuffreaposs legal team to discuss a settlement. It could not be signed before February  - the th anniversary of the Queen taking the throne - but now royal insiders hope it will not overshadow the national celebration in June.  Prince Andrewaposs legal team reportedly changed their approach after a date for his deposition was set. Thereported that an insider close to the negotiations told the paper: After his deposition, he would likely have been so damaged, no one could save him or agree to fund his settlement. This would have seen him be questioned under oath by Ms Gufreaposs legal team, on March . It has been claimed that royal insiders dreaded this, with American attorney David Boies saying he planned to question the royal for two days, under the glare of the international media. Mr Boies added that he thought the experience would be aposuncomfortableapos but didnapost plan to quiz any family members, including The Queen. Deal agreed over the weekend It has been reported that Prince Andrew, , signed the deal with Virginia, , late on Monday afternoon. The latest round of negotiations is thought to have lasted at least  days and the agreement announced on Tuesday, February .  In January, her attorney Mr Boies suggested for the first time that a settlement could be reached - but only on specic terms. He said: I think we would be unlikely to settle in a situation in which someone just handed over a cheque. SoPrince Andrew maintains aposIaposve never heard of this person,apos aposI donapost know who she is, then I donapost think that we would want to settle on that basis. That said,you have a settlement that was large enough to be, in effect, a vindication, then itaposs something we would obviously look at. Yesterdayaposs statement said the Duke never intended to malign her character, praising her bravery and acknowledging that she was a victim of abuse and had suffered as a result of unfair attacks. Royal finances expert and author David McClure said there is “enormous public interest” in the sum and the source of the funding being disclosed, saying: “I really think for once the royal family should come clean and say where the money came from.”  Agreed settlement It has been reported that the alleged total settlement of £m includes £m to Virginiaaposs charity, leaving her with £m. The settlement agreement states that Andrew will donate to Ms Giuffre’s charity in support of victims’ rights and that he has pledged to “demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein” by supporting the “fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims”. It thought that the royal will put towards money from the sale of his chalet in Switzerland towards the payout. The Dailyhas reported that part will be paid by the Queen. Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on Tuesday’s legal development, while Andrew’s representatives also declined to say how the donation to Ms Giuffre’s charity would be funded.  Platinum JubileeCourtiers now hope the settlement will draw a line under this scandalous and humilating peiod for the Royal Family. A source told the Mirror: Everyone is hoping they can start looking towards the Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer, as well as Westminster Abbey service to remember the Queen next month. Royal experts claim Andrew will never find a way back to public le, or be seen on the Palace balcony. Media lawyer Mark Stephens said Andrew is “reputationally toast” and said he has been effectively airbrushed from polite society.  Heaposs now facing renewed calls to give up one of his last remaining major titles Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who represents York Central, repeated a call made last month, saying Andrew should give up his association with the city out of respect. She said: “To demonstrate his seriousness in this endeavour, and his respect for those affected by abuse and the people of our city, I would ask that his first act of contrition is to confirm his support for the withdrawal of his ducal title.” Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror.

The government hopes to announce that an end to all Covid restrictions, including the mandatory period required for self-isolating, will be in place by the end of February.Parliament is currently on recess, but the Prime Minister is due to announce his plan for living with Covid when MPsnext week on Monday, February . Another change, this time to testing, is also likely to be announced. Boris Johnson looks set to unveil the change that could impact Brits up to £ at a time, as the UK looks to learn to live with the virus.So what is the change and why will Brits be charged   Will PCR tests be scrapped  Free PCR tests now look set to be scrapped and could cost people £they want to get their hands on one. The Living Safely With Covid plan is due to be published on February  and may well include the plans to scrap free PCRs.  PCR tests have been vital to determinea person has Covid, as they are more accurate than lateral flow testsand have become a requirement for travel to and from certain countries around the world at ious points during the pandemic. The hope is that LFTs becoming more widely available will mean PCRs will not be so heavily relied upon. Why are free PCR tests set to be scrapped   The Treasury will be hoping to save billions by announcing the end to free tests. Covid figures have taken a downward trend recently. The seven-day average has been falling since January .  However, UK Health and Security Agencywants the government to keep providing free tests until at least the start of April and some experts are also concerned that the changes will be taken as a signal by people with Covid that they should continue to mix in public setting, despite having clear symptoms of the virus. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,prebidUseTestRuntime:true,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,nonIframeMantisRecommender:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,amp.trackonomics.enabled:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,mantisRecommender.useIntTracking:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,trackonomics.id:reachplc_cDEYX_mirror,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],video.ctpFloatAndPark:true,felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youaposve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When Olena Veitaite was five months pregnant she and partner Michael Gapski were told their daughter would need surgery to repair her heart after she was diagnosed with a cardiac condition - an atrioventricular septal defect. Pola was born in June  with Downaposs syndrome and a hole in her heart.The family were referred to leading charity Rainbow Trust before her surgery at Alder Hey, LiverpoolECHO reports. Pola underwent her operation in January when she was six months old to repair the hole in her heart.  The operation was meant to last six hours, but after eight hours the doctor wanted to speak to the parents. Olena, from Blackburn, said: The doctor explained the operation had been very complicated and Pola had had dficulty breathing because of pulmonary consolidation, meaning there was some blood in her lungs. She had to spend ten days in intensive care, initially with an open chest and on breathing machines. It was incredibly hard.  It took  days for Pola to open her eyes as the mum said she cried tears of joy when her daughter appeared to be out of the woods. She added: On  January she opened her eyes. It was amazing and we cried constantly with joy. Gradually she became stronger and the tubes were taken out of her belly and step by step she was getting better. Since September  the family has been supported by Rainbow Trust Family Support Worker, Brodie Stockwell. Olena added: Over time we became more and more comfortable with Brodie and now she feels like a part of the family.When we were in hospital Brodie would accompany me on the ward as only one parent was allowed because of Covid-. I was sleeping at the hospital and only swapping with Michael so that I could eat meals. It was exhausting and having Brodie was such a support.On February , little Pola was finally able to come home. Olena said: As we opened the front door carrying Pola, Michael and I looked at each other and started crying with happiness and relief. We were so thankful that we were coming home with our baby. We love Pola so much and throughout it all Michael and I have always tried to keep positive and Brodie has been such a help.” Rainbow Trust supports families who face the very real possibility that their child might die. To mark the Trustaposs th anniversary they are creating a permanent presence in Liverpool to help families like Polaaposs. Rainbow Trust Chief Executive Zillah Bingley added: For several years we have been aware that there are a number of families in desperate need for the type of support Rainbow Trust provides in and around Liverpool. Rainbow Trust has supported families attending Alder Hey for treatment, like Pola’s family, but until now we have not been able to fund a new team in the area. Thanks to the incredibly generous donation from The Kentown Wizard Foundation this is now a reality. We look forward to working alongside the existing palliative organisations in the region to ensure that our new team can complement the existing support and together make sure that families receive the full care they require.

With his lawyers’ help he came across as a debauched, entitled social reactionary from the world of th century princelings that America cast off in . Andrew seemed to believe his rank made him unaccountable. And the aggression of his defence team in the New York civil action brought by Virginia Giuffre made it much worse. There was also a feeling in America that Andrew had already been judged in another court: The one convened by his own family.  Their draconian steps to strip him of his titles and banish him from public duties may not be trial by jury but it rang out clearly as an unequivocal condemnation by those who know him best. That does not, however, pacy federal prosecutors. They still want Andrew’s help in shedding light on the world of sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. By his own admission, Andrew had known and regularly met Epstein for two decades. In  the New York-based federal prosecutor, Geoffrey Berman, said Andrew “sought to ly portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate” in his investigation but had repeatedly declined to be interviewed. That was bad enough. But when Andrew’s legal team painted Virginia Giuffre as someone compromised by “her own wrongful conduct” rather than as one of the many victims of the depraved Epstein Ghislaine Maxwell menage, it reinforced a certain view of Andrew: That he was incapable of feeling any remorse for believing that he could circulate in that world without being tarnished by it.The Last Queen by Clive Irving is published in paperback by Biteback on Thursday, £..Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyCourt caseCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of York will now pay a figure, thought to be around £million, in order to settle the legal action. He has always denied allegations against him. Now it has been claimed that Andrewaposs mother, the Queen, will help her son in paying the costs. Thereports that some of the agreed cash will come from his mother, with a source saying: Walls were closing in fast. After his deposition, he would likely have been so damaged, no one could save him or agree to fund his settlement.”So how much money does the Queen have and how does she have a vast personal wealth  Here we take a look...The Queenaposs net worthAccording to the  Sunday Timesapos Rich List, the Queen has a net worth of £million.This is £million more than the Sunday Times estimated her net worth to be in . In , the Sunday Times also calculated the value of the entire Royal Family - which they estimated to be billion, which is about £billion.However, working out the Queenaposs finances are far from simple, as there are many restrictions and technicalities on some of the things she has to her name.Queenaposs pots of cash Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .The Queen pays for her day-to-day le using three separate pots of cash - the Sovereign Grant, the Privy Purse and her personal money. The Sovereign Grant is the money the government gives the Queen every year to support her work and is made up of taxpayer cash. The Privy Purse is cash generated by the Duchy of Lancaster - a portfolio of land, property and other assets of about , hectares in England and Wales. It has existed since  to provide an income for the Sovereign – who is also known as the Duke of Lancaster.  But the Queen canapost do what she wants with the Duchy – it is managed and run for her – but she receives all the net profits, which is millions of pounds each year. This is generally considered to be her private income – although some republicans argue that it is money that would go to the Treasurywe didnapost have a monarchyand so should be considered public funds. The Queen voluntarily pays income tax on the profits. She uses the money to pay for private and official expenditure – including meeting expenses of members of the royal family such as Andrew, Prince Edward and Princess Anne. She also uses it for the upkeep of Balmoral Castle. According to one royal expert,the Queen has helped out Andrew with the settlement it more than likely would have come from the Duchy of Lancaster, which is described as the Queen’s private estate”.  Royal finances expert David McClure, author of Royal Privilege: The Queen’s True Worth, said the source of any settlement funds to Andrew is of “tremendous public interest”, and called for the royals to “come clean and say where the money came from”. He said: I just would argue in view of the enormous public interest in it, in view of the fact that Prince Andrew is a public figure, he was in line to the throne, I really think that they should disclose the amount of money and where it’s come from.” Adding that he is “not optimistic” the information will be made public, Mr McClure said: “I wouldn’t be surprisedthey try and not say anything, because there’s a long history of secrecy to do with anything involving the royal finances, but given that it’s a public matter, given there’s so much pubic interest in the matter, I really think for once the royal family should come clean and say where the money came from.” Queenaposs other assets Many of the things Her Majesty owns, she owns as Sovereign on behalf of the nation rather than owning them personally. For example, while she owns the Balmoral and Sandringham Estates personally having inherited them from her father, the official Royal residences - including Buckingham Palace - must be passed onto her successor.This means Prince Charles will automatically own them, but again only as Sovereign, when the Queen dies.The same rules apply to many of the art treasures in the Royal Collection and most famously, the Crown Jewels.

During the -minute lecture, which was organised by the National Education Union , Dr Barnes outlined how schools should be moving towards a ‘gender free model’. The charity leader told the group that her ideas were working well in schools where it had already been implemented. Barnes showed attendees a ‘code of conduct’ that she encouraged schools to display at reception. The poster listed bullet points of all the characteristics protected under the Equalities Act, apart from sex. Barnes suggested that the options of ‘male’ and ‘female’ should be removed from school application forms, with a box for gender simply ‘left open’ instead. One attendee reportedly argued that teachers ‘do not take offence’ from words such as ‘Sir’ or ‘Miss’, saying they are only used to ‘get your attention’.

Yesterday, the Duke of York was spared a courtroom showdown after reaching a settlement in principle in the civil sex claim filed in the US with accuser Ms Giuffre.Ms Giuffre alleges she was forced by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex with the Duke on three occasions after being trafficked by the pair. Andrew has always strongly denied Ms Giuffre’s claims.The sum of the settlement will not be disclosed, but it is estimated that the Duke has agreed to pay £million - including two million that is expected to go to Ms Giuffreaposs charity. A carefully worded statement published yesterday indicated that Ms Giuffre will continue to share her story and that the Duke will support the fight against the evils of sex trafficking”.  Furthermore, it has been revealed the -year-old disgraced royal plans on making a substantial donation to Ms Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights. However, Ms Giuffre will be expected to wait before speaking in an apparent attempt to limit damage to the Royal Family during the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee celebrations, The Times reports.  One lawyer not involved in the case suspects the settlement would allow Ms Giuffre to write a book about her side of the story. Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor who is an attorney with the New York firm Rottenberg Lipman Rich, told The Times: Ordinarily, you would have a complete non-disclosure [agreement] on both sides.  He also said that in this case, “since it’s a settlement in the context of, on its face, an apology from Prince Andrew, he suspects Ms Giuffre “has agreed not to say anything [but] she will be in a position to write a book, probably for this Christmas season”. He added: “She will be free to say whatever she believes the truth is about Prince Andrew.”  Andrew has always denied Ms Giuffre’s claims and although a settlement has been reached he has not admitted any wrongdoing. Mr Epner estimates Prince Andrew has agreed to pay at least £.million to Ms Giuffre personally as part of the settlement.The legal deal will also include a donation to charity and legal fees. I have a reasonable estimate that his legal fees to carry the case through from where it is now to the end of a trial would have been million to million, he said. Yesterday, court documents published revealed that Prince Andrew regrets his association with paedophile Epstein and to show his remorse he plans on supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. A document submitted to a US court today said: Virginia Giuffre and Prince Andrew have reached an out of court settlement. The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffreaposs receipt of the settlement . Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffreaposs charity in support of victimsapos rights.  Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms Giuffreaposs character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks. It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein and commends the bravery of Ms Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.

The news comes after the UK has had to tolerate two years of Covid , with multiple iants like Omicron, Delta and Alpha taking it in turns to cause havoc, lock down the country and claim the lives of thousands of people. With signs emerging that Omicron is beginning to recede, the government has begun to dramatically scale back restrictions over the UK.In the biggest change yet, mandatory isolation for people who test positive for the virus is due to be lted on February . What is the new Covid iant   It has been labelled ‘Deltacron’ after seemingly exhibiting aspects of the Omicron and Delta iants that have, at dfering points, ripped through the UK. Its scientic name is BA. + B....Experts have reported it has developed in patients who caught both Omicron and Delta at the same time,WalesOnlinereports.The UK Health Security Agency, or UKHSA, is yet to deliver a verdict on how contagious this form of the virus is, or how dangerous it could be for people who catch it.According to theMail , the UKHSA is yet to announce how many cases of the hybrid have been found in the country.Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious diseases expert at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline: If both Delta and Omicron are falling then, in theory, this [iant] should struggle to take off. Covid iants that are products of recombination are rare but have been known to form at points throughout the pandemic - three cases have arisen in the past with hundreds having been infected. Speaking to the MailOnline, a UKHSA source said: We monitor everything as a matter of course, but we are not particularly anxious about this iant. The developments have led to Deltacron being included in the UKHSA’s iant surveillance report.Indiareports that the iant was initially believed to be a laboratory error, however, its inclusion in the report has signalled that the iant is real.The same publication reports that the UKHSA is yet to report whether the iant was imported to the UK or whether it is native. The Mail report that sources at the UKHSA is “not concerned” by the iant with case numbers remaining low. The findings are contextualised by generally positive news about Covid, with the number of people who have tested positive up to February  having fallen by ,, or .%, in the last seven days.

It means that he has now avoided a potentially explosive trial with the settlement said to be £million.In the past two years since giving a car crash interview on BBC Newsnight about his association with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Andrewaposs le has changed dramatically. Shortly after the sit-down interview, he sensationally quit public le - announcing it in a statement that was approved by the Queen.Meanwhile, just last month, the Duke of York was stripped of all his military affiliations and royal patronages by his mother the monarch. The statement from Buckingham Palace also said he would continue not to undertake any public duties. Now the civil claim against him has been settled, what could be next for Andrew  We take a look... Public roleThis year, Andrewaposs mother the Queen is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee after marking  years on the throne.In June, there will be a host of celebrations on a bumper four-day long bank holiday weekend. So will we see Andrew at these events or indeed carry out public duties in the future now a settlement has been agreed According to former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond, absolutely not. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .She told the Mirror: The Queen has already assured the smooth transition of the monarchy by expressing her wish for Camilla to be Queen alongside Prince Charles. And the new King will want a streamlined modern monarchy in which Andrew was already surplus to requirements. He is, of course, a much-loved son and is adored by his ex-we, Fergie, and their two daughters. He will remain part of the royal family into which he was born, and I am sure the Queen will include him in family le. But there can be no public role for him ever again.  The fact is that Prince Andrew will forever remain tarnished by more than a decade of speculation about his friendship with a convicted paedophile.However, a report last week suggested Andrew could make a public appearance at a remembrance service for his late father Prince Philip next month.Sources told the Sun Andrew is expected at the ceremony at Westminster Abbey on March .Duke of York title stripped   While Andrew may have been stripped of his military affiliations and his royal patronages - he still retains his Duke of York title.And even though the civil claim been settled, he is facing renewed calls to give up his ducal title. Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who represents York Central, says Andrew must remove his association with the city in light of the out-of-court settlement reached with Virginia Giuffre. She added that she welcomed the Duke of York’s pledge to donate money to his accuser’s charity, but said his relationship with disgraced Jeffrey Epstein had damaged the city’s reputation. She said: “Although it is a relief that Prince Andrew has finally acknowledged and expressed regret for his close association with a convicted sex offender and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, his long delay in doing so and initial response to the charges and Ms Giuffre have been source of deep hurt and embarrassment to many people across the city. “Carrying a title does create an ambassadorial relationship with that place, and for somewhere with a global reputation, such as York, this is extremely important.  “It is to be welcomed that he has now pledged to support the fight against the evils of sex trafficking and its victims. “To demonstrate his seriousness in this endeavour, and his respect for those affected by abuse and the people of our city, I would ask that his first act of contrition is to confirm his support for the withdrawal of his ducal title.” Quoting a poll from York’s daily newspaper The Press, she highlighted how  per cent of people in the city who were asked wanted Andrew’s association with it to be removed. Helping sex trafficking victims   In court documents filed yesterday indicating a settlement had been agreed, a statement was included in a letter submitted to US judge Lewis A Kaplan, who has been overseeing the civil sex claim brought by Ms Giuffre.In it, Andrew admitted his regret at his association with Jeffrey Epstein and also vowed to support sex trafficking victims. Part of the statement said: It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. “Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. “He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.”  However, Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor, has said that he has spoken with many sexual attack victims and claims they have told him they would not work with Andrew.Writing in the Mirror, he said: Victims have been so badly affected by the language his legal team has been using I cannot think any of them will want to be in the same room as him. I’m patron of nine charities working with victims of sex offending. However, he added: I’m happy to offer him the opportunity to meet victims, in confidence, to understand their suffering and how victim-blaming of the type he indulged in will have affected them.

Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted.Professor Wei Shen Lim, Covid chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , said: The Committee has carefully considered the potential direct health impacts of vaccination and potential indirect educational impacts.The main purpose of offering vaccination to --year-olds is to increase their protection against severe illness in advance of a potential future wave of Covid-.Here is all you need to know...  What is the advice  The JCVI advice is for parents of --year-olds to get them vaccinated “ they feel comfortable” to protect against possible future Covid waves. They fear that should a new iant trigger a wave, at that point it will be too late to get all children in this age group protected by vaccination in time. The very small chance of severe complications in this age group is thought to be bigger than the even smaller chance of severe vaccine side effects. Some % of - year olds are thought to have already had Covid, however immunity wanes over time, particularly against mild infection.  What is dferent about this advice  While the independent experts advise that this age group should have the jab, the JCVI have issued a more nuanced message and stress it is not an emergency programme like previous vaccine drives. They say parents should not rush to get them vaccinated against Covid at the expense of school time or other childhood vaccinations such as the MMR jab. In the older  to  age group so far . million have received at least one dose. What was considered when deciding to recommend jabs for this age group  While school absences were considered this was not a signicant factor. This was because pupils can require time off with mild side effects - such fever, headache or sore arm - as well as requiring time off due to Covid. The main factor was the risk of serious illness to the child. The JCVI weighed up the extremely low risk of severe Covid symtoms versus the extremely low risk of severe vaccine side effects.  What is my child’s risk  In a future Covid wave between  and  cases of a rare inflammatory condition called PIMS-TS triggered by Covid will be prevented for every million double vaccinated - year olds. The JCVI also estimates that between  and  Covid hospitalisations will be prevented per million double jabbed in this age group, as well as up to three ICU admissions. This was compared to the risk of the most worrying vaccine side effect of Covid- vaccines, known as myocarditis. This is inflammation of the heart muscle and it is still unclear how harmful it is in the long term. The JCVI estimates it occurs in less than two per million children given the Pfizer jab.  How will rollout work It is yet to be decided whether vaccines will be administered to - year olds in schools or NHS centres.From April this age group will be offered two  micrograms doses of the Pfizer vaccine This is much less than the  microgram doses given to adults. They will be administered at least  weeks apart but the second dose may be delayed so it can be administered during school holidays. This is to avoid school absences caused by minor side effects such as fever, headache and sore arm.

Speaking to Vogue, Celilo said she still cannot believe she was selected for the campaign. aposI used to watch the Victoriaaposs Secret fashion show and wish that I could be up on that stage. aposEveryone wanted to be in that club, but you knew you didn’t belong there, she said. She added that when she started modelling she tried to lose weight in order to fit a size she could not sustain because she believed it was the done thing. The campaign also features plus-sized models like Paloma Elsesser, and Devyn Garcia.Voguehas noted the collection is the first under the tenure of Victoriaaposs Secretaposs new creative director Raúl Martinez, who has been working hard at rethinking how the brand markets itself to women.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON New York Fashion WeekLingerieDowns syndrome\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Thinking he was just enjoying the lights, his mum Madhu Kumar didnapost think too much of it - but he was actually surfing the net and splashing the cash. The family from New Jersey, US, got a knock at the door days later and piles and piles of huge boxes were sitting there ready for them. After looking at her online banking, she discovered almost , was missing.  The decor-loving lad, who is nearly two, had placed orders for chairs, flower stands and additional household items. A number of them were so large that they could barely fit through the front door.Ayaansh, who decided to order a number of items more than once, will have trouble repeating the trick in the near future. The family plan to keep a couple of the items as a memento of their totaposs adventure and have ed the rest to a nearby Walmart supermarket.  Thankfully, they have been told they will receive a refund. But Madhu told NBC New York she is taking measures to make sure no more online shopping can take place. He’s so little, he’s so cute, we were laughing that he ordered all this stuff, she said. It is really hard to believe that he has done this, but that’s what happened.  I need one or two items, why would we need four of the same thing  The mum has said that she will be placing much tighter controls on all her devices to prevent any more of Ayaanshaposs shopping sprees. She added: Moving forward, we will put tough passcodes or face recognition so when he picks up the phone he finds it in locked condition.

At any wedding, the newlywed husband and we are the focal point and usually hold most of the attention - and itaposs up to the guests to follow dress codes and instructions laid out by the stars of the show. But one mum on Reddit has been left fuming after she was recently kicked out of her cousinaposs wedding for letting her four-year-old daughter wear a tiara to the event, and then refusing to take it off when she was asked to do so by the bride.Sharing her story anonymously, the woman said her daughter has a fascination with princesses and loves wearing tiaras, but was asked to take the hair accessory off at the wedding because the bride wanted to be the only one wearing one.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The -year-old mum wrote: My daughter Chloe has a fascination with princesses. She loves the colour pink, wears only dresses, and has an array of tiaras that she wears everywhere - except to pre-school, where she canapost. My cousin Alex invited us to his wedding, which was this past Saturday. Chloe was excited because she got to dress up and stay dressed up the entire time. She also couldn’t wait to see the bride’s dress. She askedshe could wear her princess tiara and I said of course. We got to the wedding on time. However, the start time was delayed for unknown reasons.  minutes after it was supposed to start, one of the bridesmaids came out and told me that the bride, Jen, was refusing to come out because my daughter was wearing a tiara.  I thought she was joking but she wasn’t. Apparently, the bride was also wearing a tiara and wanted to be the only one wearing it. The mum put her foot down and refused to remove her daughteraposs tiara, but was confronted by her cousin Alex, who told her she would have to leave the weddingshe didnapost comply with the request. She added: I told the bridesmaid that Chloe loves tiaras and always wears them. The bridesmaid said aposnot today she isn’tapos and told me it needed to be removed. I said no. The bride is a grown woman and was being petty over a child’s tiara. The bridesmaid left for a couple of minutes and then Alex himself came out. He told me to leave. I asked why and he said it was because I won’t tell Chloe to take off her tiara.  I said this was ridiculous and Alex said it’s not my wedding and when I get married then Chloe can wear one to mine, but that I’m officially uninvited regardless. Others around me told me to just take it off and I wouldn’t. Alex’s mum came over and escorted us out. The mum was baffled by the turn of events but agreed to leave the wedding - with her daughter left upset and crying out of fear that sheaposd done something wrong. She said: Chloe was upset and crying because she feels she did something wrong, and I’m upset because I can’t believe someone would be jealous over a literal -year-old. I also feel bad because Chloe was really looking forward to seeing Jen’s dress because she loves wedding dresses. But no one is on my side. And while commenters on Reddit agreed that the request to remove the tiara was slightly over-the-top, they also believed the mum was petulant and entitled for putting her foot down on the issue. One person wrote: You seriously need to parent-up and teach your kid that thereaposs a time and place for indulging your inner princess, and a time and place for sitting back, following dress codes and letting other people shine. For example, at their own goddamn weddings. You were asked nicely but were petulant and entitled. You caused this, itaposs not over a child, itaposs over your lack of parenting. Thereaposs a reason nobody is on your side. While another added: I agree with this. The four-year-old should be taught the time and place for attire. She didnapost wear a tiara to preschool, as mentioned by the mum, so a wedding is also a specic occasion. I personally would find it cuteI were the bride, but everyone is dferent I guess.

Sharing his reasoning on Reddit, he explained how his -year-old sister has been treating her golden retriever like a child and even refers to herself as its ‘pawrent’.Labelling her as ‘delusional’, the final straw came when she invited her family to the dog’s second birthday party, with strict instructions to bring the pooch presents.The man said: “She sent me an invite for my aposnephewapossapos birthday bash - it disgusted me. “I talked to a couple of family members and we all laughed at her suggestions.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. “My family thinks she needs therapy, while I think she is delusional.But it seems like there are a lot of people who spend their money on dogs.” He told his sister he was “too busy” to be able to attend the dog’s birthday party - and went through with his plans to watch a basketball game at his friend’s house.But his sister, who checked up on him on Instagram, deemed this an unacceptable reason to miss out on her golden retrieveraposs party.“She called me to tell me I was an a***hole,” he said. “I replied that I did not want her toxicity in my le and that she could go play pretend with her dog, but not expect any of us to part-take in this fantasy of hers. “She began crying and hung up.” The man later found out that nobody turned up to the dog’s birthday party, and although not at all surprised, he has been questioning whether he was too harsh on her.  While most users agreed he was not in the wrong for not wanting to attend the party, he could have handled it dferently. One user said: “Youaposre not the a***hole for not going to a dog birthday party because thataposs weird. “However you are the a***hole for laughing at your sister and belittling her. “If you genuinely think she needs help, talk to her and your family about it. Donapost just laugh behind her back.” While another said: “I agree itaposs overboard. I understand, not everyone is into their pets. But she loves her dog for a reason. Like every pet owner. “Another thing that bothers me is when you said: ‘Treating the dog as a child’. “The dog is the equivalent of a child. People forget this, but dogs are entirely dependent on us and have nothing  in their le aside from us, as their caretaker. “Is there an argument that weaposre imposing human qualities onto them like celebrating birthdays . Yes. “A dog isnapost going to be offended that no one comes to their birthday. All they care about is food, belly rubs and zooming around the park. “But dogs have emotions and feelings. They are bred to be dependent on us. We are their entire le. “So forget the lies that itaposs just a dog and not like a child. It is their child. Itaposs just imposing human qualities on them that people donapost get and rightfully so. “If anything, the fact she focuses so much love on her pet dog and her family ridiculing her suggest they arenapost supporting her in the first place.”Do you have a story to sell  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Birthday partyTherapyTeamDogsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Animal lover Emmabele describes Rosie as a aposbundle of joyapos and photos she shared online of her weight loss transformation have racked up more than , likes, comments and shares.Emmabele, of Thomasville, North Carolina, US, said: Sheaposs almost like a completely dferent dog. She can do so much more.The biggest transformation weaposve seen is watching her run because for years she couldnapost.She was just so slow with walking because of all the excess weight she had but now sheaposll run out the backyard or after a ball. Itaposs just completely night and day for that.She has done very well with her weight loss.All of our friends, and family in particular, some of them have mentioned to us over and over how great she looks. They cannot believe itaposs the same dog and theyaposre so proud of everything that weaposve done and that sheaposs been able to do.People havenapost recognised her. Iaposve posted pictures online and some of my friends have said aposthataposs Rosie  Thataposs the same dog apos.Rosie, who is a golden retriever, labrador, husky and chow-chow mix, was rescued by Emmabeleaposs in-laws when she was around four years old in .Emmabele said: We took her to the vet shortly after my mother-in-law passed away and thataposs when they told us she was the biggest dog they had ever had in the veterinary practice, which was very surreal to hear.They said thatwe wanted her to live a happy, long, healthy le, she wonapost be able to do it the size that she is.When we heard that we knew that we needed to give her the best rest of her years that we could.My husband and I took care of her and took it upon ourselves to do everything we could to get Rosie the healthiest she could be because at that point she was the heaviest she had ever been.Even with her being overweight, she has always been such a loving, happy and just awesome dog.You would never think that for a dog of her size she would still just be so playful and loving towards others. Sheaposs always been such a bundle of joy.Emmabele, who works in a childrenaposs hospital, said that multiple people were needed to hoist poor Rosie onto the examination table and scales.She was also told during their trip to the vets thatthey didnapost take drastic action it was unlikely that sheaposd live much longer given she was at high risk of developing an injury or diseases like cancer.Emmabele said: Her weight definitely crept on over the years. She is a mixture of four dferent breeds, which all have completely dferent metabolisms.The vet said that a mixture of the metabolisms seems to be what caused her weight gain because she wasnapost able to metabolise the food and burn off the calories the way that other dogs do.For years it was Rosie with her sister Piper who was a golden retriever terrier mix.She would eat the same things as her and was super active, but for whatever reason Rosie just always gained weight from what she was eating.Back then sheaposd eat some dog food but I think it was primarily table food.I think my mother-in-law was unable to resist her sweet little face and would give her all sorts of extra treats and stuff like that.Typically theyaposd give her a little bit of her dried dog food and put some shredded chicken on top of it, maybe some type of vegetable or a bit of egg and some boiled pasta over that. Pasta was a big thing.Before:Breakfast and dinner: Little bit of dried dog food with shredded chicken, egg and boiled pasta.Table food from owners.Treats: Vanilla wafer dog cookies or peanut butter dog treats. Now: Breakfast and dinner: Diet food with water.Treats: Healthier organic treats with blueberry and pumpkin or fresh seedless watermelon.She was very slow, weaposd try to take her on walks and it was just so hard for her. Just going on a walk for five minutes sheaposd have to stop every few steps.She would push through it and do her absolute best but I could tell that she wanted to do better.Sheaposd try and stay close to her sister and it was hard for her to see her move so much faster and she had to sit there and kind of watch. I could tell that it bothered her.Rosie started her diet in May  after the vet prescribed her specic food and treats and Emmabele also bought her an elevated feeder to help with her digestion.As Rosie started to shed some pounds, they then incorporated exercise into her routine and she now enjoys regular trips to the dog park. The apossweetapos and aposfriendlyapos pooch now weighs five and a half stone and has maintained since December.Emmabele said: We have stairs in our backyard and she would have to go up and down them to go to the bathroom.At one point sheaposd stand at the bottom and I guess almost prepare herself to go up them and sometimes weaposd have to encourage her.Even those two or three steps sheaposd struggle with.It was hard for her to even get in and out of the car, we had to have a ramp because she couldnapost hop in and out.She jumps for toys now and she definitely couldnapost before. She can jump in and out of the car by herself and roll on her back now as before she couldnapost roll over completely.It has amazed us to see all the things she can do now and seeing her realise that she can do them. She can do just about anything she wants to do.

Scott Thompson fell into the Santa Barbara Channel, near the city of Santa Barbara, off the coast of Calornia, sometime last month wearing only shorts and a T-shirt. He said the terrying ordeal happened in the middle of the night, miles away from dry land. He said: I thought to myself, great, this is how Iaposm going to die. Today is the day Iaposm going to die. His motorboat continued on without him, with Thompson saying that this was when he realised he was in serious trouble. He tried swimming towards the boat, but quickly realised it was getting further away. Thompson is reportedly an experienced swimmer and an expert er, but he nonetheless felt panic set in as the cold chilled his body.  Thompson told himself to keep swimming and, thinking of his family, he started moving through the water. He said he told himself to just keep swimming, you gotta get home to your family. Thompson said: I was devastating myself, through my mind, just picturing my girls and my son growing up without me, and my we, you know, not having a husband to support her... “I wasnapost thinking about sharks or anything like that, until I hear this splash. He quickly realised it was a medium-sized harbour seal and he said it went under the water and nudged him like a dog comes up and nudges your leg. He reportedly saw it as a sign from God that he could make it. He said: Did it know, like hey, this human is in trouble, hey keep going dude  He kept swimming, not towards dry land, but towards an oil rig, which, while far away, was closer to him than the shore. He said: It started getting brighter and Iaposm just like, Iaposm crying. And Iaposm like, shouting at the sky. He was noticed by the crew on the  and they rescued him from the water. He was then taken by the coastguard to hospital, where he was treated for hypothermia among other ailments. His vessel was retrieved by a tow boat crew, who reportedly could not believe that he had survived the ordeal. Channel Watch Marine Paul Amaral said: Even putting on a wetsuit, being prepared, getting in that water, and swimming to the  was horrendous.

Eight years after the flight vanished, a new report claims to have found the “exact location” of the Malaysian Airlines jet.It vanished in March , along with the  passengers and crew onboard, with no one able to confirm what happened to it. The plane departed Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing on March , but lost contact with air traffic control after  minutes. However now, new technology could solve the nearly decade old mystery. Australian air safety investigators have renewed their search after a report from Richard Godfrey, a British aerospace engineer.  He has claimed that the plane went down km west of Perth and currently sits at the bottom of the ocean under ,m of water. Angus Mitchell of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has renewed focus on what he calls “the largest unsolved mystery of our time”. Mr Mitchell stressed he did not want give the victims’ families  hope, but said that Mr Godfrey’s research was “credible” but stopped short of saying it would be enough to find the aircraft.In an upcoming Sky News Australia documentary, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has confirmed it and Geoscience Australia have been looking over Godfreyaposs data. While the bureauaposs involvement in the search officially concluded five years ago, their new chief commissioner Mitchell has renewed focus on the missing plane. Godfrey, a Germany-based Brit, first became interested in doomed flights after the Air France Flight  vanished on its way from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, in May .  He had been due to fly on it, but was asked to remain in South America on business, which delayed his departure by two weeks, saving his le. The flight disappeared with  people on board and it was only found in the Atlantic two years later. He said: When I saw that Air France  had crashed in the middle of the Atlantic I got involved in reading up on that story and followed the underwater search for the wreckage.

Juju Vieira, who is originally from Brazil, was on a trip to Saint Peteraposs Basilica at the heart of the holy city during a trip to Rome in January. The model, who was wearing a fitted dress and long boots during her visit, claims that while there she was told she was not dressed properly and asked to leave. Since then Juju, who is baptised and was raised in a strict Christian home and regularly attended mass, claims she has been persecuted by trolls online, who are sending hateful message. “I met the lack of God in the hearts of people who call themselves Catholic in the worst possible way,” she said.  They found out my number and I even received threats. I don’t identy with that kind of religious conduct.”According to the Instagram star, who has , followers, the verbal attacks are mostly coming from the most orthodox part of the community.As a result of what happened at the Vatican and the resulting abuse, she has now decided to give up her faith and explore other religions. “I want to be who I am, dress the way I want, sexy or not,” she said. I want to know other religions, today I identy more with spiritism”. The Vatican has a strict dress code for both men and women, which involves covering shoulders and knees. The website states: “Women are not permitted to wear sleeveless tops, crop tops, or tight shirts. Shoulders should be covered, andwearing a skirt or dress, it must cover the knees. “It is usually a good idea for women to bring a shawl and a pair of leggings when visiting during the colder months, as well as a light jacket that can be rolled up into a pleasingly tiny bag.”Juju said: “I went to the Vatican like everyone  goes to take pictures. “A gentleman who worked there came close to me and said that the place was for prayers and that I was not dressed properly and invited me to leave, aposkickedapos me out of the Vatican. “I was embarrassed because there were other people there who heard this. I felt disrespected.” Juju claims she was not aware of the code and was dressed as she would normally for a day out. The model said: “I didnapost even know there were rules.  A person of common sense will not visit the Vatican in club clothes. I was stylish in my winter clothes, everything matched. “I went in comfortable clothes that I would feel good in for long walks. Comfort was my only concern.” Juju also shared her experience with her Instagram followers in a video. Speaking in Portuguese, she told them the story, describing it as an “unpleasant situation”. One person wrote: “This is absurd my friend.” Another simply posted shocked face emojis. Others however claimed that it is common for people to be asked to leave for not following the dress code. One person wrote: “Well,you go dressed with deep necklines, very tight clothes, thataposs normal. They didn’t let my niece in also with a miniskirt and belly out.” Thehas contacted the Vatican for comment.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

Before joining farming, I had no idea the community was so heavily impacted by bad mental health.#If one person reads about Mind Your Head and decides to reach out or to check in on a loved one, that’s a step in the right direction.#Please, be that person and start the conversation.

What his example has meant for all of us we can only dimly comprehend.#Our respectful and affectionate sympathy in these days is constantly with our Royal Family.#To a new queen, so young, and yet so well equipped for the high duty to which she has been called, we pledge our loyal service in all the days to come.#My most memorable experience in a public le, extending to more than  years, was when I had the honour and privilege of a private conversation with his late Majesty King George VI.The occasion was when the Conveners of Counties and the Provosts of Burghs in the West of Scotland were presented to their Majesties in the Town Hall, Greenock, on July  .Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied the King and Queen.After being presented to His Grace, the Duke of Montrose, I, in turn, introduced the Provosts and their wives of the six burghs in the County of Argyll.Shortly afterwards, I was summoned to His Majesty#s presence.The King immediately put me at ease by asking me to sit down and join him in a cup of tea. He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up. They will also provide your lettuce seedlings with protection from birds and slugs.Good ieties to start now include cut-and-come again Salad Bowl – oak leaved, high yield with green and red ieties a cos such as Lobjoits Green – dense, crisp heads with self folding leaves or the small butterhead Tom Thumb – perfect for growing in small spaces, it matures early and has a mild taste.Prepare for

charging solutions” for people without a driveway or safe place to charge at home.Additional sensors will be installed nearby at Esk- side East, where the council will deploy further bollard-style ‘on-street’ chargers following successful trials last year.These chargers will continue to have no parking restrictions next to them, as the council says it recognises parking is at a premium in many residential areas.To address the fear these kinds of charger are frequently blocked, the Fuuse App will display the availability of parking spaces and not just the status of the chargers themselves.EV drivers who remain in charging spaces beyond a permitted duration – or after their session is complete – can also receive notications to vacate the space, allowing others to access the charger and avoiding fines.Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Council transport spokesperson, said: “For those who don’t have a safe place to park and charge at home, seeing live, on-street status in their area will address potential concerns over finding an attractive space close to their home.“We know this can deter people from switching to EVs.“For those that choose to use our many destination or

Were the white-toothed, perennially cheerful brothers too nice and squeaky clean to have had a pop le worth writing about What of the music, Jay  How did the boys from Utah feel when Donny’s arrival onto the stage dragged them from the pop- rock world into the land of ‘bubblegum And what of the dynamic of The Osmonds  How do you keep seven egos in check, decide who holds the power  And there’s the religious factor. In the s and s, The Osmonds were rarely described without the adjective Mormon attached.We begin however with a chat about how the musical came about. “Five years ago I was thinking of writing a book about our story when a producer friend of mine said he thought the story should become a musical,” says the band’s drummer. “And he said it should be told from my perspective. Now, I’ve never written a musical before. And we’d been approached several times over the years with offers to create a musical based on The Osmonds. But the timing felt right and he encouraged me to go it alone.”Jay Osmond met with Andrew Lloyd Webber’s producers and five years later the story has been completed. He recognised immediately, however, it couldn’t be just a series of links to connect the  songs performed in the show.“I wanted to show people the dferent sides of The Osmonds. People knew we had a tight-knit group but no one knew the reason for this. I wanted to reveal what made us tough [dad George instilled this] and how we managed to get over the obstacles.”The story begins in  when the brothers were hired to appear on the Andy Williams Show and took America by storm.We flash forward to the s and then back to the s, which suggests the script is far from simplistic.Osmond also had to trace the group’s evolution, from iety act to pop rockers, to chart toppers. The shting tones gave the band longevity but must have created schisms  “I love that question because it sums up the reality of conflict exactly. It was hard, because we played as The Osmonds, and then Donny joined and we became his backing band.“It was hard for people to categorise us. You know, we’ve put out  albums over the years, we’ve sang and danced and done it all, but because of that you have identity issues.”In the same yearwhen Donny came out with Puppy Love, the brothers released the rocking Crazy Horses. And when you add to that little Jimmy Osmond’s Long Haired Lover From Liverpool, the team were covering all the bases, but radio station playlist schedulers found them hard to pigeon hole.Jay Osmond knew that the show, which features two sets of Osmonds,had to address that dilemma.But he also had to deal with their personal lives, holding relationships together, all the time remembering they were a family unit, as well as a band.“We had a voting system,” he reveals, with the hint that democracy wasn’t always smooth.And there was the Mormon tag. Did the association deny them the chance to be seen as rockers  “Well, it’s almost like you’ve seen the musical because that’s exactly what we deal with. At one point we were called ‘The Mormon Von Trapp family.’”What of the disparate voices in the band  Has he reflected those in his writing  “Yes, the Osmonds’ story may have been dferent had it been written by Merrill for example. Or Donny. So, I wrote it how I saw it. And you’re right I was concerned at first that this was my story.“But each one of the brothers has come up to me and said how much they support the project. And the other night Donny wrote me a note saying, ‘Not only do I support this, I believe in you.’”That’s nice. But then that’s what you’d expect from The Osmonds. Fundamentally nice people who look out for each other. “We’ve always had this ‘one for all and all for one,’ motto.” He grins: “But as you can imagine, it’s sometimes been dficult to push your own priorities aside.”What have been the toughest parts of the Osmond’s journey  The constant pressure to produce albums  Going out on the road constantly  Having to wear the Elvis rhinestone suits, or cope with Donny and Marie on the telly  “One of things I struggled with was bringing out my personal view within a family system.\"And how to progress musically. On top of that we had a lot of dferent people telling us what to do. And yet all the time we had to make the decisions that were best for the family.”It’s a dynamic most groups never even have to contemplate. “But I think we pulled it off. We’ve had people come up to me and say, ‘Wow, what a boy band!’ And they’re talking of a band that was in the charts  years ago.”Indeed. The Osmond’s story is tale of longevity. And fun. And some very good songs. But with some searching into how it was all possible.There’s little doubt that Wyoming-based Jay Osmond has loved the family band journey, even coping with all the competition that came their way, such as the Bay City Rollers. “The boys were great,” he says with real generosity of spirit. “The Jacksons were our buddies.”His voice becomes a little more serious. “You know, the hardest part of my career has been putting this musical together, so that it’s real and heartfelt.”The reviews suggest the drumming Osmond has pulled it off. And it’s a chance to showcase his own talent.He adds “I’ve always been a team player, never one to go up front but this has changed that. And I feel great about it.”The Osmonds - A New Musical, Kings Theatre, Glasgow, runs until this Saturday .

Let’s not throw away this huge opportunity that we have.With regard to the cost of fuel, as mentioned by Leonard Maguirethe increase in cost is not the fault of the renewable energy companies, it is profiteering by the major oil and gas companies. A windfall tax on these companies could help alleviate the dficulties that many people are having heating their homes. In the mid to long term these dficulties will be overcome by relatively cheap renewable energy. In addition, it will be no longer possible for foreign countries, and indeed the big oil companies, to literally and metaphorically hold us over a barrel and increase prices once renewables become our main source of energy.And,your correspondents cannot see the signicance of reduced carbon footprints and preventing climate change, let them note the serious storms that we have been having recently which may well be a portent of increasingly dficult weather problems coming our way.So, come on Scotland, let’s lead the world in renewables the way we did in offshore oil and gas.John Palfreyman, Coupar Angus.* IT is dficult to see how a reduction to Scotland’s minuscule . per cent of global emissions could make any dference to our climate, and I suppose Lorna Slater and her party would not be able keep the lights onoil production stopped as they intend.

Whose freedom are we talking about exactly Freedom in the purest sense is only possibleyou live in a bubble, alone, or on a desert island where your actions have no bearing or result on others.Now, people are entitled to their own opinion, as long as it is not coercion to their own world view. Presumably, since these freedom fighters think that most people dont die, they dont mind many more filling hospital beds unnecessarily. And,they are one of those needing hospitalisation, they dont mind sacricing their hospital bed for others and suffering or even dying horribly in their own home, without causing a fuss. Or,they find their hospital bed is filled, when they need an urgent operation for an unrelated matter, they dont mind waiting in pain.Tellingly, this protest is more about themselves, not others.Trevor Rigg, Edinburgh.TELL THE PENICILLIN BACK STORYI HEARTILY endorse the wish expressed by Alastair Clarkthat you and other publications will commemorate the centenary of the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming.The story is well known: Fleming had ed from a holiday, and was tidying up his laboratory, disposing of old petri dishes and their contents. However, he was struck by seeing that one dish, in which had contained a culture of a very virulent micro-organism, had been contaminated by mould, and this mould had markedly disrupted the germs growth.Most peoplewould probably have thought How interesting\" and simply dunked the dish into the bucket of disinfectant. Fleming appreciated the signicance of this finding, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine.He thought that this discovery could be used to identy germs, but its development into a drug followed a rather convoluted path.It was not until  that the therapeutic aspects of penicillin began to be explored in Oxford by Howard Florey, from New Zealand, and Ernst Chain, a refugee Austrian Jew . Florey and Chain cultured the mould, and extracted penicillin from it, successfully treating patients for as long as they could maintain supplies, but they were working on a very \"cottage industry\" basis.In order for penicillin to become widely available, it was necessary to enlist the help of the US pharmaceutical industry, which could produce it on a large scale. Even so, they had much dficulty, because the penicillin molecule is fastidious.Thus, I hope that any journalistic production would, as well as praising the pioneers, spare some effort to celebrate the contributions made by many others which must have saved countless lives, and prevented much disability.Christopher W Ide, Waterfoot.ON NEUTRAL GROUNDPERHAPS it might be an idea to revert to some previous post-revolutionary gender-neutral terms for everyone: for example, Citizenor Comrade .

We have the existing arrangments of the wearing of face masks in public and to a certain extent within the school estate although that is going to be changing.Mr Swinney said it was important to have a legal framework in place to be able to act swlycases surge once again to protect public health.He said: \"Covid has not gone away, its not ended. Anyone who puts that argument around is just misleading people.\"Covid is still a signicant theat to public health. Weve got to proceed with care but also apply the proportionate test and thats what the Scottish Government looks at, at all times to make sure the measures are proportionate.\""},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-242-todays-wordle-february-16-hints","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way. Today’s word starts with the letter C and ends with the letter K.There are  vowels in today’s word.It is a waterproof filler and sealant. If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

The jab has also been on offer to this age group in a number of countries around the world including Ireland, Canada and Israel.One MHRA official said that parents could be reassured that “this is a very safe vaccine”.– Are children not at low risk from Covid Yes, the vast majority of children are at low risk from Covid-. In fact it is estimated that % of children in this age group have already had Covid, many with mild or no symptoms at all.But a small number are at serious risk of severe illness requiring hospital admission.The JCVI said that offering vaccines to this age group would “protect this very small number of children from serious illness and hospitalisation” in the event of a future wave of disease.– Did the JCVI examine school absences Yes, it was a tricky debate. In the US some % to % of children took time off school after having a jab due to mild side effects but on the other hand, vaccination could prevent some infections and therefore prevent some children needing to take time off school.The JCVI concluded that the effect of vaccination on the disruption to education was “indeterminate”.– I am still on the fence, should I get the vaccine for my child The programme has been called “non-urgent” and officials are keen for parents and carers, as well as children, to be given as much information as possible about the vaccine. vw,vw,px, px\"They have acknowledged that it will take some parents time to come to the decision and stressed there would still be an offer of vaccination as children age.– Where will children be given jabs It has not yet been announced where children will be vaccinated but it is now up to the NHS to plan how this will work operationally.At-risk children aged five to  have been able to get vaccinated at their GP surgeries.– How many children will be offered the jab There are an estimated . million five to -year-olds in the UK.Some of these will have already been offered the chance to have a vaccinethey are in vulnerable groups.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645020787354.jpg--covid_19___wed_16th_february_figures.jpg?1645020787000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220216newscovid 19 wed 16th february figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

Mitigations have included advice for post-primary pupils to wear face coverings at all times when inside school buildings and for schools to introduce one-way systems.“We will be writing out to schools in the coming days in relation to any impact this may have on the department’s current Covid guidance,” the department said.But the timing of the removal of restrictions, while schools are on half-term break, means head teachers have been left in the dark on what will be expected when they .“We just don’t knowcoronavirus mitigations will be in place,” said Graham Gault, interim director of the National Association of Head Teachers.“Principals have been left trying their best to address the concerns of pupils, parents and staff while we again wait for guidance from the Department of Education.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “While the lting of restrictions in wider society is celebrated, the truth for schools is that they will continue to mitigate against coronavirus in order to keep as many children and staff in school as possible. Schools will definitely not be back to normal next week.“This is yet another school break which is tinted by the fact that school leaders don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark. We have advised our members to always err on the side of safety.”One of the main concerns is that the removal of restrictions in society will lead to a sharp increase in Covid cases, which in turn will lead to further problems with staff absent from the classroom.“The great fear among school leaders is that the lting of restrictions will further increase the crisis of trying to find available staff and keep schools open,” said Mr Gault.“There are many across our schools feeling a bit of trepidation at what increased community transmission might mean for keeping schools open. What we need is clear guidance from the minister so we can prepare for what will be asked of us.”While the number of reported Covid cases among school pupils in the first week of February fell to just over ,, the figures over a -day period, since schools ed after Christmas, have shown a signicant rise in positive cases.Related topicsDepartment of EducationDepartment of HealthMore On Department of EducationTeachers ‘ready to strike’ after rejecting pay offer PremiumDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to five PremiumDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education Bill PremiumViewpointOpinionDelays in our court system must be fixedMost ReadCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two monthsWatch: PSNI perform ‘tactical stop’ on vehicle after night of anti-social behaviour in west BelfastStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest EducationTeachers ‘ready to strike’ after rejecting pay offerDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to fiveDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education BillViewpointOpinionProgress is possible in education systemLatestEnding free Covid testing would be a mistake, Sir Keir Starmer saysTruckers protesting in Canada end last US border blockadeTom Daley battles the elements during day three of Comic Relief challengeCharles ‘happy’ to help police probe into ‘cash-for-honours’ allegationsAndrew keeps dukedom and naval rank after sex assault lawsuit settlement,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Management Side will now take time to consider how the matter should be progressed before engaging again with NITC.”NASUWT confirmed the offer had been rejected by % of its members, not accepting that the deal for  to  proposed by employers was a .% pay increase.The highest rise would be for newly qualied teachers as under the proposals a new teacher’s starting salary would rise to £, from about £, with a newly qualied teacher seeing their gross salary increase by .% from September  with no increase in September .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Unions claim that most teachers would receive much smaller increases over two years and that the figure of .% presented by the employers included the normal incremental pay progression teachers were due to get anyway.“The anger felt by the profession could not be more stark with the vast majority of members saying they were prepared to take industrial action over the offer, with % prepared to take action short of strike action and % prepared to take strike action,” the NASUWT said.“The vast majority of NASUWT members also expressed concerns about the failure of the Department of Education and the employers to deliver on the  Agreement, with % saying that their workload had increased signicantly in the last two years.“And in a sign of the retention challenges facing the profession, % said they were seriously considering leaving teaching.Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT General Secretary added: “This pay offer has come after months and months of delay and represents a further damaging real-terms cut to teachers’ salaries at a time of surging inflation and a deepening cost of living crisis.“Members are clear that they are prepared to take actionthe Minister does not deliver a substantially better deal which addresses teachers’ concerns on pay and workload.”Justin McCamphill, NASUWT National Official Northern Ireland, said the “derisory” offer is “damaging the morale of the profession. It will only serve to make the recruitment and retention of teachers harder at a time when they are desperately needed.”The Northern Ireland Teachers’ Councilhad submitted a pay claim for % for  to  and has called on the Department to urgently make a new offer “which reflects the current inflationary environment.”School leaders’ union NAHT has called for further negotiations after % of NAHT members in Northern Ireland also voted to turn down the offer.Graham Gault, Interim Director for NAHT NI, said: “Having endured cumulative real-terms pay decreases worth % over the last decade, school leaders have made their opinions on the Department’s recent pay offer clear through our democratic processes. A basic cost-of-living increase for teachers and school leaders was requested through the NITC , but the offer has fallen well short.“We believe that genuine attempts to resolve this issue can result in an acceptable settlement and are determined to do all that we can to avoid any escalation to a formal pay dispute.”The chair of the Irish National Teachers’ OrganisationNorthern Committee, Ms Marie O’Shea added: “The latest offer made by the management side to the unions for a cost-of-living increase in the   year falls signicantly short of both our expectations and that of our members.“For any offer to be acceptable to our membership, it must reflect the ongoing efforts by our members who, during the Covid- pandemic, ensured that the vital routine of the education system, remained working effectively for the children and young people in their care. Any award offered to teachers needs to reflect this and offset the effects of the rising inflation we are currently experiencing.”“We remain available to discuss these matters with them constructively and hope they will approach this issue with a more positive and practical attitude than this offer would suggest they have brought to the issue of teachers’ pay to date.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationMichelle McIlveenMore On Department of Education PremiumSchool leaders ‘don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark’ after curb removals PremiumDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to five PremiumDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education Bill PremiumViewpointOpinionDelays in our court system must be fixedMost ReadCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two monthsWatch: PSNI perform ‘tactical stop’ on vehicle after night of anti-social behaviour in west BelfastStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest EducationSchool leaders ‘don’t have guidance and are having to make decisions in the dark’ after curb removalsDebate on issue of integrated education has never been higher, says campaignerMLAs back Bill to defer school starting age for some children from four to fiveDUP confirms its opposition to Integrated Education BillViewpointOpinionProgress is possible in education systemLatestEnding free Covid testing would be a mistake, Sir Keir Starmer saysTruckers protesting in Canada end last US border blockadeTom Daley battles the elements during day three of Comic Relief challengeCharles ‘happy’ to help police probe into ‘cash-for-honours’ allegationsAndrew keeps dukedom and naval rank after sex assault lawsuit settlement,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

by the expert advice.This announcement by the JCVI underlines the important role that the Covid- vaccines plays in protecting people of all ages and has only been taken after rigorous assessment of both safety and effectiveness.I have asked the PHAto work with thetrusts to put this latest advice into operation and further details will be released shortly.In a statement, the JCVI said: This advice on the offer of vaccination to  to -year-olds who are not in a clinical risk group is considered by JCVI as a one-off pandemic response programme.As the Covid- pandemic moves further towards endemicity in the UK, JCVI will review whether, in the longer term, an offer of vaccination to this, and other paediatric age groups, continues to be advised.Related topicsRobin SwannMore On Robin

Our children spent their first day at home after the closure of schools.That was  days ago.We had all suspected it was coming, having watched images from around the world as the pandemic wave approached our shores.Shielding letters were sent to , of the most vulnerable, telling how they were to go into isolation.March ,  was furlough day as the Government committed to support % of wages for employees.Three days later gatherings of more than two people were banned. It was essential trips only.Thursday, March  saw the start of a weekly ritual as we clapped for carers. Communities made scrubs and masks for front line workers. On a bigger scale, companies were redeploying staff and taking on new workers to help the cause as fears over a lack of PPE rose.Then, at pm on Saturday, March  lockdown officially commenced.We said farewell to work colleagues, socially distanced ourselves from family and friends, and started to embrace a new style of community.Those of us with children became teachers overnight. Our children taught us a thing or two also, with crash courses on Zoom, Facetime and TikTok.The older generation had to embrace the technology the young had grown up with. Hands upyou logged in to a Zoom meeting hiding those pyjama bottoms under the kitchen table Maybe it was just as well for our egos the pubs and nightclubs were closed. Self-styled hair, out of necessity, was perhaps not the way to go.Strange as it may seem, being apart from other people actually brought us closer together.For the older among us, we instantly felt a need to hug our parents as soon as we were told we couldn’t. It would be a shame not to remember that. In a way, we all became heroes of a sort. “Stay at home, save lives,” was the message. We stayed at home, while others manned the front line.Driving around was an eerie experience in those early days — few cars on the road shops shut.And when we went out for a walk to get some exercise we actually heard the birdsong.Weddings were halted. Birthdays went uncelebrated. Holidays put on hold.And in the midst of all the sitting around doing not very much at all, a new vocabulary sprung up: furlough the R-rate PPE self-isolation shielding.Social distancing was no longer the domain of the school disco, where the boys sat on one side and the girls on the other.We all wanted to knowwe were a key worker. There was the unprecedented rolling out of guidelines, restrictions, support services and grants to keep businesses afloat.Confusion reigned: how many could meet in a garden  Where could airplanes take us to, and what did we need to get there  What was a ‘wet’ pub Little by little, the restrictions we were living with eased and chinks of light started to emerge.Cemeteries reopened on April  after a public outcry — the first easing of curbs.Monday, May  saw garden centres reopen, with the promise of more rules being ltedthe downward trend in cases of Covid continued.All eyes were on the R-rate, but the same day saw the first signs of a lockdown breakdown.By the end of the month, with temperatures soaring, thousands headed for the seaside.Still, on May , for the first time since March , no deaths were recorded. Positive signs were emerging, and further lockdown easements saw le edging back, evenit was baby steps.But there were relapses. We were teased with the freedom of the pre-pandemic world, only to have it pulled back from us as new iants, second waves of the virus, kept arriving.Restrictions came, then were eased. But they never went away.For many, particularly in the business world, there has been a heavy price to pay.Some pub doors were shut, never to open again. Even big names such as Debenhams could not survive the pandemic, having battled for years against the growth in online retailing.Then there was the impact on people’s wellbeing.That many died having contracted Covid has been well documented, but lockdown brought with it the extra baggage of isolation. The mental state of people was a constant concern.Sure, it’ll be over by Christmas, we said in . We said the same in .It wouldn’t be this placethe ending of restrictions didn’t bring with it some added confusion and doubt.With the Executive unable to meet due to the lack of a First and Deputy First Minister, the issue became a legal matter.In years to come there’ll be plenty of stories told starting with the words: “Do you remember the time ”Those history books  years from now will be filled with the facts and the figures, the bumps in the road, the scandals of those in public office.But we’ve lived with it all, lived through it all, and come out the other side.We can all see a little more clearly now.The dark clouds have been replaced by that hopeful rainbow we’ve been teased with several times over the past two years.There does come a time when we have to learn to live in the world as it is, as close as we can to the way we did.We might not be quite stepping into the brightest of bright days.Restrictions will change to guidelines and recommendations.There will still be many content to take the precautions they feel they need, and everyone should move forward at their own pace.Hopefully the last two years have taught the majority of us to appreciate the things in our lives that are most important to us — our family and friends.Le moves fast. Hopefully, before long, the darkest days of Covid will be a memory.Being honest, a lot of people had left those memories behind some time ago.But think, too, of those who bring the memory of loved ones lost into a world their parent, husband, we, sister or brother is not there to enjoy beside them.Related topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilNI cinema owner calls on Belfast council to change The Batman’s rating so younger viewers can watch with parentsCall for Belfast City Council to remember Bloody Friday  years onCost sinks council plan to make Belfast public transport free for young people PremiumBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsBelfast City council set to launch legal action over Poots’ port checks moveMost ReadCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two monthsWatch: PSNI perform ‘tactical stop’ on vehicle after night of anti-social behaviour in west BelfastStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest CoronavirusChildren aged  to  in Northern Ireland to be offered Covid- jabMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNI Covid passport scheme was #proportionate and justiable#, judge rulesWatch: Belfast shoppers split over masks as rules replaced with guidanceCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Four deaths and , new casesLatestDuke of York urged to reveal source of funds for civil sex case settlementEnding free Covid testing would be a mistake, Sir Keir Starmer saysTruckers protesting in Canada end last US border blockadeTom Daley battles the elements during day three of Comic Relief challengeCharles ‘happy’ to help police probe into ‘cash-for-honours’ allegations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The inquiry heard that boys who#d just arrived to the home would be warned about McGrath.Chairman, the late Sir Anthony Hart, said sexual abuse had taken place at the home though the inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring.Sir Anthony said: It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.He added: It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.At least  files directly related to the home are #closed# to the public, and in one case the order remains in place until  at the earliest.Around a dozen are closed - either fully or partially - until the mid-s and beyond.The building on Upper Newtownards Road was put on the market in August  for £,. Its owner at the time, Leslie Black, had renamed it Linden House and used it as offices.His company had plans to refurbish the building but in , then First Minister Peter Robinson called for it to be razed, which Mr Black said meant he had to abandon his plan. He instead applied for planning application for  apartments on the site. But that development did not go ahead.Most ReadCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two monthsWatch: PSNI perform ‘tactical stop’ on vehicle after night of anti-social behaviour in west BelfastStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandCinema chain fails in bid to overturn  rating for The BatmanStorm Dudley arrives in UK bringing mph winds and heavy downpoursHargey blasts ‘farcical’ claims of sectarian approach to stadia fundingTeachers reject ‘inadequate’ pay offer amid union strike warningChildren aged  to  in Northern Ireland to be offered Covid- jabLatestEnding free Covid testing would be a mistake, Sir Keir Starmer saysTruckers protesting in Canada end last US border blockadeTom Daley battles the elements during day three of Comic Relief challengeCharles ‘happy’ to help police probe into ‘cash-for-honours’ allegationsAndrew keeps dukedom and naval rank after sex assault lawsuit settlement,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is believed to be one of the largest awards of its kind, with the MoD also accepting liability.Read MoreCatholic woman who left job over alleged harassment by her Army boss to receive more than £, compensationSpeaking to the Belfast , Ms Murray said she was relieved at the decision and was now focused on rebuilding her le.I absolutely dreaded going to work even though I had an immaculate record as a civil servant since I was , she said.“At times I just couldn’t think straight. I thought I had a handle on it by ignoring him but I obviously didn’t. I kept thinking, ‘he’s getting the message, it just needs to stop’. I didn’t approach him at the time about the harassment because I felt I wouldn’t be believed and it would lead to more harassment because I didn’t find him funny.The harassment by the Army captain, who cannot be named for security reasons, took place over a five-month period in , with Ms Murray later retiring due to deteriorating psychiatric condition in .Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The tribunal heard that the captain repeatedly referenced her religion in front of others and had also referred to her as “the big cougar”.In one incident, he was reported to have said: “I need back up, I have an Irish Catholic girl armed and dangerous, come quick, need help.”During an office conversation about a concert, it’s also claimed that he said: “I bet you have tried to steal a cone, that is the Catholic coming out in you.”After starting the complaint process in September , the captain was eventually disciplined and transferred to another military posting.The tribunal awarded Ms Murray around £, to cover injury to feelings, psychiatric injuries, loss of previous earnings and interest. Not due to retire until , compensation for loss of future earnings was calculated in excess of £,.She added: “I’m just so relieved and pleased with the outcome. I feel great because I’m totally vindicated and at long last the truth has come out.”She said the admission of liability from the MoD was particularly important.I didn’t ask for any of this, I had every intention of working until retirement age. Because of what happened to me, my health broke down and I was left with no other option than to go through the process of ill health retirement.“It was just so stressful, it was a horrible feeling. I had confided in a few close friends who knew what I was going through. It was such a hard time.”She said finding the courage to eventually speak up had felt like a major risk at the time.“I was afraid I wouldn’t be taken seriously, especially the cougar comment, she said.“I know a lot of people, even women, can find that funny, but I don’t. He just came out with it, he had been talking about someone looking for me ‘because you’re a big cougar’. I nearly fell off the chair. I just don’t find that funny or acceptable. It was a horrible feeling, the worst thing to say to a woman.“On every occasion that he did say something, I was at my desk typing or doing my admin work. I didn’t ask for this, he came to me to insult me.”Askedshe felt the insults were down to vindictiveness or just immaturity, she replied: “I really don’t know what he was thinking. It just beggars belief what was going through his head. All I wanted was to do my job and head home, but I was absolutely dreading it.Ms Murray also thanked her legal team, solicitor Brian Archer and barrister Michael Potter, for their “total support” throughout the entire process.Most ReadCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandCinema chain fails in bid to overturn  rating for The BatmanStorm Dudley arrives in UK bringing mph winds and heavy downpoursHargey blasts ‘farcical’ claims of sectarian approach to stadia fundingTeachers reject ‘inadequate’ pay offer amid union strike warningChildren aged  to  in Northern Ireland to be offered Covid- jabLatestCovid jabs for five to -year-olds – your questions answeredDuke of York urged to reveal source of funds for civil sex case settlementEnding free Covid testing would be a mistake, Sir Keir Starmer saysTruckers protesting in Canada end last US border blockadeTom Daley battles the elements during day three of Comic Relief challenge,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo credit: Liam McBurney PA WirePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueJim Wells. Photo credit: Liam McBurney PA WireNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailJim Wells has claimed that Queen’s University Belfast should focus on attracting more working class unionists, rather than making it “even more of a cold house” for them.The former DUP politician was responding to proposals from an Irish language group at the university, which would introduce a language residency scheme that would house Irish speaking students together in halls of residence.“The problem that Queen’s has is not attracting Irish speakers to the university, it’s attracting working class Protestant students to even consider Queen’s,” he told BBC Radio Ulster’s Stephen Nolan show.Read MoreQUB Irish language group laugh off Orange Order criticism of student residency schemeLow number of Queen’s University Belfast academics from a Protestant background a ‘cause for concern’Baroness Hoey and Jamie Bryson defend their comments on nationalist ‘domination’“How does this do anything but make Queen’s even more of a cold house for those iniduals who don’t speak Irish, who have no interest in Irish ”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The South Down MLA added that “every one of those Irish speakers is also fluent in English, unlike those many hundreds of Chinese students at Queen’s that have flown over, many of whom may be struggling with English”.“Very bright, able people - they’ve flown over thousands of miles to come here, they#re getting no special treatment, it’s going to the Irish language speakers who are of course totally fluent in English,” he continued.The plans put forward from An Cumann Gaelachgroup at Queen’s have not yet been approved.Similar schemes already exist in other universities in the Republic of Ireland, Wales and Scotland.Former special advisor for the SDLP, Brendan Mulgrew noted that Irish speaking students “won’t be exclusively spending  hours a day, seven days a week, in their halls of residence”.“But it does mean that when they are eating or sitting in halls at night, they’re sharing the language that they’re learning and cherishing,” he said.“It means they learn the language better, they’re living with people who study it. It’s about breaking down barriers and accommodating and facilitating their culture.”Mr Wells believes the Irish language is “not simply an expression of a cultural aspiration” and claimed it is part of an “ongoing political campaign”.“We all know Sinn Fein made it very clear that Irish is crucial to the republican struggle. Irish has allowed itself to be cynically used as a political weapon by one political party.”Mr Mulgrew responded: “Those who see ision in this issue are those who see the Irish language as being isive, and that says more to me about those people, who look for ision.“Can we please move away from pointing the finger at each other’s traditions “I would assume that a lot of these students [living in the residence] would be Irish language students who would be taught in Irish anyway.”Sinn Fein has been contacted for a response to Mr Well’s comments.The proposals have faced further criticism from the TUV, and the Student Orange Society at Queen’s, along with its student and alumni lodge, who issued a joint statement claiming the proposals were encouraging “ision”.Joshua Patterson, Worshipful Master of Queen’s LOL , said that universities should be a shared space between students of dferent political and religious backgrounds but the residency scheme “encourages ision, further isolating those from a Unionist background in University le and wider society.”Responding on Twitter, the Cumann Gaelach group said the inspiration for the scheme had actually been taken from the Orange Order.The message read: “Despite their depressing view on our new scéim chónaithe, when we began plans for a living scheme, one of the first examples we looked at was ‘Croom Elbow’, the Orange Society’s own university living scheme.”Referring to information on Queen’s University LOL  website, the Croom Elbow property is used by the lodge for meetings, events and also by the Orange Societies of both of Ulster’s universities.There are also said to be vacancies for tenants at competitive rates each year open to members of the institution and others.An Cumann Gaelach added: “Everyone owns the language. Our proposed living scheme will be a welcoming environment for all, it will help normalise the language and soften such sharp views.”A Queen’s spokesperson said: “Following requests made to the University Leadership by students and staff, Queen’s is currently considering the development of a residential language scheme that will be available to students studying degrees with languages or a language element offered by the University.This initiative is based on similar programmes currently available in other Universities to help promote and develop a deeper understanding of languages and linguistic ersity in an immersive environment.“Students who apply for this type of accommodation option will be selected in accordance with the eligibility criteria set out in the current University Allocation Policy, and must have already secured an accommodation place.No institutional decision has yet been made on the request, which will follow our standard governance, approval and equality screening processes, following the development of a robust proposal.”Related topicsJim WellsQueen’s UniversityMore On Jim Wells PremiumAllison MorrisOpinionDUP’s Donaldson is gambling with his future and the Union PremiumSam McBrideOpinionPeculiar moves by DUP hint at party spat undermining sea border strategy PremiumAction is clearly needed on climate change, but farmers fear they’ll reap a bitter harvestWatch: ‘I’m taking hit on my own after being ousted in blaze of publicity’, says DUP MLA Jim WellsDUP selection process: How does it all work Most ReadCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two monthsWatch: PSNI perform ‘tactical stop’ on vehicle after night of anti-social behaviour in west BelfastStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandCinema chain fails in bid to overturn  rating for The BatmanStorm Dudley arrives in UK bringing mph winds and heavy downpoursHargey blasts ‘farcical’ claims of sectarian approach to stadia fundingTeachers reject ‘inadequate’ pay offer amid union strike warningChildren aged  to  in Northern Ireland to be offered Covid- jabLatestEnding free Covid testing would be a mistake, Sir Keir Starmer saysTruckers protesting in Canada end last US border blockadeTom Daley battles the elements during day three of Comic Relief challengeCharles ‘happy’ to help police probe into ‘cash-for-honours’ allegationsAndrew keeps dukedom and naval rank after sex assault lawsuit settlement,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Patrick’s sister Charley was their surrogate and they used a donor egg.It was a long and expensive process for the family, with heartache along the way after a first pregnancy ended in miscarriage.

That was something we could only dream of.

She told us her thoughts on it, how her family and her partner felt about it and how it would be for her children.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBaby Wren FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBaby WrenThe couple had considered using an egg donor clinic in Kiev but were encouraged to advertise in a local newspaper.They were stunned when they received a reply after a week, with the donor stipulating the egg should go to a gay couple. They subsequently attended a clinic in Belfast, with all family members having to go through counselling.Patrick said: “It was actually a really good gateway to open up questions that you might not have wanted to ask.“Charley [was] telling her children what way we would do things when she had the baby. “[We were asking], ‘Whatthere’s something wrong the baby  Who would decide what happens ”Jon said the couple were also prepared for facing intrusive questions about who the father of the baby was.“Who would ask that  But I’m sure plenty of people will be thinking it without saying it, so how do you manage people’s expectations ” he asked.Patrick added: “But the way the counsellor put it, why would we tell anyone who Wren’s ‘real’ daddy was before she knew “But it doesn’t matter. We’re both her daddy regardless of what has happened. “There’s loads of dferent ways to make a family.

And a lot of people did ask, ‘Whose sperm did you use ’”Jon added: “It’s a natural reaction, but we can tell people the boundaries about that. I have to say it was nieces and nephews that were the easiest to tell because they just accepted it.”Patrick said that Charley’s then three-year-old daughter was quick to correct anyone who congratulated her mum for becoming pregnant.He explained: “She would turn and say to them, ‘She’s not pregnant. That’s Jon and Patrick’s baby’. Charley would be killing herself laughing.”After the “heart wrenching” pain of losing the first pregnancy, Patrick faced dark timesHe recalled: “I was in turmoil some of the times, but when you look back, it was all just washed away when Wren was here.”When the couple announced the new pregnancy, their families were delighted. Jon said: “I had never seen our parents and siblings cry with that kind of joy — they couldn’t believe it.”The day of Wren’s birth was a “surreal” experience filled with hope but also concern.But they had little reason to worry because after Wren was born just before am, the new family was at home together by dinner time.Jon said: “On that drive home and going into the house, you’re thinking, ‘Right we’re supposed to know how to look after this baby’.“It was a lot to take in, but it was amazing at the same time to know that she was ours.”Jon and Patrick are sharing their parenting story on their Instagram page @dadsjourneyMost ReadCommunity heartbroken after Co Down man Kevin Gregory dies suddenly in UkraineStorm Dudley: Weather warning brought forwardCivil servants set for hybrid working policy in two months‘There’s loads of ways to be a family’: Derry dads make surrogacy historyStephen Nolan explores ‘heart-breaking’ family history in new BBC documentaryTop Videos \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ef .ece AUTOCROP wh badbdececcebfdbc.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police ram car as #Divis Hoods# go on weekend rampage in BelfastPlayVideo: Mask or no mask  Belfast reacts as Covid restrictions are ltedPlay Lidl Ireland investigating incident involving security guards outside busy storeLatest Northern IrelandCinema chain fails in bid to overturn  rating for The BatmanStorm Dudley arrives in UK bringing mph winds and heavy downpoursHargey blasts ‘farcical’ claims of sectarian approach to stadia fundingTeachers reject ‘inadequate’ pay offer amid union strike warningChildren aged  to  in Northern Ireland to be offered Covid- jabLatestDuke of York urged to reveal source of funds for civil sex case settlementEnding free Covid testing would be a mistake, Sir Keir Starmer saysTruckers protesting in Canada end last US border blockadeTom Daley battles the elements during day three of Comic Relief challengeCharles ‘happy’ to help police probe into ‘cash-for-honours’ allegations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In fact it is estimated that % of children in this age group have already had Covid, many with mild or no symptoms at all.But a small number are at serious risk of severe illness requiring hospital admission.The JCVI said that offering vaccines to this age group would “protect this very small number of children from serious illness and hospitalisation” in the event of a future wave of disease.– Did the JCVI examine school absences Yes, it was a tricky debate. In the US some % to % of children took time off school after having a jab due to mild side effects but on the other hand, vaccination could prevent some infections and therefore prevent some children needing to take time off school.The JCVI concluded that the effect of vaccination on the disruption to education was “indeterminate”.– I am still on the fence, should I get the vaccine for my child The programme has been called “non-urgent” and officials are keen for parents and carers, as well as children, to be given as much information as possible about the vaccine.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk a .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fcce-f-f-ad-dea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk a .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fcce-f-f-ad-dea_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk a .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fcce-f-f-ad-dea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk a .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fcce-f-f-ad-dea_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Press Association Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThey have acknowledged that it will take some parents time to come to the decision and stressed there would still be an offer of vaccination as children age.– Where will children be given jabs It has not yet been announced where children will be vaccinated but it is now up to the NHS to plan how this will work operationally.At-risk children aged five to  have been able to get vaccinated at their GP surgeries.– How many children will be offered the jab There are an estimated . million five to -year-olds in the UK.Some of these will have already been offered the chance to have a vaccinethey are in vulnerable groups.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs.

I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment. At long last we are to get these light, he said.After meeting Roads Service officials, Mr Biggerstaff also announced progress on a number of other projects in the Saintfield area.He said the provision of a footpath along Middle Road is to go forward to the Departmentrsquos forward planning section, as well similar provision on the Ballynahinch Road, Saintfield, as far as Ballymaconnell Road.Mr Biggerstaff said he had also been assured that a footpath extension from Lislane Park to the new build on the Listooder Road, taking in the primary school area will ldquodefinitely happen this year.The Ulster Unionist councillor has also asked officials to carry out a study into a serious flooding problem during periods of heavy rain at Carsonstown Road Killybawn Road.NEWCASTLE ndash Down councillor, Mr John Ritchie, has claimed that the Eastern Health Board consultation process is the ldquokiss of death for Mourne House.In a strong address to the Eastern Health Council attacking the closer plan for Mourne House, Mr Ritchie said that in his experience consultation rarely results in a change to such a proposal.Mr Ritchie claimed the unit of management has looked at the Mourne House scenario from a narrow perspective and he voiced concern about the future of the elderly people in the outlying parts of the community.It was the local councillor who asked for the Mourne House issue to be put on the Council agenda for Thursdayrsquos meeting and he dominated the  minute discussion.During his address Mr Ritchie suggested the implementation of a two-year programme to deal with the renovations and the building could then be used as a base for a community care programme.Mr Ritchie explained that Mourne House first came to light in the dying days of the last Eastern Health Board when the policy and planning committee considered a plan for the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management.The proposal included reducing the number of beds to  and developing Mourne House as a base for a community care package with respite care, a  place day centre, and meals on wheels.Mr Ritchie said there were a whole range of suggestions which the Board felt made a ldquovery attraction option.CLOUGH ndash The Presbyterian congregation in Clough held a thanksgiving service on Sunday to bid farewell to their  year-old church hall which is being replaced.The hall which was built in , is being demolished to make way for a new hall which will be officially opened by the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the Rev Rodney Sterritt, in April.The services was conducted by the Rev Robert Craig, church minister, who researched the origins and construction of the hall at the turn of the century.The hymn, psalm and ure reading were the same as those used at the opening service.The ious organisations which used the hall over the years were remembered, including the Scouts and Guides, Boysrsquo and Girlsrsquo Brigades, the Girlsrsquo auxiliary, and the badminton, bowls and table tennis clubs.The congregation also remembered the many services and church socials which were held in the hall.In his address, Mr Craig pointed to the strong links between the current congregation and that of a bygone age.He said many of the original families still reside in the Clough area and belong to the congregation.Mr Craig said the congregation is still industrious and is currently busy erecting and paying for the new hall.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league. We work hard every Tuesday and Thursday night and itrsquos a credit to our manager, Michael Carvill, for the shape hersquos pulled us in to.Kilmore: C Turley, J McCarthy, M Stewart, J Larkin, G Kennedy, B Walsh, J Smyth, N McCarthy , J McKinney, A McGrattan, E McGrattan.Subs: C Magee, M Monan, M Carvill.Yellow cards: C Magee, A McGrattan, J McKinney.Comber: A Topping, M Gibson, L Walker, B Porter, R Whittle, S Moore, B Nelson, S Hanna , D Wilson, M Tumilson, G Keenan.Subs: S Fleck, C Gillan, K Gaw.Yellow cards: S Moore, C Gillan, B Porter, S Hanna..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Knockevin in £75k funding initiative  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special Schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association has unveiled details of an ambitious pound, fundraising initiative.The school has bases in Downpatrick, Dundrum and Castlewellan, with the parent and staff group hoping that the ldquoenchantment project will raise vital funds to purchase essential outdoor play and learning equipment.In addition, some of the pound, will be used to meet school bus running costs and other essential items at Knockevinrsquos three bases.Announcing details of the new fundraising initiative, the parent and staff group said pupils are in need of ious items to help combat social deprivation as a result of the ongoing pandemic.ldquoOur children may not always have the same opportunity for social inclusion as those in mainstream education, but to be able to provide them with an outdoor space they can safely and comfortably enjoy together which is fully accessible and tailored to all their needs would be a dream come true, said a spokesperson for the group.ldquoOur children and young adults are most deserving of this. and, as with all specialist equipment, a large price tag is included and we aim to hold as many fundraising activities and events as possible to ensure that we reach our goal.As Covid restrictions continue to ease, the highly acclaimed special school will be able to hold its th anniversary at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel on September , with entertainment provided by the Booze Bros and Finbarr Keaveney the compere for the evening.ldquoWe are looking forward to getting together again to celebrate all that has been achieved in the past  years.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups. The athletes seemed to have doubled in height compared to the first race of the day and they looked powerful and committed as they loped past with long strides.The two kilometre race was a display of pacing and control with the speed picking up in the last lap.Ollie Robinsonmade sure he held his lead to the line and Amy McCartanran strongly to come first in the girlsrsquo section.Racing completed there was a flurry to clear up before the next shower and many hands made light work.Thanks are due to all the volunteers ndash both those who are involved on the day and those who do the admin behind the scenes. The commitment of the young runnersis highly commendable and the continued backing of McGrady Financial Services is much appreciated.These young folk are the future of our clubs and the sport in general and all those who are facilitating this, know that it is time well spent.The next race is in Tollymore Forest Park on March .

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it.

As we emerge from the pandemic, more people will choose to visit the resort where there are exciting plans in place to provide even more for things for people to do and see.ldquoNewcastle and many parts of the wider district boast some of the most spectacular scenery anywhere in the world and the one thing that people can be assured of when they visit is a warm Irish welcome. ldquoCllr Clarke said that over recent years, investment to overhaul the promenade and the Main Street through the heart of the resort has paid a handsome idend.ldquoWhile the resort enjoys many international visitors, Newcastle is also a top destination for day-trippers which provides the townrsquos economy with a signicant boost and helps safeguard many jobs, he said.ldquoWe have the Mournes, the sea, forest parks, golf courses and nearby Murlough which all add to the great package Newcastle has to offer.ldquoThe calibre of cafes, bars and restaurants are top notch and it is no surprise that the resort is noted for the high level of its hospitality services. These all add to the experience that the town provides.Cllr Clarke said while Covid had a major impact on the tourism industry, with spring and summer on the horizon, Newcastle will be ready to offer the warm welcome to visitors that the resort is noted for.In addition, he said the fact that Newcastle is regarded as one of the top friendliest visitor destinations is testament to the efforts of so many people, from tourism providers to local businesses and residents to a raft of statutory organisations, including Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoIt is tremendous that the collective efforts and ard work of so many people has been rewarded with the people who come to Newcastle voting it one of the most friendliest places they have visited..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Owl.jpg","title":"Rare barn owls return to  nest at Finnebrogue estate  ","story":"RARE and vulnerable barn owls have ed to nest at the Finnebrogue estate, near Downpatrick.There are believed to be fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls in Northern Ireland, but their population has been given a much-needed boost with the discovery of a new nest site.The Finnebrogue estate is nestled along the banks of the Quoile river with an expanse of  acres of mixed farm land with half given over to the environment.In January last year, bird boxes were placed around the farm in the hope of attracting breeding barn owls over the winter.Following the use of thermal imaging in April, a pair were discovered nesting in one of the boxes.Commenting on the exciting find, Mark Sandford, Finnebrogue farm manager, said: ldquoHaving only placed nesting boxes up in , it took no time for a barn owl pair to settle. This is testament to our land management, meaning there is ample food resources available for them.He continued: ldquoBarn owl diet consists of mainly wood mice, pygmy shrews and young rats, which in turn are attracted to the estatersquos mature woodland and areas of grass scrubland which regularly throw out grain to encourage a good population of rodents.ldquoWe hope that these barn owls will keep coming back year after year and continue to add vital numbers to our small and vulnerable Northern Irish population.Mark is receiving support from Ulster Wildle through their barn owl conservation work.Katy Bell, Senior Conservation Officer, explains why this pair is so important.ldquo has been a dficult year for our already struggling barn owl population. The wet and extremely hot weather meant that most of our barn owl nest sites failed, so we were thrilled to hear this news.ldquoLuckily, this pair couldnrsquot have chosen a more sympathetic farm to set up home with wild bird cover, meadows and mature hedgerows providing plentul foraging habitat and food for barn owls to thrive.She continued: ldquoWith fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, farmers and landowners play a key role in securing their future.ldquoBy working together, we can help protect precious nest sites, monitor these beautul birds and provide help and advice on owl-friendly farming.The chicks were kindly ringed by David Galbraith, a licenced volunteer ringer from the British Trust for Ornithology .This will generate important information on the birdsrsquo survival, productivity and movement - and is non-invasive as the birds remain sleepy during the process.Barn owls are legally protected and can be sensitive to disturbance, soyou find a nest site, please leave it alone and get in touch with Ulster Wildle.Tell-tale signs to look for include distinctive whitewash pings, feathers and regurgitated pellets of bones and fur.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13227668.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I don’t know how long I stayed there but I can honestly say that I didn’t see any RUC. To me Mr Donaldson’s letter reeks of whataboutery in a reverse psychological way. At a time when the RUC has been put in the gutterby the ombudsman’s reportI think he attempts to shine a halo of light on a completely discredited force at the expense of the McGurk’s atrocity and it’s victims. Let’s not forget that the RUC were quick to discredit the victims even before they were identied. The RUC lied when it stated that the bomb was inside the bar. The RUC victimised the victims. Mr Donaldson reveals that the RUC officer brought home pictures of the dead of our loved ones and left them in an unsecure place to be found by anyone, in this case a child, which begs the question who  shared these images and for what purpose  Again remember that the RUC was spreading lies about our loved ones at this time. Recently we have learned of security force members using the personal items from victims of Ballymurphy as spoils of war. We also know of the montages of innocent people have in the past been over to paramilitaries by the security forces. Why were pictures of my mother Kathleen and the other victims in the house of the policeman to whom Mr Donaldson refers  What  did he and his colleagues bring home  Does this still happen today  Finally I would ask Mr Donaldson that in any future reference to victims that he please study the circumstances of their deaths .Sam Irvine, Belfast BTFty years ago Northern Ireland was in the early phase of three decades of killings that never needed to happen——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Mr Murphy says it is an insult to describe the discrepancy as sectarian but it is not surprising that many football fans will interpret the dferent treatment in that way, particularly when the party defending the stadium decision is so reliably tribal and so reliably opposed to proposals that unionist politicians hold dear.It is appalling that the £ million earmarked for sub-regional stadia is not progressing.It is a huge setback for clubs such as Coleraine FC, which have waited so patiently for improvements, and which had drawn up feasible plans for them.As the IFA CEO Patrick Nelson has said see our back page, local football needs investment.Mr Nelson points out that the sub-regional funding was included in the  New Decade New Approach deal to restore Stormont.The only part of that deal that a Conservative and Unionist government intends to rush through is the part that Sinn Fein demands, relating to the gaelic language.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It cannot be reformed it must go. Any unionists who do not believe me, need only look at the nationalist position on the protocol. They wholeheartedly support it because it promotes a united Ireland and a broken United Kingdom. Second, vocally declare their opposition to it. Indeed, all pro-unionists need to shout their opposition from the roof tops. And third, cooperate with other unionist parties to ensure unionism wins a thumping majority of seats in the May elections.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Abandoning those elections in protest against the protocol is not an option. Nationalists and Westminster would both sell such a move as unionism accepting it has lost popular support. They would take the opportunity to set the protocol in stone. Indeed, anything short of a thumping victory for unionism would be similarly promoted. Votes cast for nationalist parties in May will be sold as votes for the protocol. If the nationalists win there will be no ditching or even ying the protocol. It will have been confirmed. There is meant to be a vote on the protocol in Stormont in . There is only one poll that matters, the forthcoming elections. The poll for and against the protocol is already upon us. If nationalists win now, the poll in  will be academic. A victory for nationalism will result in their next pushing for a border poll. In their shoes that is exactly what I would do. I would cite victory as proof that there is now popular support for a united Ireland. There is only one policy which matters in the May elections: what is your position on the protocol  Everything  is of subsidiary importance right now. And anything less than total opposition to it would takes us closer to a border poll and a united Ireland. We are where we are because successive British governments, particularly the current administration, have turned their back on Northern Ireland. When it came to Brexit, Boris Johnson had no qualms about throwing the province under a bus to deliver his faux exit from the EU. Even now, after more than a year of damage from the Irish Sea border, Johnson refuses to acknowledge the constitutional threat posed by the Protocol. He says it is a technical problem one that could be resolved by the EU being pragmatic. His naivety is deliberate and disingenuous. He does not want to face the problem and he does not need to face it. The thing which matters most to Johnson is remaining in office and there are no votes for him in Northern Ireland. He will not be coming to our rescue. The responsibility to save our union falls to pro-unionists in Northern Ireland and their leaders.Make no mistake,unionist parties do not win big in May, we will face a border poll as soon as this year. No unionist party could surely want such a thing. Now is therefore no time for weakness or party politics. Unionist parties must set aside their dferences and work in union for our union. We need a Grand Alliance of Unionism. Doug Beattie, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister carry the hopes and expectations of pro-unionists not just in Northern Island but across the British Isles.• Ben Habib is a former Brexit Party MEP——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We opened in the middle of things before a second lockdown – it was a harsh time to open a shop but hopefully it’s going back to normal now.”Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy said he wanted to get to a position where there was no need for any Covid- guidance.“We look forward to a time that we can remove all restrictions, and all guidance becomes a thing of the past,” he said yesterday.“But the pandemic is still going on, there are still people dying, there’s still people contracting the virus. And so there has to be a degree of caution in relation to that.”Health Minister Robin Swann confirmed on Monday that all legal restrictions in the Province would be replaced by guidance from yesterday.Mr Swann, who tested positive for coronavirus on Sunday, was advised by the attorney general last week on the potential legal complications of him replacing Covid regulations with guidance amid the current political crisis in the Province.But the lting of Covid- legal restrictions should not be viewed as “freedom day”, Stormont’s chief scientic adviser said yesterday.Professor Ian Young urged people to continue to wear face masks in certain public settings, even though it will no longer be a legal requirement.“When something changes from regulation to guidance it doesn’t mean that our behaviours need to change, or indeed that they should change,” Prof Young said.“I think most of our population are acutely aware of the dangers and risks which Covid has brought, the huge harms that have been done.“We all want people to get back to living as normally as possible – wearing a face covering in appropriate settings doesn’t stop that.”He added: “I would absolutely not use the term ‘freedom day’. This is not freedom day.”Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill, meanwhile, welcomed the change.“After nearly two long years, the hospitality industry will be relieved that they can begin to trade without pandemic restrictions limiting the viability of their businesses,” he said.“We must have full focus on rebuilding consumer confidence and supporting the hospitality industry as a key driver for the wider economy.”He continued: “The lting of the remaining restrictions, including mandatory passes at nightclubs and recording customer details, will hopefully signal a major turning point for the industry and see theof the thriving industry we once had which contributed over £bn annually to the local economy. “We want to see local customers ing and visitors from where with the opening of greater tourism opportunities. That buzz has been missed. “Now, attention must turn to the plan of action on how to best rebuild and revitalise the industry to ensure that it s to its former position as a signicant employer and economic generator. “Through a dedicated hospitality strategy, innovative plans and actions can be implemented which will help hospitality regrow, and help create further jobs and opportunities for the sector as we emerge from the pandemic.”Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said: “We can now reopen our economy and accelerate the recovery of our High Streets.“However, we are disappointed that the statement does not include a clear commitment toto the workplace. Safely reopening offices and workplaces is not only vital to boost footfall for our high streets, but also for our economy and ing our society to normal.”He added: “Northern Ireland needs to catch up with other parts of the UK with its -to-workplace message.“Retail NI want to see the Executive establish a working group to produce a clear and co-ordinated plan for the safe and timelyof public and private sector staff.”Northern IrelandConor MurphyRobin SwannBelfastColin Neill  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularThis is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea borderStorm warnings for Northern Ireland now include heavy snowNorthern Ireland Protocol could see a wide range of new regulations imposed on NI, says committee of MPsFormer UUP chairman asks when party ‘moved away’ from DUP-TUV position on transfer votes ‘Chilling warning that stopped me selling explosives to the IRA’ - ex-gangster John Lawson tells how he escaped a le of brutality and crimeMost PopularHow to boost your home wi signal: the best wi router extenders  from BT, Netgear, Orbi, and Amazon best weighted blankets  for adults and kids: from Argos, Amazon, Wayfair and LakelandMS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale nowBest sports bras UK : best high support, shock-absorbing exercise bras, from Lululemon, Freya, and NikeBest robot vacuum cleaner UK : top cleaners for pet hair and more from Dyson to Shark                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

What it will do is regenerate the area of Coleraine which is an area of deprivation – that’s not me saying that, that is the statistics that are produced for Northern Ireland.”He added: “What we were looking for through the Sub Regional Stadia Programme was to create a North West Regional Stadium with state of the art training facilities and a community hub.“If you’re a team, say from Scotland, who doesn’t want to be going to Spain for pre-season training on an annual basis, Coleraine is right on your doorstep. There’s some great golf courses for a bit of rest and relaxation, great hotels – it all makes sense.”He said: “It was incredibly disappointing but not unexpected when the minister made the announcement.“I sincerely hope that we as a footballing family all come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“I would also strongly support engaging with the Gaelic community, I believe both communities need the facilities.“My thinking is that all the sporting communities should come together and put pressure on the minister to reverse her judgement.“It’s very disappointing that sport finds itself embroiled in a political situation, there are undoubtedly those who are using this is a political weapon, all they’re doing is depriving the youth and prosperity of all of society by their shortsightedness.”He added: “We’re proceeding with all our plans and hopefully further down the line after the election when there’s new candidates in, the money can be resurrected.”Intermediate club Bangor FC planned to use funding from the Department for Communities ill-fated stadia programme as part of the club’s push toto the Premiership.Largely based on cash from Deirdre Hargey’s department, the club – who have been absent from Northern Ireland’s top ision for more than  years – submitted a planning application for a new -seater grandstand and community hub.Bangor FC Chairman Graham Bailie said: “We are extremely disappointed about the news of the funding package for football stadia in Northern Ireland being shelved. “These funds were set to transform football club facilities across Northern Ireland. “A new modern grandstand and community hub are an essential step in the evolution of our plans to bring Premiership football back to Bangor FC. “Our ambition is to continue making progress on the pitch, and supporting the local community off it. “That is why we included a community hub at the heart of this project. “However, it was always dependent on securing a combination of public funds, from the Sub Regional Stadia Programme, and private investment opportunities.” He said the club now needs an answer to the question of whether the funding will now be available in the budget which spans  to .

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe law changes on Monday, March , removing the legal defence of reasonable punishment and opening the possibility for anyone who smacks a child to be prosecuted for assault.The Welsh Government passed the law change two years ago, seeing off opposition in the Senedd to win a vote - on what was described as a “landmark day for children in Wales”The government said the law change would help “protect children and their rights, and give them the best start in le”. By banning smacking, ministers argue children in Wales are now given the same protections from assault as adults.Physical punishmentis \"not a necessary part of disciplining children\" and \"doesn’t help children learn about self-control or appropriate behaviour\", the Welsh Government advises, adding that such punishments can hurt children and give them the message violence is an \"appropriate response to strong feelings\".The new law will apply to everyone in Wales, including visitors, and £. million is being invested in parenting support services.Advice and support for parents and s is available on the Welsh Government’s Give It Time website https:gov.wales parenting-give-it-time.Children’s charities like Barnardo’s Cymru and the NSPCC have supported the law change, but the ban has not been welcomed universally.As well as some opposition in the Senedd, mainly from the Welsh Conservatives, a campaign group called Be Reasonable argued the move would “inevitably catch ordinary, loving parents and turn them into criminals”, and their petition against the government’s proposals collected nearly , signatures in Wales.And the Welsh Government’s own studies suggest members of the public are equally ided over the issue.Researchers carried out three surveys between  and  to gauge public opinion on banning the physical punishment of children..removeWhile support for a smacking ban grew in , research shows that level fell slightly a year later. If anything, people’s opinions have become less rigid, with more people in  than in previous years saying they would need more information before deciding whether they agreed with the law change.Among those members of the public who said they supported a smacking ban in the last survey, more than one-thirdsaid they did not agree generally with the physical punishment of children.Other common reasons for supporting the ban included the belief there were other good forms of ensuring good behaviour and discipline , and the belief smacking was abuse, or could lead to abuse .Meanwhile, one in four peoplewho said they opposed the smacking ban in the most recent survey did so because they believed physical punishment was needed to control behaviour, the discipline a child, to teach respect or to show boundaries.Other common reasons for opposing the law change included the belief smacking doesn’t do any harm– including cases when people said it hadn’t done themselves or their own children any harm – and that smacking was OKit was a reasonable punishment and doesn’t go too far.Not everyone who smacks a child from March  will be automatically prosecuted. Wales four police forces have been encouraged to consider a \"rehabilitative alternative to prosecution\"this is more appropriate.\"In cases where the police decide it is appropriate to offer an out of court disposal, there will be an option of tailored parenting support to encourage positive parenting techniques and help avoid re-offending,\" the government has advised.Those parenting support schemes will be offered by councils. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have been able to go above and beyond to provide Welsh households with more help in paying bills, heating homes and putting food on the table..remove“In total we are more than doubling the equivalent support provided by the UK Government for those who need it the most, reflecting our priority of creating a fairer Wales in which no-one is left behind.”Earlier this month, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £ of support for households across England to deal with rising energy bills over the year from April .Some £ of the support will take the form of a council tax rebate for all ratepayers in council tax bands A to D.The Treasury also announced that devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would be given a total of £ million extra funding to carry out the same measure.Last week Wales’ first minister Mark Drakeford said there was “no extra money for Wales” from the Treasury to provide the rebate.His claim came after the UK Government’s Welsh secretary accused the devolved Welsh Government of leaving its taxpayers “unclear” about whether they would be getting a £ council tax rebate to help with energy bills.Jane Hutt, minister for social justice in Wales, said: “The funding we are announcing today will ensure more people get more support, in what are challenging circumstances for so many families in Wales.“As bills rise, prices go up and wages are stretched we know people will need help, that’s why I’ve convened a Wales-wide Cost of Living Summit on Thursday  February, with over  participants from a wide range of social partners and third sector organisations across Wales to discuss the crisis and the proactive actions we can take to support people across Wales.“Addressing the cost-of-living crisis remains a crucial priority for this Government and we will continue to consider all the options available to us.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWales’ minister for finance and local government, Rebecca Evans, said the government is “more than doubling the equivalent support provided by the UK Government” for those most in need, as it aims to ensure “no-one is left behind”.The Welsh Government has announced what it described as a package of expanded measures to help people amid rising prices, including a £ cost-of-living payment to be paid as soon as possible and an extra £ for low-income households through the winter fuel payment next winter.The £ payment will be available to all households who live in properties in council tax bands A-D, as well as those in receipt of the Council Tax Reduction Scheme in all bands.The devolved government said it will be working with local authorities to provide more detail about how the scheme will operate and will start making payments as soon as possible.It said a further £ million will be made available as a discretionary fund, allowing councils to use their local knowledge to help households who might be struggling.The government added that in - more than £ million will be provided to strengthen other schemes that help people meet the rising costs of living.More funds will be allocated through the discretionary assistance fund – which helps people pay for essential costs such as food, electricity, clothing and emergency travel – and the winter fuel support scheme, which will deliver an additional £ later this year to hundreds of thousands of low-income households, the government said.Ms Evans, of Welsh Labour, said: “People are facing a very real cost-of-living crisis and urgent, meaningful action is required.“The Chancellor’s offer at the start of the month fell short of what people needed. We have been able to go above and beyond to provide Welsh households with more help in paying bills, heating homes and putting food on the table..remove“In total we are more than doubling the equivalent support provided by the UK Government for those who need it the most, reflecting our priority of creating a fairer Wales in which no-one is left behind.”Earlier this month, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £ of support for households across England to deal with rising energy bills over the year from April .Some £ of the support will take the form of a council tax rebate for all ratepayers in council tax bands A to D.The Treasury also announced that devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would be given a total of £ million extra funding to carry out the same measure.Last week Wales’ first minister Mark Drakeford said there was “no extra money for Wales” from the Treasury to provide the rebate.His claim came after the UK Government’s Welsh secretary accused the devolved Welsh Government of leaving its taxpayers “unclear” about whether they would be getting a £ council tax rebate to help with energy bills.Jane Hutt, minister for social justice in Wales, said: “The funding we are announcing today will ensure more people get more support, in what are challenging circumstances for so many families in Wales.“As bills rise, prices go up and wages are stretched we know people will need help, that’s why I’ve convened a Wales-wide Cost of Living Summit on Thursday  February, with over  participants from a wide range of social partners and third sector organisations across Wales to discuss the crisis and the proactive actions we can take to support people across Wales.“Addressing the cost-of-living crisis remains a crucial priority for this Government and we will continue to consider all the options available to us.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a letter to UK immigration minister Kevin Foster, representatives of the three devolved administrations claimed that processes for skilled workers looking to come to Britain were “inflexible, costly and bureaucratic” and had also served to “exclude many of the key workers that we need, many of whom have been crucial during the Covid- pandemic”.The letter, from Wales social justice minister, Jane Hutt, Scottish Europe minister, Neil Gray, and Northern Ireland economy minister, Gordon Lyons, states there are “severe labour and skills shortages” in all four nations of the UK.But they claim the UK Government has failed to “work constructively” with the devolved administrations to try to tackle the problem.The Welsh, Scottish, and Northern Irish politicians insisted the Home Office should “immediately reintroduce” regular four-way meetings where such issues can be discussed.They told Mr Foster: “The UK Government has said it wants the immigration system to work for all parts of the UK.“Without a commitment to regular and meaningful engagement with the devolved governments, this is simply not possible.”UK ministers were also urged to “immediately review the immigration skills and health surcharges and reduce additional fees”, with Governments in Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast arguing these can be an “insurmountable barrier for both workers and employers”.They added: “As it stands, the UK has one of the most costly immigration systems and this cannot continueit is to be an attractive destination for global talent moving forward.”Ms Hutt, Mr Gray, and Mr Lyons repeated calls for the devolved administrations to be given a formal role in deciding which occupations there is a shortage of in their nations, in a bid to make it easier to recruit overseas workers to these posts..remove“We call upon the UK Government to act urgently,” they said.The three ministers told Mr Foster it was critical that their administrations are involved in the issue, arguing: “Migration is a cross-cutting policy area affecting many aspects of devolved competency including the economy, housing, healthcare and the delivery of local services.”However they claimed: “Sadly in spite of our efforts, the UK Government has consistently failed to consult, collaborate, or work constructively with the devolved Governments on any changes pertaining to the immigration system.“This is despite the severe labour and skills shortages faced across all four nations which can largely be attributed to the excessively restrictive UK immigration system.”They added: “We are doing everything within our respective powers to ensure that the needs of businesses are met, but the action we take must be supplemented by immediate changes to the immigration system in order to quickly access the labour and skills our nations need to survive the current crisis.”A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: “Our points-based immigration system is focused on talent and skills and makes it much easier for the brightest and best to live and study in the UK.“We continue to engage with the devolved administrations on immigration policies but it is important that employers make long term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere are the answers to some of the key questions about jabs for younger children.– What is the latest The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas advised that healthy children aged five to  should be offered a Covid- vaccine on a “non-urgent” basis.The recommendation has been accepted by ministers across the UK and jabs are expected to be rolled out from April in England.– I thought jabs were approved for use in five to -year-olds in December The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyannounced in December that a special “paediatric formulation” of the Pfizer BioNtech Covid- vaccine was safe for use among children aged five to .The JCVI then said that the vaccine could be offered to “at risk” children in this age group, but reserved its decision on wider use among healthy children in this age bracket until now.– Can you tell me more about this “paediatric formulation” Children aged five to  will be offered a much lower dose of the vaccine – lower than that offered to adults or children aged  and over. vw,vw,px, px\"They will be offered a  micrograms dose compared with  micrograms.Children will be given two doses,  weeks apart.– Are there any side effects Both data from the clinical trials and real-world experience shows that younger children are less likely to report side effects compared to children aged  and over and young adults.The MHRA has also been monitoring whether there have been side effects among at-risk children who are already receiving the jab.It said the “overwhelming majority” of side effects reported were mild and “self-resolving” such as fever, headache or sore arms.The NHS will make a non-urgent offer of the #COVID vaccine to all children aged - in England during April.This follows new advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .More info 🔽— Department of Health and Social CareFebruary , A JCVI official said severe adverse reactions were “extremely, extremely rare”.Officials examined lots of data, including information from the US where millions of children aged five to  have been vaccinated. The jab has also been on offer to this age group in a number of countries around the world including Ireland, Canada and Israel.One MHRA official said that parents could be reassured that “this is a very safe vaccine”.– Are children not at low risk from Covid Yes, the vast majority of children are at low risk from Covid-. In fact it is estimated that % of children in this age group have already had Covid, many with mild or no symptoms at all.But a small number are at serious risk of severe illness requiring hospital admission.The JCVI said that offering vaccines to this age group would “protect this very small number of children from serious illness and hospitalisation” in the event of a future wave of disease.– Did the JCVI examine school absences Yes, it was a tricky debate. In the US some % to % of children took time off school after having a jab due to mild side effects but on the other hand, vaccination could prevent some infections and therefore prevent some children needing to take time off school.The JCVI concluded that the effect of vaccination on the disruption to education was “indeterminate”.– I am still on the fence, should I get the vaccine for my child The programme has been called “non-urgent” and officials are keen for parents and carers, as well as children, to be given as much information as possible about the vaccine. vw,vw,px, px\"They have acknowledged that it will take some parents time to come to the decision and stressed there would still be an offer of vaccination as children age.– Where will children be given jabs It has not yet been announced where children will be vaccinated but it is now up to the NHS to plan how this will work operationally.At-risk children aged five to  have been able to get vaccinated at their GP surgeries.– How many children will be offered the jab There are an estimated . million five to -year-olds in the UK.Some of these will have already been offered the chance to have a vaccinethey are in vulnerable groups..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Covid jabs for five to -year-olds  u your questions answered article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_beebedaeecdbbc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbfaecdb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1644849796034.jpg--covid_19___mon_14th_february_figures.jpg?164484979600","title":"covid  mon th february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

They are to be replaced by guidance after Mr Swann obtained support for the move from his fellow ministers. Social distancing, regulations on the number people allowed in homes and the COVID passport scheme are also gone. There are only a small number of restrictions left in place, said Mr Swann, who is isolating after testing positive for coronavirus, in his statement to the Assembly. In light of the current situation, and remembering the commitment that restrictions would only be in place as long as they are needed, I have decided that those remaining measures should no longer be set out in regulations. Instead, they should be placed in guidance to be followed by the public. I shall therefore be making an order on Tuesday, February  revoking the remaining restrictions and face-covering regulations. The relevant guidance will be updated.” He added that the changes do “not mean that Covid- has gone away or that we as a community are safe from its harm”. Mr Swann continued, “It is vitally important that we continue to observe the sensible measures we have all learnt to protect ourselves and others. Even with these powers in place however, it would almost certainly be impossible to introduce new restrictions in the absence of an Executive.
