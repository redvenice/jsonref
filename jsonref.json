Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle (pictured right last week) is recovering from heart surgery and will now not attend the wedding  Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria    The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 The actress also appeared to reject criticism by her siblings that she had failed to do enough to support the reclusive Thomas Markle, saying she had \u0027always cared\u0027 for him. However, her mother, Doria Ragland, who will accompany her to the chapel and who is due to meet the Queen today, is tipped for the role. Miss Markle\u0027s future father-in-law, Prince Charles, and her closest male friend, Soho House director Markus Anderson, have also been mooted.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.    The Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Excitement ahead of the wedding is reaching fever pitch today as Americans and Brits pose outside Windsor Castle      It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.          Police marksmen on the ground and on rooftops have to do \u0027whatever it takes\u0027 to keep people safe tomorrowIn return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.

Everyone will already know most of what to expect as the order of service is being released at midnight on Friday.1pmThe newlyweds will emerge about an hour later at the West Steps of the Chapel. They will be waved off on their carriage procession through Windsor by members of both families. The congregation will file out of the chapel to see the newlyweds leave before heading to St George’s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.The carriage procession through the streets of Windsor is expected to take about 25 minutes.7pmThe reception is not being televised and neither is the evening reception at Frogmore House, but viewers will get another glimpse of the royal couple when they leave Windsor Castle at 7pm for the evening do, which is hosted by the Prince of Wales.       Prince Charles, who walked family friend Alexandra Knatchbull down the aisle at her wedding in 2016, will step in for Thomas Markle, it was announced this morningThe Prince of Wales is no stranger to walking down non-relations down the aisle.He gave away Princess Diana\u0027s goddaughter Alexandra Knatchbull at her wedding to Thomas Hooper in 2016, as her own father looked on.At the time some speculated that Lord Brabourne, a close friend of the Prince and the grandson of Earl Mountbatten, was in poor health.Others suspected strained relations between Alexandra, goddaughter of Princess Diana, and her father could go some way towards explaining why a bride from one of Britain’s most established families chose to break with tradition.In 2010 Norton Knatchbull, the eighth Baron Brabourne, abandoned his 31-year marriage to run away to Nassau in the Bahamas with fashion designer Jeannie Nuttall.When this relationship ended in 2014 and he returned to the historic estate –where Noel Coward played the piano at weekend house parties – he was banished from the house to live in a converted barn.                                                       Snipers on the streets: Security forces build a £30MILLION taxpayer-funded ring of steel around Windsor as 100,000 superfans descend on the town for Harry and Meghan\u0027s big daySnipers are on rooftops today with soldiers and armed police patrolling the streets below as a £30million ring of steel today surrounds Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding.Police, the Army and undercover members of the security services are ready \u0027do whatever is necessary\u0027 to prevent any attack on Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day, including shooting to kill.The 2.6-mile route the couple will travel from St George\u0027s Chapel to Windsor Castle is lined with sharpshooters on top of buildings and other vantage points. Specialist teams are also patrolling the Thames.Police and soldiers carrying automatic weapons will also line the streets ready to fire if necessary and are already patrolling the roads, which have crash barriers used to stop vehicle-based terror attacks.With the UK\u0027s terror threat level at severe the cost of security for the first major royal wedding since 2011 is expected to reach up to £30million and the bill will be picked up by the taxpayer.It is Thames Valley Police\u0027s biggest ever operation and they are relying heavily on Scotland Yard and MI5 for support.It came as superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrow.              Police teams are even patrolling Windsor along the Thames today in an  extraordinary security operation ahead of the royal wedding    Police spotters and snipers are lining the 2.6mile route set to be followed by Meghan and Harry and are ready to shoot to kill            A police officer watches on from the rooftops of Windsor during one of Britain\u0027s biggest security operations for years            Soldiers have also been drafted in to secure a ring of steel around Windsor Castle ahead of the biggest UK royal wedding since 2011            Armed officers are on patrol and MailOnline understands there also undercover officers and MI5 ready to act if needed            Superfans camped on the streets overnight to secure their spots to see the procession through the Berkshire town tomorrowArmed police and specially trained sniffer dogs are patrolling the streets of  the royal town, with squadrons of uniformed officers with machine guns toured the town in rotation.Their colleagues are checking drains, bins and any other potential hiding places for bombs as the Berkshire town was turned into a fortress.Thames Valley Police and the Metropolitan Police - who guard the Royals –  used the dress rehearsal yesterday to assess any potential security threats or bottlenecks and crowd surges.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town this weekend - which has a population of 35,000 - to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds.  Wedding planning service Bridebook say it could cost as much as £32million to ensure the event remains safe.The amount is more than double the security needed for the 1981 wedding between Prince Charles and Diana Spencer which was estimated to have cost £4million - which equates to around £12million today.Extra police from around Britain are being called upon to help ensure the event goes off without a hitch, as crowds will fill Windsor to catch a glimpse of the royals.  Since Prince William’s wedding the UK has experienced a surge in terror threats, meaning the cost of Harry’s nuptials outside of the city will be much higher.The couple’s decision to invite more than 2,000 members of the public to attend celebrations at Windsor Castle has also increased security costs. The Queen revealed has said she and the rest of the royal family will pay for the traditional wedding costs like the ceremony, flowers, music and the reception - but security is likely to be paid in full for by the taxpayer.             A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding            Crash barriers are also in place in Windsor to stop a terrorist attacking crowds using a vehicle  \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/23/4C5B4EE100000578-0-image-a-77_1526596043183.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles mother Doria afternoon tea Queen today","story":"Doria (left, leaving her home in LA on Tuesday, is supporting her daughter through the continuing drama over her father Thomas Markle\u0027s involvement in the wedding and has enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 afternoon with Charles and Camilla (right at Kensington Palace yesterday)  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them from Windsor Castle after the rehearsal          The Queen travelled to Windsor from Buckingham Palace to help the couple with their final wedding preparations and wiull meet Doria later today   Doria Ragland, pictured with Meghan, was whisked off to the royal residence after arriving in the UK yesterdayHarry, as is tradition, will say goodbye to wife-to-be and stay elsewhere with his best man, Prince William.The princes have plumped for Coworth Park, a five-star country house a stone’s throw from Windsor and one that has been the venue for many a royal polo match and his first public kiss with Meghan.Doria Ragland has had the royal red carpet rolled out for her ahead of the royal wedding on Saturday.She has been staying at Kensington Palace, has already enjoyed a \u0027very jolly\u0027 afternoon with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.      EXCLUSIVE: Suits star checks out his wedding suit!

Not allowed to get excited\u0027 and his children said he is \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to miss the wedding.Mr Markle said his doctors needed to \u0027go in and clear blockage, repair damage, and put a stent where it is needed\u0027 during the operation.His daughter Samantha, who has a poor relationship with Meghan, claims her father is \u0027upset and alone\u0027 following his surgery.But there is some confusion over his care as sources close to the Markle family said he had already been diagnosed with a heart condition and was due to undergo planned surgery to fit a stent, the same operation Prince Philip underwent in 2011, early next week – on his return from London.Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.   It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.Kensington Palace declined, however, to confirm when Miss Markle had last seen her father or when she planned to see him next. They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles. The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.TMZ yesterday said it had again been in touch with Mr Markle. Journalist Sean Mandell said Miss Markle\u0027s father had told him: \u0027It will take a long time to heal. I\u0027m okay. Staying in the hospital a few more days.

My family were nervous as it was out of their comfort zones but the royals are professional meeters and greeters. \u0027I think my family were in the corner a bit to begin with but the best thing about the royal family is they spot people who are looking nervous and go straight over to them and take that tension out of the room. The royal family welcomed them with open arms.\u0027 Tindall will be attending the wedding tomorrow with his wife but their child will stay home for the reception, he revealed.Regarding the amount of alcohol at the evening party he joked: \u0027I think we\u0027ll lead into it and see where it goes.\u0027Hopefully there will be plenty of it and we\u0027ll just get a feel for the room.

Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.          This picture was taken during the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh showing the couple at Buckingham PalacePrincess Margaret’s wedding dress Princess Margaret, the Countess of Snowdon and The Queen’s sister, was seen in a non-traditional dress made from silk organza in what was dubbed the most glamorous wedding of its time, in 1960.During her first marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Princess wore a modern dress with a skirt comprising of 30 metres of fabric, also designed by Norman Hartnell.Critics claimed it was the simplest wedding gown in history, yet beautiful and sophisticated and can be seen as part of a display at Kensington Palace in London.

The last thing I expected in my life was to be in Buckingham Palace holding a medal called the Companion of Honour. It doesn\u0027t feel like the real world at all.\u0027There\u0027s 65 at any one time yes, you only get in if somebody dies.\u0027He said he did not know who had made space for him to join the elite club, saying it was not something you wanted to discover.Regarding plans for the royal wedding on Saturday, he said: \u0027We haven\u0027t got a street party organised yet - but there\u0027s still time.\u0027           Broadcaster Melvyn Bragg, more formally known as Lord Bragg of Wigton, with Gabriel Clare-HuntHe went on: \u0027The highlight of my career? Getting started. That was the big highlight. When I got a job at the BBC when I was 21 years old I thought \u0027that\u0027s it\u0027.\u0027Retiring. That\u0027s the next big highlight I\u0027m looking forward to in about 10 years\u0027 time! I\u0027ll be doing much of what I\u0027m doing now - writing books.\u0027The former chancellor of Leeds University said he was currently making a programme about the \u0027vital\u0027 teaching of the arts in schools, adding he had a \u0027great concern about the cutting back of arts in universities\u0027.The Labour peer of 20 years and Arsenal fan also touched on the legacy of Arsene Wenger, who managed the club longer than he has sat in the House of Lords.Lord Bragg said: \u0027My son and I went regularly for 20 years and under Wenger\u0027s aegis I saw some of the best club football I\u0027ve seen in my life. So, that\u0027s something to remember.\u0027I\u0027m sad. I think he was very good for Arsenal for maybe 12 to 15 years but he couldn\u0027t bring himself to organise our defence properly. If only he\u0027d organised the defence he\u0027d still be there.\u0027          Actress Julia McKenzie is made a CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by the Prince of Wales during an Investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace Also honoured was Paralympic medalist and long jump champion Stefanie McLeod Reid, whose right foot was amputated after a boating accident as a teenager.The 33-year-old from Loughborough will collect an MBE for services to Paralympic sport.Having won three Paralympic and two world medals over a decade of competition, she took gold with a victorious long jump at the World Para Athletics Championships in London in July 2017. She said she is \u0027overwhelmed\u0027 to receive an MBE. Ms Reid, who grew up in Canada and now lives in Loughborough, said: \u0027It\u0027s surreal. Amazing. I\u0027m more overwhelmed than I expected.\u0027There\u0027s such sincerity in (Prince of Wales\u0027s) eyes, he seems to do everyone with the same amounts of pride. He genuinely wants to make this a good occasion for you.\u0027People are really good. That\u0027s the feeling I\u0027m leaving with.\u0027          Paralympian Stefanie Reid is made an MBE by the Prince of Wales during an Investiture ceremonyMs Reid, who undertook broadcasting work at the Invictus Games in Toronto last year with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in attendance, said: \u0027It was amazing just watching Harry interact and seeing what he\u0027s like behind the scenes.\u0027He loves what he does. It\u0027s not a show, several of the athletes would genuinely count him as a friend.\u0027I wish them all the best. I read they\u0027re most excited about using their lives to make each other better and to challenge each other, and I thought \u0027wow, what a beautiful goal for a marriage\u0027.\u0027Ms Reid said she would be watching the royal wedding after some early-morning training, with her eyes set on securing a place at the Tokyo Paralympics.Dr Peter Florence, who co-founded the Hay literary festival, received a CBE a for services to literature and charity.The festival, held in Hay-on-Wye, Wales, and entering its 31st year next week, was once labelled the \u0027Woodstock of the mind\u0027 by former US president Bill Clinton.Dr Florence said of his honour: \u0027It\u0027s just lovely and this building is so extraordinarily rich and impressive and reminds you of all the incredible work that everybody else who\u0027s being honoured is doing.\u0027An extraordinary range of commitment to the nation.

Actress Julia McKenzie with her CBE presented to her by Prince Charles outside Buckingham Palace\u0027There\u0027s always a sense of holiday and jollity about the big national occasions and given how serious the rest of the world is at the moment this one just seems like a really happy and easy win.\u0027The festival organiser said he never tires of hosting the event and also praised Prince Charles for his support after collecting the CBE from him.He went on: \u0027If the sunshine holds we\u0027ll all be having the most wonderful party.\u0027The great joy is having the Canadian author Margaret Atwood who is arguably the world\u0027s greatest living writer coming to Hay.\u0027It\u0027s a magic thing that for a few days a year that green field in Wales can be a huge focus of attention for people all over the world.\u0027It\u0027s like an infusion of adrenaline of learning, the ideas keep spinning and keep energising you.\u0027Charles has very generously supported the festival. Both he and the Duchess (of Cornwall) have been encouraging for a number of years now.\u0027To channel the weight of heritage with the simple human easiness that he particularly demonstrates is an extraordinary feat and one of the reasons, as heads of state go, we\u0027ve got the best in the business.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C660FE400000578-0-image-m-70_1526652079593.jpg","title":"Archbishop Canterbury praises Meghan Markle officiates wedding","story":"     The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (left) is pictured with American bishop Michael Curry (right) at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor today, ahead of the royal wedding tomorrowAsked about what he thinks of the Prince of Wales being chosen to walk Meghan Markle down the aisle, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said Charles is \u0027someone of great care and affection\u0027.He added: \u0027He\u0027s a very warm person and that he\u0027s doing this is a sign of his love and concern and support.

Shortly afterwards, when asked how he was feeling, he said: \u0027Great, thanks. How are you feeling?\u0027Meghan O\u0027Shea, aged seven, from Holyport in Berkshire, was among those who chatted with Harry.The prince noted the \u0027H\u0027 in the little girl\u0027s name - like his soon-to-be wife Meghan - and she said he remarked: \u0027Is that like the one I\u0027m going to marry?

The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support.

Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/15/4C657D1100000578-5745179-image-a-17_1526653536757.jpg","title":"Frail Yoko Ono visits John Lennons childhood homes Liverpool","story":"Yoko Ono visited Liverpool on Friday in order to open a new exhibition dedicated to her relationship with John Lennon before spending some time at two of his childhood homes, including Mendips (pictured)          Lennon moved to Mendips, at 251 Menlove Avenue, after his parents\u0027 marriage broke down.

You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Doria, now 61, was 23 when she married TV lighting director Tom Markle in Sunset Boulevard\u0027s Self-Realization Fellowship Temple two days before Christmas 1979          Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family financesSo let us go back in time to when Doria Ragland (she now uses her maiden name) was a little girl.Her mother, Jeanette, grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of a bellboy and a lift operator, both of whom worked at the smart, whites-only, five-star St Regis Hotel.Jeanette had been previously married to a professional roller-skater, by whom she had two children — Doria\u0027s half-brother and sister.When he skated out of her life, she was left to bring them up alone. After five years struggling as a single mother, Jeanette fell for snappy-dressing, smooth-talking Alvin Ragland and married again.    Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girlTheir only child, Doria, arrived in 1956 and it was soon after her birth that Alvin uprooted the family and set out to make a new life and better himself across country in California.He had relatives on the West Coast and for a time worked for a real estate business run by his aunt Lillie. Later, by the time Doria was five and he was setting up his modest bric-a-brac and antiques business in central Los Angeles, the marriage was crumbling.At around that time, in Norfolk, England, Diana Spencer was born — not yet Lady Diana, as her father, Viscount (\u0027Johnnie\u0027) Spencer, had not then succeeded to the ancient earldom.Spencer, a former officer in the Royal Scots Greys, had been equerry to both the Queen and her father, George VI, while Diana\u0027s mother, Frances, was the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy.          Meghan Markle and her mother Doria Ragland leave the Windsor Estate after tea with the Queen           Doria Ragland in the Range Rover which took her from tea with the Queen at Windsor to the hotel this evening          Royal fans took pictures of Harry as he greeted crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening They lived on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Park House, a lovely Victorian pile that is now a hotel for the disabled. Park House was, in fact, where Frances was born: her late father was a great friend of the King and her mother a confidante of the Queen, later the Queen Mother.The lives of the Spencer family and the royals were entwined and the children played together.Diana was the Spencers\u0027 third daughter but not, alas, the longed for son who would secure continuance of the title. When baby Charles arrived three years after Diana, it was an occasion for a firework display in celebration. As a result, although her mother always denied she was a \u0027disappointment\u0027, Diana carried doubts throughout her life.No such doubts, though, in Los Angeles for Doria, who got on well with her two older half-siblings, Joseph and Saundra, even though it wasn\u0027t long before her father abandoned the family home.Joseph recalls their mother, Jeanette, having to be \u0027both the mother and father of the family, bent on keeping them fed, clothed and together, and succeeding\u0027.Here was a woman whose determination is seen in the family as having been passed down to her daughter, Doria, as well as her actress granddaughter Meghan.For Diana, growing up meant a series of nannies as, by the time she was five, her mother was no longer at home, having fallen for wallpaper heir Peter Shand Kydd.Contrary to popular gossip, her mother wasn\u0027t a so-called \u0027bolter\u0027 but fought in court for custody of her children — only to lose, largely because of the infamous intervention of her own mother Ruth, who sided with her son-in-law.In Los Angeles, Doria\u0027s mother struggled on as a single parent, yet family life in her household was warm and stable.Doria was turning into a bright child who got a prized place at the formerly all-white Fairfax High School in West Hollywood. But in 1971, when she was 15, her education was disrupted by the San Fernando earthquake.The quake destroyed nearby Los Angeles High School, so the two schools had to merge. Doria\u0027s school day was rescheduled to begin at 7am and end at noon.Despite the disruption, she remained one of its brighter pupils, a member of the school\u0027s Apex Club for high achievers.No such academic high-flying for Diana. She was privately educated at boarding schools in Norfolk — and later in Kent — at a time when, even though the Queen Charlotte\u0027s Ball era of debutantes was over, little more was expected of girls from aristocratic families than to find a suitable husband.  Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single manDiana was not academically strong and left school with no O-levels. But she was far from being \u0027thick as two planks\u0027, as she later self-deprecatingly (and foolishly) described herself.The phrase stuck and was used to denigrate her later during the \u0027War of the Waleses\u0027.Doria, meanwhile, despite her early promise, did not go to university but started work selling jewellery, almost certainly to help the family finances.She also assisted in her father\u0027s store, called \u0027Twas New, and ran a bric-a-brac stall in a Sunday flea market. She even managed to work part-time in a travel agency.At this time, Diana was still at West Heath girls\u0027 school in Kent, excelling at swimming, ballet, tap-dancing and piano. For her, there was no question of having to start work when she left West Heath. Instead, it was finishing school in Rougemont, Switzerland, followed by a cordon bleu cookery course in London.In Los Angeles, Doria was deciding to become a showbusiness make-up artist.As with everything she put her hand to, she did well and found herself training on the set of ABC\u0027s TV drama General Hospital.Also there was the large, cheery figure of Tom Markle, the show\u0027s established lighting director, who was orced with two children.Before long she had moved in with him. But it wasn\u0027t all plain sailing, as his daughter Samantha was far from welcoming. To friends, she cruelly took great pleasure in referring to Doria as \u0027the maid\u0027 on account of her being black.Even in 1979, mixed marriages were not common in the U.S. But despite family uncertainty, Tom and Doria were married. The venue, the Self-Realization temple, was Doria\u0027s choice because she had started to follow the teachings of Yogananda, a Hindu yoga guru.          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodWithin 11 months, Doria was pregnant with Meghan. It was November 1980.Meanwhile, Diana was living in a flat in Earl\u0027s Court, West London, bought for her by her mother as an 18th birthday present, and sharing it with three other girls. She worked as a nanny and part-time nursery school assistant.In July 1980 she and Prince Charles spent a fateful afternoon together at a barbecue in Petworth, West Sussex. He was the most eligible bachelor on the planet, and within weeks he made it known to friends that he had found the woman he wanted to marry.Exactly a year later, theirs was a typically sumptuous royal wedding, with one sad similarity to today\u0027s event — the frailty of the father of the bride.Earl Spencer had suffered a stroke and almost died. But he was at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral to give his daughter away, though everyone knew she was largely supporting him on their walk up the aisle.And so the parallel lives of Diana and Doria continued.Barely had Charles and Diana returned from their honeymoon when, in Los Angeles, Doria was giving birth at West Park hospital in Canoga Park to a baby girl, whom the happy parents called Rachel Meghan. She was their only child. The date of her birth — August 4, 1981 — was a day the British royals were also celebrating: it was the Queen Mother\u0027s 81st birthday.Tom Markle had decorated baby Meghan\u0027s room with Disney characters and few would have thought then that the marriage would not last. He and Doria seemed happy. But Tom spent a long time at work, sometimes 90 hours a week, and eventually the strain began to tell.Meghan had just had her second birthday in 1983 when her parents split up, although they didn\u0027t orce for another five years.As for Charles and Diana, William had been born in June 1982 and Harry followed in September 1984. But already there were tensions in this royal marriage.Doria and Tom agreed to share custody of Meghan, still spent time with each other and even holidayed together.When Tom worked on a television programme, Doria let Meghan watch it with her, and loved it when their daughter rushed to kiss the screen as her father\u0027s name rolled by on the credits.Work would have been a big problem for Doria but for the help of her mother Jeanette, who stepped in to look after Meghan.As her older step-brother Joseph recalls: \u0027My mother babysat and when Doria finished work, she\u0027d go over to my mother\u0027s house to pick her up.\u0027Small wonder that in later years, after Jeanette suffered a stroke, Meghan would sit with her, talking to her granny, holding her hand and cooking for her. Jeanette died in 2000, aged 71.No such harmony at Kensington Palace. At around the time young Meghan was kissing the TV screen, Diana and Harry were watching a TV programme about Prince Charles which focused on Harry\u0027s father\u0027s affair with Camilla Parker Bowles. When her name was mentioned, Harry asked his mother: \u0027Who\u0027s Camilla?\u0027The split between Harry\u0027s parents when he was eight was the prelude to years of acrimony. When, finally, they were orced in 1996, Diana and Charles also shared custody of their two sons.Harry has subsequently said he doesn\u0027t remember much about it, but friends believe the pain of that time was eclipsed by the death of his mother the following year.In the last months of her life, Diana\u0027s relationship with her own mother also suffered. They were no longer speaking at the time of the Princess\u0027s death.For Diana, the unhappiness in her marriage pulled her towards finding consolation in helping others, from Aids and leprosy victims to those maimed by landmines. She was concerned for people at the margins of society.And in LA, Doria was moving in a similar direction — but hers was a switch in career, from make-up to training as a social worker.These days, she concentrates on the geriatric community, working for Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in West Los Angeles.Such caring values also dictated Meghan\u0027s upbringing. As a child, Doria wanted to show her there was more to the world than the affluent neighbourhood of Woodland Hills, where they lived. So she took her daughter to see life in the slums of Jamaica and the backstreets of the Mexican city of Oaxaca, where Meghan recalls seeing children playing in dirt roads and hawking chewing gum.Diana took the same approach. As boys, William and Harry accompanied their mother to meet rough-sleepers on the streets of London and the charity staff helping them to survive.As Harry and Meghan say their vows today, who could deny that the linking of this couple from two very different worlds would not be quite so smooth were it not for their mothers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/22/4C688EEE00000578-5746491-image-a-5_1526677266827.jpg","title":"DOMINIC SANDBROOK 20 years ago wedding inconceivable","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen leaving Kensington Palace the day before their weddingAnd after all the red-top tabloid headlines, all the traumas of his early life, all the girlfriends, the parties and the scandals, Prince Harry — seasoned in service to his country — has found happiness at last.Good for him. He deserves it.This being the Royal Family, of course, things are never straightforward. To Buckingham Palace, the events of the last week must have felt like an unfolding nightmare.Even by the soap opera standards to which the House of Windsor often descends, the chaotic shambles of Meghan’s semi-estranged father Thomas — who planned to walk her down the aisle, apparently staged pictures for a paparazzo, seemingly suffered a heart attack, decided to cry off, changed his mind and then cried off again so Prince Charles is now doing the honours — marks a tragi-comic low point.Still, even the smoothest wedding build-up is rarely free from moments of panic, and there can be few married couples in Britain unfamiliar with the phenomenon of embarrassing in-laws.In any case, the monarchy has long had a melodramatic dimension, in which calamitous weddings have played a particularly eye-catching part. And when compared with past royal nuptials, the excesses of the House of Markle look almost mundane. Although we typically like to think of royal weddings as fairytale occasions, the truth is that many were like something from an unusually horrific nightmare.No pampered public schoolboys or Corbyn crazed snowflakes: The Open University MUST be saved, says DOMINIC SANDBROOK DOMINIC SANDBROOK: We are one of the most prosperous, stable, literate, sophisticated and safest countries on Earth.

Historian DOMINIC SANDBROOK says Britain has become a nation of overgrown toddlers with a bigoted mob mentality, intolerance and a raging sense of grievance at every slight As two films are released about the man who united our nation, where is a Winston Churchill when we need one?Think, for example, of the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne of Cleves in 1540: the king an obese monstrosity with a stinking ulcer on his leg, his German bride a ‘Flanders mare’ who seemed completely out of her depth.Not surprisingly, it was never consummated: rather ungallantly, Henry claimed he had been put off by the ‘hanging of her breasts and looseness of her flesh’.The real soap opera stars, though, were the Hanoverians, who specialised in laughably catastrophic weddings. The marriage of Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1736 is a case in point. Once again the bride was German. At just 16, Augusta of Saxe-Gotha did not speak a word of English and was patently terrified.As she shuffled down the aisle at St James’s Palace she was violently sick, not merely over her own dress, but over her new mother-in-law, Queen Caroline.The most spectacularly disastrous royal wedding of all, though, was that of the future George IV to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795.They first met only three days before the wedding, when George was so disgusted with his bride’s appearance that he immediately called for brandy.At the wedding itself, again at St James’s Palace, George arrived drunk, fell over on the steps of the altar and refused to recite his vows until his father, George III, ordered him to comply.          Meghan Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, arriving at Cliveden House Hotel on the National Trust\u0027s Cliveden Estate to spend the night before her wedding to Prince Harry    A fan of the Royal Family poses in a Union Jack outfit in Windsor ahead of the wedding Although we live in an age of risible hysteria about race and ‘ersity’, especially in the upper echelons of the BBC and in our major universities, most normal people see nothing sensational in the thought of the Queen’s grandson marrying a brown-skinned American. Most of us prefer to judge Ms Markle by her personality, not by her skin pigmentation.Ironically, the monarchy is much more in tune with the instincts of the nation than its chattering-class critics. After all, one in ten British couples now involve people with different ethnicities, while an estimated 833,000 British children are currently being raised by mixed-race couples.In this respect, one family — the Windsors — is the symbol of a bigger story. And that is precisely as it should be.The nation itself, after all, is nothing if it is not an extended family. And the appeal of the Royal Family, when you forget the palaces and pageantry, derives partly from the fact that when we look at them, we see ourselves.Few people embody that more than Harry himself. There cannot be many families who are unfamiliar with the younger son who struggled to find his niche, the party animal who found a serious side or the playboy who grew up.Indeed, one reason that Harry has such wide public appeal is that he is an immediately recognisable figure. Like a modern version of Shakespeare’s Prince Hal — the wayward prince who grew in stature to become Henry V, victor of Agincourt — he has evolved from the days of Nazi fancy-dress party costumes and Las Vegas stripping sessions to serving in Afghanistan and promoting the Invictus Games for injured military veterans.Harry’s is an impressive and inspirational story, not least since he lost his mother in such traumatic circumstances and had to grow up in the glare of the international spotlight.Indeed, I suspect that Harry’s spectacular public approval ratings — one poll recently found that 81 per cent of us have a positive view of him and only 11 per cent have a negative view — reflect the fact that many people still see him as the shell-shocked little boy walking behind his mother’s coffin.No politician could dream of matching such figures. And that, of course, points to another story. In an era when so many other great institutions, from Parliament to the BBC, seem tarnished and beleaguered, the Firm’s sheer resilience, its tenacious grip on our national imagination, remains enormously impressive.Twenty years ago, after the death of Diana, there was a brief burst of apocalyptic talk about the end of the monarchy. But no one is talking about that now. Indeed, when our national destiny seems so uncertain and our public figures inspire such little enthusiasm, the monarchy stands out as the one unchanging fixture, a bulwark of tradition, a beacon of stability in an age of dizzying change.At a time when the world’s most famous republican office is occupied by Donald Trump, the hereditary principle of monarchy looks in pretty robust health to me. After all, the Swedes, the Danes, the Norwegians, the Dutch and the Belgians all have monarchies, and they rank among the safest, richest, most developed and contented societies on earth. Even France’s President Emmanuel Macron — a would-be Napoleon if ever there was one — once remarked that his countrymen are ‘eternally nostalgic’ for their lost kings. ‘The French elect their president to be a monarch,’ he said. ‘Then they want to cut his head off.’In Britain, thankfully, we gave up beheading our kings in 1649. And although other monarchies, from Germany to Russia, have fallen by the wayside, ours remains the supreme symbol of Britishness both at home and abroad.Cynics sometimes like to present us as forelock-tugging lackeys, brainwashed into subservience.But this is nonsense. We know perfectly well that the Royal Family are all too human, with faults and foibles we can all immediately recognise.But the monarchy is the symbol of something bigger, the nation itself — which is why so many metropolitan liberals, the self-styled ‘citizens of nowhere’ who think themselves above the time-honoured loyalties of place and nation, are intellectually incapable of understanding its appeal.Its magic does not lie in the flags and carriages, although they are part of it.The real magic lies in the blend of the national and the inidual, the patriotic and the personal, the past and the present.Of course, the hard-Left can never understand this.Their minds twisted by extremism, their hearts coarsened by envy, they see only privilege where the rest of us see patriotism.Well, let the naysayers stew in their joyless misery. The rest of us, in our tens of millions, would raise a glass to an institution that has served Britain splendidly for centuries, and to two people who deserve a happy future together.For although this is a great national occasion, we should not forget that at its heart are two young people who are not so different, deep down, from thousands of others getting married this summer.So let’s hope today’s happy scenes banish the memories of the last week.And, if you’ll forgive the lèse-majesté, let’s hope the wedding night goes better than it did for Henry VIII. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/12/14/4C224B3700000578-0-image-m-29_1526132426322.jpg","title":"Marks Spencer plot home delivery service bring food drink door hour","story":"    Marks \u0026amp Spencer is rumoured to be looking at launching a home delivery service for food in response to a surge in online grocery shoppingTo date, M\u0026ampS has shied away from going ahead because the service is massively expensive to run and will seriously erode profit margins, despite the income from delivery charges.One problem that M\u0026ampS has is that people typically shop for a small basket of premium items, rather than doing a full weekly shop. This cuts the value of a typical order and means it is less financially viable.Such is the shift to online shopping, coupled with the threat posed by Amazon, which is now delivering fresh food, that M\u0026ampS bosses appear to feel they must offer a service.Pull the udder one!

Things get done out of frustration then you look back and you know you\u0027ve made a mistake,\u0027 he said. He went on to share his \u0027fondest\u0027 memory of hs estranged half-sibling. \u0027My favourite and fondest memory of Meghan is - well, it was an unfortunate time with my grandmother passing - but in the two years prior to that we would spend every other weekend together, with my grandmother, and it was a very personal time. \u0027She gave selfless attention and cared for my grandmother. It was incredible. Meghan would come into the room and she would light up like a Christmas tree.          Meghan Markle married Prince Harry in an extraordinary ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on Saturday. Thomas Markle Jr. was not invited \u0027It was a great time because that was the real Meghan. It is the real Meghan. I will never forget it and my father will never forget it. It\u0027s very special,\u0027 he said. He said it was \u0027understandable\u0027 that she threw herself into the role of a lifetime on Suits and, despite previous comments, now doesn\u0027t blame her for it.                              \u0027It\u0027s hard on everybody.

When you jump into Hollywood like that it demands so much of you it pulls you in every different direction, away from your family and away from contact.\u0027And that\u0027s completely understandable - that\u0027s Hollywood. If you ask any actress or actor they\u0027ll do that first before anything. We still remain close at heart.\u0027If I was in Meghan\u0027s shoes I would get caught up and forget to make that phone call.\u0027We didn\u0027t have a falling out, we always had a great relationship and I\u0027m very proud of her. I was busy in my life too and I\u0027d relocated from LA.\u0027Everyone gets busy. It\u0027s normal in our family,\u0027 he said. Considering himself an expert on the occasion, he predicted that the bride\u0027s dress would be \u0027the nicest dress anyone has ever seen\u0027.   Thomas\u0027s sister Samantha has also launched astonishing attacks on Meghan (seen together right in 2008)          On Saturday, Samantha continued her cashing-in crusade by inviting a TV crew round to her Ocala, Florida, home to watch the wedding \u0027The dress is probably going to be the most stand out, one of a kind wedding dress ever made and she wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. \u0027It\u0027s going to be the nicest dress anyone has ever seen - a proper princess. I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it.\u0027I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters,\u0027 he said.  He added that their father, who has had his own share of embarrassment this week after it was revealed he had staged paparazzi photographs and taken money for it, backed out of the wedding at the last minute.           Also not there was the bride\u0027s father Thomas Markle Sr. who embarrassed himself this week by staging paparazzi photographs and taking a sum for it. He suffered a heart attack and said that was the reason he would not attend           Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s mother, was the only member of her family who was seen. She beamed with pride throughout her drive to the chapel with her daughter and during the emotional ceremony Thomas Markle Sr. said a recent heart attack, which he suffered days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, kept him from the event.Markle Sr. said his father was happy Prince Charles stood in to accompany Meghan for some of her long walk down St. George\u0027s Chapel. \u0027I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there,\u0027 he said. Markle Jr. added that he was sure Meghan and Harry would be eager to start their own family soon and painted her as a maternal figure who had long doted on his children.           Meghan, 36, is pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday during her wedding to Prince Harry. Her half-brother said on Friday that she is \u0027incredible\u0027 \u0027When she was young, dealing with my kids and the way she interacted with them and loved them unconditionally and played with them, it was very obvious she loves children.\u0027She\u0027ll be looking forward to starting her family and that\u0027s a good thing. She\u0027s going to have a great time. \u0027I wish them all the happiness in the world,\u0027 he said.The only member of Meghan\u0027s family who was visibly present at the wedding was her mother, Doria Ragland. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/15/4C6E82FA00000578-5747793-image-m-61_1526738688843.jpg","title":"Kate arrives hand hand Meghans adorable flower girls page boys","story":"Dress your little princess in white like Charlotte in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy couture bridesmaid dressUnavailable to buy - click to browse the current collection by the deisgnerPrincess Charlotte always looks adorable, and her cuteness reached a whole new level in this gorgeous little flower girl dress.

She and six other activists have been arrestedThe activists had persistently called for the right for women to drive, with the ban to be lifted in just six weeks.However, they stressed that this was only the first step toward full rights and for year also called for an end to less visible forms of discrimination.They campaigned for lifting guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry.Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal.All major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some state-linked media outlets published the names of those detained, which include Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Najfan.          Pro-government media outlets splashed their photos online and in newspapers, accusing them of betrayal for their supposed crimesRights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights. Several of the women were professors at state-run universities and are mothers or grandmothers.The Interior Ministry on Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with \u0027foreign entities\u0027. It said they were working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and giving money to foreign circles aiming to destabilise and harm the kingdom.The stunning arrests come just six weeks before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world\u0027s only ban on women driving next month.Saudi police save three women from rapists - then arrest...Millions of Muslims around the world prepare for...Share this articleWhen the kingdom issued its royal decree last year announcing that women would be allowed to drive in 2018, women\u0027s rights activists were contacted by the royal court and warned against giving interviews to the media or speaking out on social media.Following the warnings, some women left the country for a period of time and others stopped voicing their opinions on Twitter.As activists were pressured into silence, Saudi Arabia\u0027s 32-year-old heir to the throne stepped forth, positioning himself as the force behind the kingdom\u0027s reforms.However, Human Rights Watch said the crown prince\u0027s so-called reform campaign \u0027has been a frenzy of fear for genuine Saudi reformers who dare to advocate publicly for human rights or women\u0027s empowerment\u0027.\u0027The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince\u0027s rights agenda faces time in jail,\u0027 Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said  Loujain al-Hathloul was another of the seven activists branded \u0027traitors\u0027 who were working for \u0027foreign entities\u0027Last year, Prince Mohammed oversaw the arrests of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were perceived as critics of his foreign policies. He also led an unprecedented shakedown of top princes and businessmen, forcing them to hand over significant portions of their wealth in exchange for their freedom as part of a purported anti-corruption campaign.In an interview with CBS in March, he said that he was \u0027absolutely\u0027 sending a message through these arrests that there was a new sheriff in town.Activists said writer Mohammed al-Rabea and lawyer Ibrahim al-Mudaimigh, two men who worked to support women\u0027s rights campaigners, are also among the seven detained. Al-Mudaimigh defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in late 2014 for more than 70 days for her online criticism of the government and for attempting to bring attention to the driving ban by driving from neighboring United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.Those familiar with the arrests said al-Hathloul was forcibly taken by security forces earlier this year from the UAE, where she was residing, and forced back to the kingdom.In recent weeks, activists said several women\u0027s rights campaigners were also banned from traveling abroad.  Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal and major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured)Immediately after news of the arrests broke, pro-government Twitter accounts were branding the group as treasonous under an Arabic hashtag describing them as traitors for foreign embassies.The pro-government SaudiNews50 Twitter account, with its 11.5 million followers, splashed images of those arrested with red stamps over their face that read \u0027traitor\u0027 and saying that \u0027history spits in the face of the country\u0027s traitors.\u0027The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front-page a photo of al-Hathloul and al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.Activists said some in the group were arrested on Tuesday and at least one person was arrested Thursday.They said the detainees were transferred from the capital, Riyadh, to the city of Jiddah for interrogations where the royal court has relocated for the month of Ramadan.Activists said it wasn\u0027t not clear why the seven were arrested now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/15/4C6E860300000578-5747477-image-a-51_1526739024569.jpg","title":"En route Prince Harry leaves Coworth Park hotel royal Wedding","story":"Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

Thursday was an official military rehearsal day, and the town was packed with people joining in with the royal event.About 5,000 media representatives have been accredited, from organisations including 79 international networks and 46 US affiliates. The US is especially excited to have its very own British princess.On the Long Walk, journalists will be offered an unimpeded view of the carriage on its way to the castle.

One young boy can barely see out of his police helmet, and walks into a lamppost shortly after being photographed.Railings along the route are lined with people who take merriment seriously. One lady has travelled from Australia and is attending her eighth royal wedding.Local businesses are used to royal ceremony and souvenirs are available at every turn. Scarves and flags are the stock and trade but there are quirkier offerings too.Flags, flags ... and bagsPhones are held aloft at the entrance to castle waiting for the military parade to start.

British people don’t need too much encouragement to get silly outside the pub.Built in 1518, and a public house since 1689, this pub has been renamed The Prince Harry, with a new sign, a portrait of the prince and plenty of balloons and flag decorations, and is even serving a royal wedding pale ale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec605e344bb52dca8cde2f98c23882645a7b0c31/0_9_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31f8c2080c26355e4e295dee0e2bc0eb","title":"art market rising prices modigliani hockney","story":"When even the experts are warning that prices for works of art have become obscene, it is probably time to run a dispassionate eye over the multimillion-dollar frenzy for certain works.Last week, Nu couché (sur le côté gauche) by Amedeo Modigliani sold to an unnamed buyer for $157m, and a new record was set for a David Hockney painting when Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica was bought for $28.5m.Clare McAndrew of consultancy Art Economics says: “It’s slightly obscene, isn’t it? When you think of the other artists who could be supported by that money.” She adds that the Modigliani transaction is an illustration of the wealthy elite’s predilection for untamed spending: “To spend money on one thing like that shows ultra wealth gone wild.”The price reached at the Modigliani auction reflects the state of the world economy, says McAndrew, who also compiles an annual study of the global art market with Swiss bank UBS. Stronger growth is fuelling the market, spiralling prices reflect rising rampant and rising inequality across advanced economies.The art market broadly matched the growth rate of the global economy between 2000 and 2017, according to the latest UBS report, with world GDP and wealth both rising last year. Even so, some paintings are so famous they can fetch dizzyingly high prices when the economy is in a downturn.Simple economics suggest the price of an artwork is determined by how much a buyer is prepared to spend and what a seller would accept. The cold equation of supply and demand also means the death of an artist – immediately limiting their output – raises the value of their work.But unlike widgets, whose value can be calculated by looking at rates of production and demand from consumers, there are myriad intangibles in the world of art. Any price tag at all can seem jarring for a creative medium where consumption is an issue of taste, not necessity, and the motive for the work is, ideally, creative expression, not financial gain.Obviously some artists play the market. Purists have objected to Damien Hirst’s production-line techniques, and Andy Warhol turned the idea of authenticity upside down with his screen prints. Yet works by both artists have retained their value. Gustav Metzger, who died aged 90 last year, was revered for his auto-destructive art: he sprayed acid on canvas to cause damage over time, defying the notion of long-term commercial value.Experts say the finest works rarely come up for sale, yet demand is increasing as newly wealthy Chinese buyers compete with financiers and Saudi sheikhs.“Scarcity rules,” says Andrew Renton, professor of curating at Goldsmiths University. “People are always waiting in the wings. It can be 30 years before a painting comes upand some never turn around in people’s lifetimes.”Nu couché (sur le côté gauche), painted in 1917, three years before Modigliani’s death at 35, is one of the Italian painter’s largest works, and one of only five of his nudes ever to come up for auction. It was last sold in 2003, for $26.9m – reportedly to the Irish horse breeder John Magnier at Christie’s.This would appear to make fine art a surefire winner for wealthy investors. But the market has crashed before, most spectacularly after Japanese buyers acquired half of all the impressionist art put on the market in 1990. The bubble burst a year later when Japan’s economy crashed after an unsustainable property boom.Today, hedge fund billionaires and wealthy Asian investors trade canvases like stocks, bonds or commodities – mirroring a trend for the hoarding of fine wines, where crates of vintage red can be left unopened for decades, then sold at higher prices.Mega sales may boost egos in the City but the Modigliani sale alone could put at least 10,000 students through a year of art school in the UK.Renton agrees that the money could be put to better use elsewhere. “There are impossible amounts of money to be made in the world today. It can be used for good, or in a lot of very interesting ways. Culture is a good use, but I also think putting £1bn into curing cancer is also good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4beb4a3b74d5e724425d36a117bef2d396a3bb66/0_786_964_578/master/964.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7202cd1b563ef2c0958e238d61aa2bb3","title":"frank bird masters the early modernist photographer in pictures","story":"A collection of rare early modernist photographs taken in the 20s and 30s is to be exhibited at The London Photograph Fair this weekend"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c13cd561c5c812358189aca02892fc171b0ddc9/0_0_5918_7890/master/5918.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=35d9673a36bb2ccebed7b1688338aa2c 1760w","title":"lady in blue the nudes of lisa brice in pictures","story":"South Africa-born artist Lisa Brice first began working on her series of blue female nudes in 2014. “The situations are imagined,” she says, “but based on real experience.” They’ve been all-consuming at times: “I painted a group of 60 continuously day and night for a month,” she says. “Eventually they grew into a small army of feminine figures.”Brice, who now lives in London after spells in Trinidad, partly chose the colour because of its associations, “from the glow of blue neon signs to the fleeting colour of twilight, to the Trinidadian ‘blue devil’ carnival character”. The paintings are now on display at Tate Britain. Nudes have long been painted by and for men, and Brice sees hers as an important reclamation of the female body. “Whether her figures are undressing or enjoying a cigarette, “they are not presenting themselves for the pleasure of the viewer – their own pleasure is paramount”.

Last month, he was awarded the Pulitzer prize for fiction for his most recent novel, Less, a tragicomic story about the life, loves and disappointments of a 49-year-old writer. Greer ides his time between San Francisco and Tuscany, where he is executive director of the Santa Maddalena Foundation, a writers’ retreat.How have the first few weeks been as a Pulitzer prize-winning author?I’ve been very touched. I had seven Pulitzer winners contact me within 24 hours: Donna Tartt reached out to say congratulations and enjoy yourself. I have to watch out that I don’t get arrogant! I tipped into that last week and somebody called me out on it. I still have to do the grocery shopping and feed the dogs and I can’t somehow decide that because I have a Pulitzer the dogs don’t need to eat any more. So the dogs are not impressed with me.Less is the first comic novel to win the Pulitzer in years. Have comic novels become unfashionable?I was reading an article in the New York Times about how fashion needs to be more full of joy. That’s exactly what I was feeling when I wrote Less. It’s not that I’m not aware of the horrible way the world is. It’s that I can’t bear it. So I wrote a book that tackles that, but is about joy.Why, in the literary world, are comic novels are often deemed less important than serious ones?In America, our idea of the great American novel is deeply serious: 800 pages, by a straight white man. People assume that comedy is avoiding the subject, but when it’s good it looks directly at it. And you can tell when you’re with honest comic material because you feel uncomfortable, then you’re released through feeling that\u0026nbspdiscomfort.Will winning a big prize change your relationship to your\u0026nbspwriting?That was keeping me awake at 3am, so I’m glad you asked! Not if I take a Xanax, like I did at 3.30. I assume it’ll give me confidence to go on with my next project without worrying, but I don’t write well when I’m really confident. I write best when I’m worried. Luckily, I have a reserve of doubt I can pull from.Your protagonist, Arthur Less, is gay, but is accused in the novel of being “a bad gay” because he makes his characters “suffer without reward”. Is there pressure on gay writers to present positive, uplifting portrayals of gay characters?I tell my students they are going to struggle with telling a story from their community, and letting that community down, because they won’t tell the myth the community wants. They’re going to tell the truth and that’s going to disappoint whatever community it\u0026nbspis.The novel has an unashamedly romantic, happy ending, which isn’t often found in literary novels. Did you always intend that?I never had a doubt. There’s a gap on my bookshelf for a story about two men in love that isn’t about trauma and despair and I wanted to write that book. You know, Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful story, but it is not the story of most people I know. It’s not a story that gets you excited about your possible romantic future. I wanted to have a book that acknowledged the difficulty of being gay in the world, but also the possibility of joy.You’re an identical twin. How has that shaped your perception of\u0026nbspidentity?I am used to being with another person in the world, so it makes it lonelier when I’m not with him. It’s strange because we’re very similar people, so to see someone who I think of as being a kind of copy of me lead a different life and make different choices is remarkable because it makes you think we really do choose our destinies. And that’s a little scary to realise.What were your favourite books as a\u0026nbspchild?Any book with a map at the beginning: you realise there’s a whole world in this book, and you’re going to all those places. That’s a thrilling feeling. I still like a map in a book.Was it a bookish household?Very. My parents grew up in poor families in the rural south and books were their escape. They both became scientists – which was an unlikely thing to become – and so books were always treasured in our home.Are there any genres you avoid in your own reading?Like most writers, I read to help my own writing. And that means there’s a lot of things that I love but don’t help. Graphic novels are fantastic but they’re not helping me write so I put them\u0026nbspaside.So are there writers you do read when you’re seeking inspiration?It’s going to sound so pretentious for a book like mine, but it’s always Proust. Also Nabokov and WG\u0026nbspSebald. And for Less, I read Philip Roth often – I can’t read more than one because I get too irritated at the misogyny, but the writing is fantastic. I hope by osmosis I’m picking up some of their language or sensibility or, hopefully, even stealing outright from them.Is there a very famous book – contemporary or classic – that you’ve just never got around to reading?Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. If you’re an American male you’re supposed to read it, but maybe that’s why I stayed away from it.What’s the best book you’ve ever been given as a present?My best friend Daniel gives me books constantly, and there’s one that’s out of print by the American playwright Lillian Hellman – she wrote a crazy book called Maybe that just enthralled me for years because it’s so nuts.What book do you like giving to other people?I give Raymond Chandler – The Big Sleep or The Long Goodbye. You know how people want to be a reader but they aren’t reading? If I give them Raymond Chandler, they fall back into being a reader again because it’s so fantastic and highly literary.What books are on your bedside table right now?Don Quixote, which is enough book for now. Actually, it goes fast, it’s so fun. I’m reading a modern English translation, which makes it zippier than the antique Spanish.What’s next after Don Quixote?Probably Barry Gifford – The Stars Above Veracruz. You probably don’t know him except as the writer of Wild at Heart. He’s in that Raymond Chandler mode of crime and guns and people smoking and whisky but it’s highly literary. And you wouldn’t think I’d like that kind of book, but I really do. Genre fiction writers are so good at things literary writers aren’t good at – you can learn a lot from them.• Less by Andrew Sean Greer is published by Little, Brown (£8.99).

Africa is seen as particularly vulnerable after decades of underinvestment that has left many countries with seemingly little option but to accept the terms laid down by the tech giants.“Tech companies like to project a modern, progressive image to the world. But under the surface, companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and Uber are pursuing an agenda that could hand them dangerous levels of control over our lives and profoundly harm economic development in the global south,” the report says.Industry bodies deny that there are moves to establish global rules that would force-feed western technology to developing-world countries. They say that e-commerce liberates small and medium-sized businesses to export goods they could never previously afford to sell. They also say that states’ attempts to keep data in local servers prevents tech firms benefiting from economies of scale by housing data in vast hubs across the globe.Christian Borggreen, a researcher at the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA), the Geneva-based lobby group for Facebook, Netflix, BT, Amazon, eBay and others, says: “Forced data localisation is on the rise globally. Since the year 2000 the number of national requirements grew from 15 to 84.”That is significant, he says, because there is a risk that countries that demand data localisation “do this for protectionist or censorship reasons”. He is thinking of Russia and China.There is also a potential risk of damage to productivity from throwing sand in the wheels of global tech. The International Monetary Fund said last month that half of the productivity gains in the developing world came from globalisation, and much of that comes from the adoption of western technology.However, Nick Dearden, head of Global Justice Now, says it is essential that developing countries retain their citizens’ data within their borders to avoid the core of their economies being directed from abroad.The idea that they should be passive receivers of western technology, and borrow heavily on international financial markets to pay for it, means they become prey to the whims of foreign businesses, he says.Susan Aaronson, a digital trade expert at George Washington University in Washington DC, says fighting the adoption of international rules to protect local data privacy is the wrong approach. She argues that developing world countries “could say to tech firms ‘you need to pay for our data and you need to be transparent about how you use it’. They haven’t so far. They’ve accepted the Facebook model.” Separately, they could negotiate common rules for e-commerce.Nick Ashton-Hart, a trade expert who used to work at the CCIA, says the report should consider the issue of data separately from e-commerce. Whereas Dearden considers Amazon, eBay, Alibaba and other trading platforms as rent-seeking operators that suck money out of the economy, Ashton-Hart says they should be seen as giving small businesses in developing-world countries access to global markets. Allowing them, along with Facebook, Google and other global operators, to store data where they want to would create huge efficiency savings that could be passed on to local businesses and consumers.If there is a problem taxing or regulating technology transfers, intellectual property or the sale of goods and services across borders, that is an issue of local governance, says Ashton-Hart, who now works for the International Chamber of Commerce, a group that promotes UK exports.Likewise, governments can set the rules for their citizens’ online privacy and do not need to do it by demanding that global firms maintain relatively small local databases. “The bigger issue is that more than 100 countries have no privacy laws at all, according to Unctad, but this isn’t addressed at all,” says Ashton-Hart. “If developing countries want to protect their nationals, that’s where to start, and NGOs should be calling them out for not doing it.”The issue has come into sharp focus with the EU’s plan to impose new data protection rules in Europe that force companies to win the consent of users before storing personal data online, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).It becomes law at the end of this week, and is causing huge anxiety in the tech sector and a backlash from small business that rely on customer databases to generate new business.Dearden says the issue has become pressing since e-commerce leapt to the top of the World Trade Organisation’s agenda last year in Argentina. African countries were particularly alarmed at proposals to establish a level playing field that would force them to allow trade with major foreign businesses.In a statement following the meeting, African countries signed up to a declaration by the Rwandan delegation, which said the planned rules meant small businesses would be “least likely to be able to effectively compete with multinational corporations, who have become global digital leaders, and have decimated smaller\u0026nbspcompanies”.It said these multinationals had “benefited from digital industrial policies such as subsidies, R\u0026ampD subsidies, development of, and access to, and ownership of technologies, economies of scale, government-sponsored infrastructure, tax benefits, etc”.Dearden admits developing countries are split, with some wanting to take whatever the tech firms have to offer to spur growth.“Some on the pro side have been talked to by the developed countries. Others think it sounds nice but don’t know all the implications. But WTO was a major victory for us in that formal movement on this wasn’t agreed – and that’s because some developing countries, especially in Africa, fought it tooth and nail.”Some of the most advanced African countries are the most serious about protecting their domestic industries from foreign competition. Only last week, Kenya pulled out of a free trade pact with China after it decided the deal was too one-sided.Technology is seen as solving huge problems for developing countries, from corruption to poor standards of education and healthcare, but the issue of democratic control is unlikely to go away – and is likely to prevent international agreement being reached any time soon.The tech industry’s appetite for markets to conquer is insatiable and healthcare is a priority. Last year Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, revealed that his near-trillion-dollar company was putting healthcare at the centre of all its phone developments.Apple wanted to save lives, he said. A smartphone can be your personal doctor, monitoring your health minute by minute, accessing test results and providing medical information.But this could become a serious issue if the big tech companies don’t just provide the phone, but also hold the health information gathered by it – information that is in high demand from, for instance, financial services companies looking to sell products to the country’s healthiest people – or to cancer patients.In the UK, consultants working at the Royal Free Hospital trust in London were told last year that it had been illegal for them to approach DeepMind, an artificial intelligence firm owned by Google’s parent, about developing software based on patient data from the trust.DeepMind walked away. But it has stressed to its investors that structured health data and artificial intelligence are the next phase in the company’s business plan. It wants to move into disease detection, constructing a new data infrastructure around health data, and potentially sell insurance off the back of this information. The main target is the $3tn (£2.2tn) US market, but the big populations of the developing world will be in its sights.Apple is in the process of setting up a network of medical clinics in the US through a subsidiary, AC Wellness. Some believe it could be a blueprint for countries unable to invest in anything more than rudimentary health systems. Nick Dearden, head of the charity Global Justice Now, says: “Big tech companies see vast new markets in providing tech-based versions of healthcare and education, particularly in Africa. The problem is that such private ‘solutions’ are already failing the majority, because they sideline and crowd out investment in decent, high quality, universal education and healthcare, which many lower-income countries desperately need.”Dearden adds: “Patented, tech-based education can easily be tailored to suit different income categories, with the poorest being totally shut out or given a much lower level of service than richer people. What’s more, countries will be locked into services which can only be provided by specific hi-tech companies for years or decades… This should worry all of us – because Africa is a guinea pig for a world totally controlled by a handful of mega corporations.”Tech industry lobbyists argue that developing-world governments will benefit from billions of pounds of research and development carried out by US firms over the past decade. This will help countries put in a modern digital infrastructure, they say, and save huge sums on education and healthcare budgets. But Silicon Valley’s aspirations to make the world smaller and bring people together, no matter how sincere, are being met with more cynicism than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"im worth more than what i put on my face","story":"Cook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsCook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsIn my life, I’ve inhabited many different worlds. I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8228594248d496d90a99ed3467af560cf9484b9/0_49_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7971edc25b677a0e94ec527122b55439","title":"has british museum scored spectacular goal mo salah football boots","story":"National museums, at least in the west, often exist in an uneasy relationship to history and identity in our modern age – and the British Museum has one of the trickiest roles. Long criticised by many as an anachronistic bastion of cultural imperialism, stuffed with the spoils of our entitled violations, it has increasingly found itself on the back foot, forced to defend its “appropriation” of other people’s cultural booty in the face of repeated calls for restitution.While the most celebrated and contested of all the looted treasures remain the Parthenon marbles – their return championed by public figures from Lord Byron to Amal Clooney – we’ve pilfered quite a bit from the Egyptians, too, and they’re not happy about it either. In 2010, the head of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities hosted a two-day conference in Cairo that ended with a demand that the British Museum return ancient artefacts to their country of origin, beginning with Egypt’s Rosetta Stone.So in this ongoing climate of recrimination and post-colonial defensiveness, it makes a change to see the British Museum acquire a new Egyptian treasure that’s been donated voluntarily by an Egyptian king, of sorts.I refer, of course, to Mohamed Salah’s mint-green football boots, given by Adidas on the occasion of his winning the Golden Boot award as this season’s top scorer in the Premier League. The boots will feature as a temporary part of the BM’s Egyptian collection, to be displayed next to a pair of ancient Egyptian sandals (number of goals unknown) near the mummies, as part of a drive to better reflect contemporary Egyptian life. The museum’s keeper of ancient Egypt and Sudan, Neal Spencer, said: “The boots tell the story of a modern Egyptian icon, performing in the UK, with a truly global impact.”Is this progress? It’s by no means the weirdest museum exhibit in London that award might go to the merman sculpture made of fish remains at the Horniman Museum in Lewisham or the celebrity stool samples in Hackney’s Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities. It’s possible that Salah’s boots might be an effective way to tempt kids into the museum, except that if you can’t get your children into a gallery that already has 2,000-year-old dessicated corpses in it, will a pair of unworn boots have much pull? The exhibit has already caused controversy in Egypt, with a former minister of state for antiquities denouncing it as disrespectful to place the boots next to sacred\u0026nbsptreasures.I can’t help feeling that the boots are unwittingly revealing far more about our confused British sense of self at this point in history. Even as some among us cling to a misplaced pride in empire and the invention of football, we’re constantly having our faces rubbed in the fact that our age of dominance in both is long past the publicity photographs of Saleh’s boots in front of the giant statue of Ramesses II serve as a reminder that much of the best of our culture has been imported from elsewhere.It would be progress if we were better at acknowledging and celebrating that in a wider sense, rather than fetishising the footwear of one exceptionally talented Egyptian the way we’ve previously fetishised their carvings and dead bodies, while also insisting on our right to hang on to them.The project to expand the museum’s Egypt collections to illustrate the country’s contemporary history is laudable, not least because they’re going to need new exhibits to fill the gaps when we inevitably have to give back all the stuff we nicked. But at a time when the England manager, Gareth Southgate, is warning about racism in football, enshrining the footwear of one player, claiming him as both an Egyptian icon and somehow “ours”, in a museum gallery surrounded by the spoils of empire feels like something of a confused\u0026nbspgesture.But if the exhibit is to be more than useful advertising for Adidas, the BM needs to broaden its range of contemporary Egyptian icons. They could have Omar Sharif’s favourite pack of cards. Or one of the condom balloons handed out to police in 2016 by the comedian and satirist Shady H AbuZaid, who was later arrested for the prank. Or anything belonging to the many women arrested and sentenced for protesting in Tahrir Square.Modern icons come in many guises – not all of them with corporate sponsorship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6a97d99d5e479c83c6835d20c3f4bb977126b76/0_0_2848_1709/master/2848.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f47d5b5bee58113d28bf88138bebacb","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Sea otters, an African forest elephant and endangered Francois’ langurs are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21ce76827a5466d94ebc497898dcdf2a01faa613/0_49_3890_2334/master/3890.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=762c218ff5eab0addf54e0a29d358030","title":"cannes film festival 2018 palme dor winners live","story":"Spike Lee’s Trump-baiting comedy BlacKkKlansman takes runner-up grand jury prize, while Capernaum, by Lebanese director Nadine Labaki, comes in thirdHirokazu Kore-eda is perhaps unknown among mainstream audiences but is a bit of a heavyweight in independent cinema.

If Rodgers was not revered by Celtic’s followers before, he will be now. This now famous Celtic side, under the guidance of the 45-year-old, has marched into the history books again and with consummate ease.Jock Stein could not return successive domestic trebles when in charge of Celtic. Neither could Martin O’Neill. No Scottish side had achieved back-to-back clean sweeps until this sunny afternoon on Glasgow’s south side, when Motherwell were left chasing shadows. Sometimes football really is blissfully simple this encounter perfectly encapsulated what should happen when a dominant force meets the side who finished seventh in the top flight. Any sense that Celtic’s support are growing bored by their monopoly was undermined by the scale – and sound – of their celebrations here.Rodgers, whose career in management lacked tangible reward before the arrival at his boyhood heroes, has now won six trophies from a possible six. But for the European stage, where Celtic have struggled to make an impact under the former Liverpool manager, Rodgers would be running out of targets. Steven Gerrard’s imminent arrival at Rangers has generated considerable interest but the chasm between Celtic and the rest in Scotland should not be underplayed. Occasions such as this only highlight as much.The outcome was apparent from its early stages. It was wholly fitting that Callum McGregor not only set Celtic on course for victory but remained a prominent figure as Motherwell grasped desperately for air. McGregor’s career was not exactly stagnating before Rodgers took office but the improvement in the midfielder has been stunning.There is a legitimate argument that the development of McGregor, James Forrest, Tom Rogic and Kieran Tierney has been far more of a Celtic success story for Rodgers than what he has derived from the transfer market. McGregor was curiously omitted from player of the year lists there have been few, if any, more consistent players in Scotland this season.Motherwell’s manager, Stephen Robinson, can cite sloppiness in Charles Dunne’s 11th-minute clearance. Still, McGregor had work to do when pouncing on the ball 20 yards from goal. The 24-year-old displayed wonderful technique to slam a half-volley into Trevor Carson’s net via the inside of his right post.Motherwell had not been comprehensively outplayed by this stage but their plan was always likely to collapse with the loss of the opening goal. Their task was to become even more stern before the interval as Olivier Ntcham, now an integral part of Rodgers’s plans after a slow start upon arrival from Manchester City, collected a layoff from Moussa Dembélé before drilling a low finish beyond Carson. With just 25 minutes played, it was impossible to ignore the sense that this tie was over.Motherwell were afforded an opportunity in the 28th minute that they really needed to take. Curtis Main, handed a rare sight of goal as Celtic’s central defence dozed, blazed high over Craig Gordon’s crossbar.Celtic should have been further ahead by the interval, Rogic instead placing a tame effort into the hands of Carson.Main was denied by a fine Gordon save, three minutes after the restart, as Motherwell chased salvation. Yet it was Celtic who continued to dominate the ball and, in turn, the match. Rodgers and his players appealed in vain for a penalty as Dembélé tumbled under a challenge from Tom Aldred. The France striker subsequently fired wide from close range, Forrest having created the chance. Dembélé’s next chance saw Carson produce a stunning save to thwart a header.To their credit, Motherwell did not curl into a submissive position and finished on the front foot. Chris Cadden capitalised on slack play by Scott Brown before charging towards the Celtic penalty area. Dedryck Boyata hauled Cadden back, a yard from where a penalty would have been awarded. Gaël Bigirimana cracked the resultant Motherwell free-kick against the bar.In what may well be his final Celtic appearance, the excellent Dembélé was denied the goal he appeared desperate for. Another winner’s medal will serve as reasonable consolation. Rodgers has made the receipt of silverware a Celtic formality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5cb111811fb17581901d9a350f65fae7c530777/0_0_2766_1659/master/2766.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=622e5714d018f92020f639bf3d3c776a","title":"chelsea manchester united fa cup match report","story":"If this turns out to be Antonio Conte’s final game as Chelsea manager, as all the evidence suggests, at least he has gone out on a high.For all the politics at Stamford Bridge, all the discontent and the impression of a manager who knows his time is up, another trophy has been added to the collection. Last year, the Premier League, this season, the FA Cup only at Chelsea, perhaps, could a manager with that haul now be cut free.A parting of the ways feels like a fait accompli even though Chelsea have just won the eighth FA Cup of their history, an achievement that moves them level with Tottenham Hotspur in third place on the all-time list.Conte looked happy for the first time in a long while and, on this evidence, Chelsea surely cannot allow Eden Hazard to contemplate following him.Hazard’s first-half penalty was the difference between the two sides and the Belgian certainly chose a good day to have one of his better performances of the season.Chelsea had to withstand some concerted second-half pressure but José Mourinho’s team lacked finesse in the important areas.In many ways, it has been the story of Manchester United’s season. They have finished without any silverware and this was another occasion when it was obvious, whatever slant Mourinho wants to put on it, that United are still a long way short of being a top team. Or, at least, the team they were in happier times.The disappointing part was the lack of refinement from the two teams that finished second and fifth in the Premier League, featuring some of the more celebrated players in English football’s top ision.The game hotted up in the second half, but it was a disappointing spectacle at times, lacking any real sophistication and a reminder, perhaps, of why it always had the feel of a papering-over-the-cracks final. United finished 19 points behind Manchester City, with Chelsea 30 adrift of the top, and nobody could have left Wembley thinking that the gulf felt like a deception.These should be the moments when category-A players such as Paul Pogba and Alexis Sánchez have a clear influence. Instead, it took a long time before United found any cohesion in the attacking positions and\u0026nbspHazard was always the most dangerous player.His speed and trickery is nothing new but the most impressive part of his performance was his absolute determination that the final should not pass him by. Unfortunately for Mourinho, the same could not be said of some of his front players.Hazard’s contribution was impressive for the fact he had Ander Herrera in close proximity throughout most of the match. Herrera has been deployed in this role against Hazard before, including one occasion when it led to the United player being show a red card. He stuck to his task diligently, quick over the ground and strong in the tackle, but Hazard’s elusive qualities will always make him a dangerous opponent to track.In the 21st minute, he drifted away from his usual position on the left side of Chelsea’s attack to move to the inside-right channel. This time, Herrera left Phil Jones to deal with him and there was already evidence to suggest the United centre-half was having one of his more accident-prone performances. Jones is too often liable to these kind of calamities.His first mistake was to back off as Cesc Fàbregas curled the ball to his team-mate. Hazard came for the ball, his first touch left Jones stranded, and United were in trouble as soon as the Chelsea player started picking up speed.Conte was enraged that Jones avoided being sent off for the flailing, desperate challenge that brought down Hazard inside the penalty area. It was a clear penalty and the referee, Michael Oliver, was surrounded by Chelsea players wanting to know why it was not a red card.Conte still looked incensed even after Hazard had expertly rolled the penalty to David de Gea’s left, but it was correct for Oliver to deem it a booking if he thought Jones had made a legitimate attempt to play the ball. In that case, the regulations state referees ought to show a yellow card, regardless of whether it denies a goalscoring opportunity.After that, United had little choice but to start playing more adventurously, but it was not until the opening 10 minutes of the second half that they\u0026nbspstarted to pin back their opponents.The width was provided by their full-backs, Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia, and it needed a fine save from Thibaut Courtois to prevent Jones from equalising with a header from Marcus Rashford’s free-kick. Sánchez turned in the rebound, but he had strayed marginally offside in the process and the linesman’s flag cut short the celebrations.Not long afterwards, Courtois had to dash off his goalline to deny Rashford and that was the point of the match, with 73 minutes gone, when Mourinho brought on Romelu Lukaku as a substitute.Lukaku had not been deemed fit enough to start because of the ankle\u0026nbspinjury that has kept him out recently and he struggled to have any real impact.Antonio Rüdiger, in particular, stood out in Chelsea’s defence. Gary Cahill has rediscovered his best form \u0026nbspand, in the closing minutes, when an onslaught might have been\u0026nbspexpected, Conte’s men were largely untroubled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1909918cdc70a2687e49b81db0021e9c3f5444d5/29_283_5145_3087/master/5145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c5920453ed546abed8053e8c4107b5e","title":"manchester city struggle to make champions league","story":"In April Nick Cushing’s charges were on course for the treble of WSL, FA Cup and Champions League. A few weeks later and securing second place is all that remains open to themWhen Manchester City announced that their women’s team would be embarking on a ground-breaking tour of the United States this summer a glorious treble remained within the grasp of Nick Cushing’s side.It was April and optimism at the Etihad Campus, where Cushing’s players share many facilities with Pep Guardiola’s Premier League champions, was high. Then the setbacks began. First, City lost an FA Cup semi-final to Emma Hayes’s Chelsea and then Lyon knocked them out at the same stage of the Champions League, before Hayes’s team clinched the Women’s Super League title.Now one final, potentially crushing, disappointment must be avoided. With a renascent Arsenal only one point behind City going into Sunday afternoon’s final round of WSL fixtures, they dare not stumble at home to Everton. A slip could permit Joe Montemurro’s players, who travel to Bristol City, to leapfrog into second place and snatch the ision’s last Champions League slot.In March Arsenal beat Cushing’s side in the Continental Cup final, ensuring there would be no repeat of the domestic double secured in 2016, the last full campaign before the game’s switch from a summer to a winter schedule.“It’s been a disappointing season,” concedes City’s England forward Nikita Parris. “But we’re still so close to qualifying for the Champions League. We’ve got a lot of young, developing players so we’re in a good place. Qualifying is massive. We’re determined to do it. It’s what this club needs.”A team apparently running on empty also look in need of a good rest before they face Paris Saint-Germain, North Carolina Courage and Chelsea at the inaugural International Champions Cup in Miami in late July. A training camp in Oregon follows but, for several of Cushing’s players, the American trip comes tightly sandwiched between World Cup qualifiers with England involving away dates in Russia in June and Wales in August.The presence of so many key components of Phil Neville’s squad in their ranks is both a blessing and a curse for City. Tellingly 10 of the starting XI Cushing deployed for the goalless Champions League semi-final first leg against Lyon had been called up by Neville this year, with the Lionesses’ participation in March’s SheBelieves Cup in the United States proving exhausting.For a time before Neville’s appointment City feared losing Cushing to England but the 33-year-old eventually withdrew from the FA’s shortlist, signing a new club contract. Off-pitch turmoil was averted but on it the absence of City’s captain, the centre-half Steph Houghton, with an ankle injury contributed to some vital points being dropped during February.By then the departures last summer of the outstanding England right-back Lucy Bronze to Lyon and the forward Toni Duggan to Barcelona were really being felt. Perhaps inevitably an expertly volleyed goal from Bronze gave Lyon a 1-0 aggregate Champions League win against her old club – the French champions face Wolfsburg in Kiev on Thursday.With City’s new Denmark striker Nadia Nadim struggling, Chelsea have proved the infinitely better-balanced unit. Significantly, the shortlist for the PFA female player of the year comprised five Chelsea stars and City’s Jill Scott. The award was deservedly won by Fran Kirby the Chelsea forward blessed with a rare ability to play between the lines has barely stopped scoring this season.Hayes, who gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Thursday when Chelsea announced that the other twin she was expecting had sadly “failed to make it”, is undoubtedly an exceptional coach but Kirby’s catalytic presence remains the overwhelming reason for the six-point gap separating the top two.This gulf will not have gone down well with City’s Abu Dhabi-based ownership. Ditto the disappointing average attendances of around 1,500 at the women’s 7,000-capacity Academy Stadium. But next season offers a prospective new dawn and, in Keira Walsh, Mel Lawley and Georgia Stanway, Cushing has three of England’s brightest emerging talents.In 12 months that trio could well be preparing for the 2019 World Cup in France having helped City reclaim the game’s glittering prizes. First though a Champions League place needs guaranteeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80b187e48b222dca08d4ef9c4c38caae3b7a1660/0_195_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04be0ea9a1bcfa4f30d84f1e0d160758","title":"celtic v motherwell 2018 scottish cup final live","story":"Celtic secured an unprecedented Scottish domestic “double treble” with a fairly routine win over Motherwell at Hampden Park Scott Brown hoists the world’s oldest national trophy, then passes it back down the line to his team-mates who take turns lifting it after receiving their medals. One man who won’t be getting a medal, despite deserving one for the speed with which he filed his on-the-whistle match report, is Ewan Murray. He was at Hampden Park for the . Motherwell’s players collect their losers medals. They look understandably disconsolate, but there’s no shame whatsoever in being outclassed by a Celtic team that’s co much wealthier than their outfit. They’ll probably think they could have offered more and that’s what will rankle.It was easy for Celtic in the end: Motherwell just didn’t turn up and despite the Celtic’s platitudes, didn’t give a very good account of themselves. Callum McGregor scored a wonderful goal on the half-volley in the 11th minute and from that point on there was only going to be one winner. Olivier Ntcham rounded off a successful first season for Celtic with a comparatively scruffy goal on 25 minutes and Celtic continued to dominate. They took their foot off the gas in the second half and Motherwell had chances to equalise. Carl Bigirimana had the best of them, rattling the woodwork with a free-kick that came so close to frightening the life out of Celtic with 10 minutes to go.“It’s exceptional,” says the Celtic captain in an interview with Sky Sports. “These fans deserve it more than anyone. The lads have worked so hard in the last two seasons and again, Motherwell things difficult for us. It’s been phenomenal.”Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It’s all over! A comfortable win for Celtic wins them the Scottish Cup and secures an unprecedented double treble.90+3 min: Celtic play keep-ball in the corner to pass the final minute of added time. 90+1 min: Moussa Dembele’s latest attempt to get on the scoresheet is foiled by Cedric Kipre, who gets in an important challenge as the Celtic man tried to cut inside on his left foot and shoot.90 min: Scott Brown picks out Scott Sinclair running into space on the left flank with a wonderful long diagonal pass, but the substitute runs into traffic as he attempts to create room for a shot. 89 min: Celtic substitution: Scott Sinclair on for James Forrest, who’s had an excellent game. 87 min: Richard Tait sends a cross into the penalty area, where Chris Cadden tries to steer a header in at the far post. His glancing effort goes wide and wouldn’t have counted if it had gone in, as he was offside. 85 min: Carl Bigirimana curls the ball into the Celtic penalty area, but their opponents clear. After their outstanding play of the first half, the league champions have been quite indolent since the break. A late Motherwell goal would give them plenty to think about.83 min: incidentally, the linesman who provided the unintentional comic relief by falling over his own feet earlier is Douglas Ross, the Conservative MP for Moray. 82 min: Inside the final 10 minutes and Celtic continue to trail by two goals. They win a corner, which Elliott Frear sends into the penalty area. Tom Aldred wins the header, but it’s easy for Craig Gordon.80 min: From just inside the D on the edge of the Celtic penalty area, Gael Bigirimana steps up to take the free-kick and he goes so, so close. He rattles the cross-bar with his effort, which had Craig Gordon well beaten.79 min: Motherwell win a free-kick in a great position on the edge of the Celtic penalty area after Dedryck Boyata tugs the shirt of Chris Cadden, who was bearing down on goal. Boyata avoids a red, as Kieran Tierney was on hand to cover.78 min: James Forrest whips the ball across the edge of the six-yard box, trying to pick out Moussa Dembele, but Tom Aldred does a good job in defence for Motherwell. Dembele really deserves a goal here - he’s been outstanding.77 min: Celtic win a corner from which nothing comes, followed by some comic relief from one of the referee’s assistants, who trips over his own feet while trying to get out of the way of the ball as it comes his way.75 min: Another Celtic substitution: Kristoffer Ajer off with some sort of niggle, Jozo Simunovic on.70 min: Dembele misses two great chances in quick succession. He gets on the end of a Callum McGregor cross from the right and sends a bullet-header towards the top corner. Somehow, brilliantly ... Trevor Carson saves, getting one hand to the ball and keeping it out. The Motherwell goalkeeper then gets down to save the follow up, also from Dembele, with his feet.67 min: Half-chances for both sides, which are missed by Dembele and Bigirimana. Dembele really should have done better, shooting wide from an excellent position and the Motherwell goal apparently at his mercy.64 min: Moussa Dembele is terrorising the Motherwell defence this afternoon. Spotting him out of the corner of his eye, Cedric Kipre panics and launches a bouncing ball into the stands rather than control it and pass back to his goalkeeper.64 min: Motherwell get a rare shot on goal, but Chris Cadden fires straight at Craig Gordon. 62 min: Another booking for Motherwell, as Allan Campbell has his name taken for a late challenge on Scott Brown.59 min: Ryan Bowman is penalised for a nasty studs-up challenge on Mikael Lustig, who wins a free-kick deep inside his own half. The ball is thumped long to Moussa Dembele, who clearly has his jersey pulled by Tom Aldred as he wins, but only half-controls, the ball in the Motherwell penalty area. Celtic’s players and fans appeal for a spot-kick, but don’t get one.56 min: Motherwell substitute: Carl McHugh off, Gael Bigirimana on. The skipper is replaced and Ryan Bowman takes the armband.54 min: A lightning fast Celtic counter-attack, again involving Kieran Tierney, ends with James Forrest miscuing horribly and screwing a decent chance horribly wide from the edge of the area.52 min: Another cross from Tierney results in a Celtic corner. Olivier Ntcham’s delivery is atrocious.51 min: A constant threat on the left, Kieran Tierney whips a low cross into the penalty area, trying to tee up Moussa Dembele for a tap-in. Trevor Carson is quick off his line to foil the striker. 50 min: Tom Rogic drives forward from midfield with the ball at his feet and tries a shot, which takes a deflection away from goal. 49 min: Allan Campbell gets a sight of goal and tries his luck from distance. His long range effort is on target, but Craig Gordon saves comfortably. 47 min: Chance! Curtis Main brings a good save out of Craig Gordon after getting on the end of a pull-back from the by-line. The Celtic goalkeeper gets a strong hand to the ball and puts it out for a corner, from which nothing comes. The chance came on the back of good work down the right wing from Chris Cadden, who’s been moved further forward.46 min: Motherwell get the ball rolling for the second half, needing to score next to have any chance of clawing their way back into this final. They started reasonably well, but were completely outclassed from the 10th minute on. Celtic get forward immediately and Kieran Tierney sends a cross towards Mooussa Dembele. Trevor Carson claims well.It’s been men against boys for most of the first half and Celtic look home and hosed already. Callum McGregor and Olivier Ntcham got the goals against a Motherwell side that appear to have no answers whatsoever for the many difficult questions they are being posed. They’ve had a couple of half-chances without ever really threatening and seem to be resorting to bully-boy tactics in the absence of any better ideas on how to compete.Celtic won’t mind that one bit and if Motherwell get a man sent off, as seems likely, any faint hope they have of getting back in this contest will disappear down the tunnel with him.45 min: Crikey! There’s another late tackle on Tierney, this time from Allan Campbell, who escapes a booking. 44 min: Liam Grimshaw gets booked for a late barge on Kieran Tierney. Their players seem to think they can intimidate the (vastly experienced) youngster, but he’s making mugs of them at the moment. 42 min: Another counter-attack from Celtic, with Dembele showing great strength to muscle his way up the centre of the pitch with Callum McGregor up in support. Dembele tries to play him through on goal, but puts too much welly on his pass and a good opportunity goes begging. Motherwell looked very stretched at the back there.40 min: Motherwell win a free-kick about a third of the way inside the Celtic half. The ball’s played to Cadden at the edge of the penalty area, he tries to pick out Curtis Main, but the ball runs wide.39 min: Motherwell win a corner. The ball’s lofted in the Celtic penalty area, where Dedryck Boyata heads clear.38 min: Assuming they go on to win this final, Celtic will have an open-top bus parade back to Celtic Park afterwards. Then, after a night of presumably alcohol-drenched celebrations, they and their fans have to rouse themselves for Scott Brown’s testimonial against a - sound the cliche klaxon - Republic of Ireland XI tomorrow.37 min: Just before that booking, Tom Rogic missed a decent chance to further increase Celtic’s lead, but stabbed the ball straight at Carson when it fell to him near the penalty spot. 36 min: Richard Tait gets the first yellow card of the game for leaving one in on Kieran Tierney as the Celtic defender attempted a clearance. It’s been a noticable tactic from Motherwell’s players and quite a few have got spoken to about it by the referee, who has obviously run out of patience.34 min: Olivier Ntcham did a series of acrobatic somersaults by way of celebration for his goal and looking at replay now, it’s funny to see how his team-mates were very careful to wait until he was finished before going to congratulate him. 31 min: Celtic continue to dominate and just a third of the way in, it’s difficult to see any back for Motherwell. They’re being completely outclassed, much like our Scottish football correspondent Ewan Murray predicted.29 min: A tip of the hat to Moussa Dembele, whose hold-up play in the lead up to Celtic’s second was outstanding. He laid it off to Ntcham, who didn’t catch the ball particularly well, but hit it accurately enough to go in the bottom corner. Motherwell defender Cedric Kipre turned his back to the ball and it clipped his heel on the way in, leaving goalkeeper Trevor Carson with no chance.28 min: Curtis Main tries his luck from distance for Motherwell, but fires over the bar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae7038d99648cdf1417a9ae90c9049c05afb92ad/0_138_3657_2194/master/3657.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a17fccba3fa775892a6a7788a2de41a","title":"chelsea v manchester united 2018 fa cup final live","story":"Jose Mourinho speaks. “I congratulate them because they won, but I don’t think they deserve to win. I congratulate because I am a sportsman. They score one more goal than us and they get the cup, and I have to do what my job asks me to do: I am the Manchester United manager and I have to be respectful, not just because they were my previous club, but because they are the opponent that won the cup. But I think we deserved to win, we were the best team, but that’s football. I am curious to know what you say, what people write, because I can imagine if my team played like Chelsea did, I can imagine what everyone will say. I am quite curious. But I am on holiday. I gave everything I could, I know the players gave everything, it was hard for us to play without Lukaku against a team who play nine players in the box, you need that presence. They are not stupid, they know without Lukaku we don’t have a presence, without Fellaini we don’t have a presence, so with eight or nine players in the box, they knew they were going to be dominant. For me the image of the game is that David de Gea didn’t touch the ball. We did everything, we tried, it’s the kind of defeat, while it hurts, we gave everything, no regrets.”The prize-giving ceremony. United go up to collect their runners-up medals, grim-faced to a man. Commiserations to them. Then it’s the turn of Chelsea, who climb the steps to lift their shiny new trophy. It’s awarded to a jubilant Gary Cahill by Jackie Wilkins, the widow of Chelsea and United legend Ray. Blue is the Colour blasts out of the PA. Ticker tape rains down. And eventually Antonio Conte - beaming, vindicated - takes his turn to hoist it. Plenty of cheering all round ... with the defeated United team sportingly looking on.The match-winner Eden Hazard speaks! “We tried to defend well. We scored one goal, it’s enough today. Though if we want to win a lot of games, we need to play better, because we just played defensively. But we won it and we are happy.” He’s then asked about his future. “Now I’m just happy. We didn’t play a great season, but we finished well.”Gary Cahill speaks! “It’s unbelievable. This was to save our season. I’m not saying we’ve had a magnificent season by any stretch, but we have to try to win things. We had a lot of defending to do. They pushed us to the line. We’re buzzing, we got the job done. This is a dream come true, as this is the first one as captain.” He’s then asked if he wants Conte to be here next season: “Listen, we needed to achieve this goal for everybody, no matter what happens in the future. We’re not in control of that as players. I’m sure the club and himself will make the best decision. Who knows what’s going to happen?”OK, it wasn’t a classic. But should Chelsea care? Nope! They’ve just won the FA Cup for the eighth time in their history! It’s the first cup victory on Conte’s managerial CV. And a first domestic cup defeat in England for Mourinho. Chelsea were the better side in the first half, and defended with great purpose in the second. United only really showed what they could do after the restart. But chances were at a premium for both sides, and Pogba missed United’s golden opportunity to equalise with that free header in the closing stages. Chelsea were the deserved winners, even if the contest was tight.Yep! Chelsea have won the 2018 FA Cup! On the touchline, Conte leaps around in joy ... before giving his old foe Mourinho a hug.90 min +5: Willian threatens to burst clear down the left. Mata is forced to toe-poke out for a corner. That’s surely it.90 min +4: Now Mata crosses from the right ... and forces Moses to eyebrow out for a corner ... which is sent straight down the throat of Courtois!90 min +3: Valencia crosses high from the right. Matic goes up to meet it, but his header flies harmlessly high and wide right. Courtois is booked for taking an age over the resulting goal kick.90 min +2: Chelsea continue to keep United pressed deep in their own half.90 min +1: Willian’s first act is to run at United down the left. He can’t break clear into the box, but United need a goal and they’re being pressed back at the wrong end of the pitch.90 min: Hazard bursts down the left, a gorgeous ball-on-string dribble in the circumstances, and wins a corner off Mata. It gives them opportunity to faff in the corner. They win a throw. Then Willian comes on for Hazard. A brave call if United force an equaliser and take the match to extra time ... and there’s five extra minutes to be added!89 min: Morata comes on for the very hard-working Giroud.88 min: Young slips a pass down the inside-left for Sanchez, just inside the box but with his back to goal. There’s a sea of blue shirts behind him. Sanchez lays off to Martial, who tries to float one, George Best style, into the net from a daft angle on the left. It flies harmlessly over the bar.87 min: Mata comes on for Jones. It’s fair to say this is symbolic of a change of artistic intention.86 min: Hazard and Fabregas take the ball for a walk down the right. Their perambulations eat up 60 seconds or so.85 min: Sanchez sends a low fizzer wide left from 20 yards. He wants a corner for a deflection - he is livid - but he’s not going to get it.84 min: Wembley is a very tense place. United are pressing Chelsea back again, but still there’s no way through.82 min: This is end-to-end now. Hazard dribbles down the Chelsea left but is stopped by Smalling. Martial threatens to break down the United left and earns a corner. From which Pogba is found, alone on the penalty spot, but he sends his free header wide right when it was surely easier to get something, anything, on target! He holds his head in his hands. What a chance that was!80 min: Matic shoots from 25 yards. It’s a rising missile, and Courtois does very well to punch it around the post. From the corner, Martial has a dig from the edge of the box. Azpilicueta gets in the way and the deflected shot loops into the hands of the keeper.79 min: Jones is back on. A rare period of possession for Chelsea. They stroke it around the middle in the professional, clock-bothering style. How they’ve needed this, in the face of United’s near relentless attack since the restart.77 min: At first, Giroud looked to have come off worse, but he’s up and about soon enough. Jones has cut his head open, though, and needs taping up. He’s off getting those running repairs.75 min: Valencia robs Alonso down the right and tees up Martial, whose shot is deflected softly into Courtois’ arms. Then up the field, Giroud is nutted in the back of the head by Jones as the pair contest a high ball. Ooyah, oof.73 min: Lingard puts Rashford clear down the inside-right channel. Rashford draws Courtois but his shot is tipped away by the keeper. A wonderful save. At which point United make a change, Lingard and Rashford making way for Martial and Lukaku.71 min: A huge chance for Chelsea to score a second! Kante drives at the United box, then feeds Alonso on his right. Alonso takes too long and shoots low towards the near corner, and de Gea’s not going to be beaten from there. He parries. Moses latches onto the loose ball, to the right of goal, and tries to flick it past Young. The ball hits Young’s arm, which moved a little towards the ball. The decision goes to VAR, but there’s no penalty given. Perhaps Young was too close to act, but that’s a contentious decision all right. There’ll be debates of course, but it looked like a penalty.69 min: Lingard earns a United corner down the right. What follows is not much cop. But since coming out for the second half revived, United have done everything but score.67 min: Young goes down the left and is blocked by Azpilicueta. He doesn’t get the free kick, and takes out his frustration by getting up in the Chelsea player’s grille. For a split second, it threatens to boil over. Play nicely, everyone.66 min: This is still all United. Valencia tries to break clear down the right, but can’t find a gap in the blue line. Chelsea surely can’t keep soaking up this pressure, though. They’re giving the ball away with metronomic regularity.64 min: A brief pause as Courtois recovers from that good old stretch, while the offside decision is checked by the VAR. It’s fine. We play on.63 min: Rashford is bowled over on the right. Free kick, which he takes himself. Jones, on the penalty spot, guides a header towards the bottom right. It’s heading in! But Courtois stretches to claw it out. However, Sanchez is lurking, and knees the rebound into the net. He wheels off to celebrate ... but the flag goes up for offside. It’s the correct decision, though it was very close.61 min: Rudiger lashes a long pass down the left wing. Hazard scampers after it, races along the touchline, and then zips down the byline. It’s like a game of Amidar. He thrashes a shot-cum-cross straight at de Gea, who handles well.59 min: United are dominating possession and territory. Chelsea are finding it very hard to get out of their final third. And this time United are asking serious questions. Matic has a shot which bobbles harmlessly wide ... but they’re racking up some chances now. On the touchline, Mourinho applauds his men.57 min: Pogba shoots and wins a corner ... from which Chelsea break upfield. Hazard tears past Herrera, then cuts inside, past Valencia. He’s upended, and that’s Valencia in the book.56 min: Herrera splits Chelsea’s back four with a slide-rule pass down the inside right that releases Valencia. The right back is clear in the area, but looks for a pullback instead of shooting. Rashford has a blast that’s parried by Courtois. Pogba tries again, but lifts a soft one into the keeper’s hands. This is miles better from United ... though Valencia might reflect that he really should have had a shot himself.55 min: Chelsea are sitting deep and living dangerously. Lingard dribbles his way into the box and causes some bedlam. Chelsea half clear. Herrera slips a pass down the left and Young floats a chip over the bar from an ambitious angle.53 min: Rashford curls a vicious free kick into the mixer. It might even have been a direct shot. Either way, Pogba rises but just misses his attempted header, six yards out. Courtois punches out bravely in the middle of a crowded box. United are on top here.52 min: Young dribbles his way down the left and goes over the outstretched leg of Moses. That was a slightly cheeky one, he bought that very cheaply. It’s a free kick to the left of the Chelsea box, though, in a very dangerous position.50 min: Hazard is down, having taken an accidental finger in the eye from Smalling in a midfield tussle. Or maybe it was a crack across the nose. Either way, he’ll be fine to continue. A splash of water on the face and a dap with a sponge will do the trick. Pleasingly old-fashioned treatment.48 min: United have been first to pretty much everything since the break. Chelsea haven’t come out for the second half yet.46 min: Pogba, dropping deep, spreads a lovely pass wide right for Rashford, who lays off to Sanchez, who slides the ball wide right for Valencia. The resulting attempt at a cross comes off Alonso then back off Valencia for a goal kick, but it looks like United are determined to play at a higher tempo. That was much better.And we’re off again! Chelsea get the second half underway. No changes.Half-time entertainment, courtesy of Norman ‘a song, a smile, a piano’ Long. As 78rpm platters go, Long’s 1928 release Why Is The Bacon So Tough?  Never Have A Bath With Your Wrist Watch On is hard to beat. But it’s cup final day, and Chelsea are playing, so here’s his 1933 classic On The Day That Chelsea Went And Won The Cup. The conceit doesn’t quite hold post 1970, admittedly, but let’s go with it. “The sun came out in Manchester and funny things like that ...”Giroud nearly releases Hazard into the United box with a cute first-time cushioned pass. United flood up the other end, Pogba driving into the area from the left, Rashford miskicking at a chance from the penalty spot. Rudiger hacks clear, and the players trot off to the changing room for their half-time tactical de-brief. Those last 60 seconds of the half were the most exciting yet! Typical. Another 45 minutes like that, then, please!45 min: ... United create their best chance of the game so far! The ball’s worked to Young, out on the left. He sends an inswinger to the far post. Jones rises highest, but can only head wide right from close range. A tight angle, to be fair.44 min: Young drops a shoulder to circumvent Moses on the outside, but is cynically shoulder-barged to the floor. A free kick. It should have been a booking, but no. From the set piece, a corner. And from that ...42 min: Matic, of all people, channels his inner Garrincha and nearly twinkle-toes his way through a small gap down the left. Chelsea shut that door quickly enough. United have done next to nothing in attack so far. On the touchline, Mourinho looks accordingly frustrated.40 min: Fabregas hits the corner, from the left, long. De Gea rises and a telescopic arm extends to punch the ball away. Fine keeping with the likes of Giroud lurking with intent. 39 min: Hazard nips through a small gap between Pogba and Lingard, and is fouled by both of them at once. The resulting free kick is hoicked into the mixer, and Smalling is panicked enough to head straight out for a corner.38 min: Pogba’s work earns United a corner on the left. Sanchez tries to curl a saucy one straight into the net, but Fabregas is guarding the near post and heads out for another corner. That second one goes straight down Courtois’ throat.36 min: Fabregas batters one witlessly straight into the wall. This is not a classic. But there have been many worse finals over the years, and there’s still plenty of time to go.35 min: Sanchez clips the heel of Bakayoko, who was threatening to break into the United box down the left. A free kick in a very dangerous position, just to the left of the D.34 min: This is very bitty. Chelsea nudge the action up to the middle of the park, away from their goal, where both teams faff awhile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95315c70e5612b93d2b97930f1f360881bfd0336/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5f77184ec855d3ed49cafd6513aaeb4","title":"blind date rory emma embarrassing tattoos","story":"What were you hoping for?An interesting person to speak to and a nice bottle of wine.First impressions?Kind eyes and a good haircut.What did you talk about?Loads, because I kept going off on tangents.

It was an eye-opener for him, showing how people who arrived with nothing have recreated a tiny slice of their lives back home, mostly in Syria. “They are thrown together, given a basic shelter. It was humbling to see how important gardening and growing is to them and how much benefit green space gives,” he says.When the Lemon Tree Trust, which is sponsoring the garden, asked refugees what they missed most about home, they talked about the sounds of nature, their gardens, and trees. Many of them asked for seeds. They had begun raising songbirds and pigeons, crafting elaborate fountains from concrete, and carving productive beds from the dusty soil.And while Chelsea may be a world away from the fragile, harsh existence of a Domiz plot, the trust’s CEO, Stephanie Hunt, hopes visitors will be able to relate “gardener to gardener” to the story the garden will tell. “We wanted to elevate the discussion around refugees, and show they are more than the pain and hardship that they have seen – they want to move on, and their gardens bring them joy.”Massey’s show garden uses the same limited set of raw materials that the 26,000 refugees at Domiz have access to – concrete and steel – plus ordinary objects they repurpose, from tin drums to plastic bottles. At the centre is an Islamic-inspired fountain fed by rills of water that radiate from it one of the boundary walls is covered with gutter pipes and cans filled with plants and fig, pomegranate and lemon trees offer shade, scent and food. “Lots of people I met said their gardens are places for escape, so I wanted to create areas where people could sit and listen to running water,” Massey says. “The plants have a strong sensory nature to transport them to other places.”The show garden won’t be a carbon copy of the refugees’ plots. “It has to have a certain Chelsea polish, or it won’t work.” That gloss comes in the form of polished rather than poured concrete, steel cut by laser rather than basic tools, and a palette of plants specially grown by the nursery Hortus Loci.Will the average Chelsea visitor engage with this garden’s message? Massey thinks so, but then, he’s already tested the water: one of the two show gardens he designed at the RHS Hampton Court show in 2016 was sponsored by the UN Refugee Agency. This conceptual garden, called Border Control, highlighted the dangerous journeys refugees make. “It’s nice to see gardens like this at big shows – that it’s not just high-end gardens without much message behind them,” he says.For Massey, it’s been a steep learning curve: he is making his Chelsea debut less than three years after he started practising. He studied animation then went into advertising, but found there was “too much sitting in a dark room”, so retrained as a garden designer. “I have always had a deep connection to the landscape. I grew up in Richmond with the park on my doorstep and spent long summers in Cornwall going a bit feral,” he says.While at Domiz, Massey explored the Mesopotamian plain that surrounds the camp, a bioersity hotspot packed with unfamiliar species. He was accompanied by Dr Sami Youssef, a bioersity expert who had been a refugee in the camp and was instrumental in starting the trust’s growing garden there Youssef had found several previously unrecorded plant species growing nearby. Massey has drawn on Youssef’s knowledge to ensure his own garden uses the right species.“Meeting Sami really underlined that a refugee camp is filled with ordinary people,” Massey says. “Journalists, designers, architects, botanists, farmers, teachers, decorators – all just doing their best to survive.”The Pearlfisher garden, by John Warland, will bring the beauty and fragility of marine life to west London, highlighting the urgent issue of plastic waste in the seas.

I knew all sorts about him, from my mother: that he could knit, for example, and that he adored cricket that he was a social worker and had become the UK’s first director of social services that he was a Quaker, and had been a conscientious objector in the second world war. She also told me that, after the early death of their mother, he had completely failed her and her younger sisters by marrying again very quickly, and more or less abandoning them.It was hard to square her charming portrait of Denis with his failure as a father – and grandfather. For many years, I was haunted by the unbearable sadness of the story, and a desire to better understand what had happened.As it turned out, I was to get my chance: a six-week window at the end of his life to get to know him and solve the puzzle.My mother is the eldest of four. The girls grew up with “all the luxuries and none of the necessities”: a piano, for example, but no curtains. Their mother, Rita, was a great collector of waifs and strays, and their shabby homes (they moved a lot) were always bursting with guests. One of those guests was Marjorie, a young colleague of Denis’s – deaf and very much alone in life. Then Rita died, and Marjorie became Denis’s wife – and the archetypal wicked stepmother.She got rid of all of Rita’s things, including the family dog and, the minute they were old enough, the daughters. Once they had left home, they weren’t welcome back and she didn’t like Denis visiting them. The story made me angry, but with Denis rather than Marjorie. How could he have put Marjorie’s needs over those of his bereaved girls?For my mother, Marjorie was the villain. Like the fathers in the fairytales, Denis was simply mysterious. And yearned for. She put a lot of effort into keeping in contact, sending him letters and birthday cards, and encouraging his rare visits. When he was 70, Denis briefly asserted himself over Marjorie, and invited his daughters and their families to Devon to celebrate his birthday. For me it was an impossibly poignant event. The weather was beautiful, and we picnicked on the beach. My mother and aunts were childlike in their eagerness to connect with their father to please him. Denis, a handsome man with more than a touch of David Attenborough about him, paddled in the sea and got us playing cricket. Marjorie also attended. Shy rather than villainous, her deafness very apparent, she didn’t like the sun and sat away from us in the shade of the cliffs. In contrast, I felt Rita to be everywhere – although her name was never spoken.After the birthday, things returned to as they had been and I didn’t see Denis for seven years. Then in November 1996, when I was 31, my mother phoned to tell me that he was in hospital, dying. He wanted to write a memoir and had requested my assistance, having heard that I had provided such a service to a terminally ill woman a few years before. I said yes straight away. This was my chance to get to know him and maybe get some answers.Denis and Marjorie lived in Exeter. Marjorie, as it happened, was in another hospital having an operation but she didn’t want me staying in their empty house. Quaker friends of Denis’s offered to put me up. I found Denis in a dingy ward, curtained off from the other men. Frail in his hospital gown, he gazed warily at me over his oxygen mask, and I thought for a moment that he didn’t recognise me. But then he removed the mask and reached for my hand. “I’m so glad you’re here,” he said, settling me into the bedside chair. “Have you brought your notebook?”Aware of his impending death, Denis was on a mission. For the next six weeks, he talked slowly, resorting to his mask in between sentences, so it was easy to scribble it all down. Every few days I would type up my scrawls and bring back the printed sheets for his plentiful corrections. As I got to know him, I found myself yearning for a deeper connection – to be more than a scribe. In a bid for intimacy, I told him about the pain of being in love with a man who didn’t love me. He nodded, but said nothing. And then sighed and said, “Shall we get on, then?”It was his memories of childhood that he wanted to capture for posterity. I felt frustrated, wanting to fast forward to events that involved my mother, but I gradually became absorbed in the story he wanted to tell.He had been one of five brothers. His parents had an unhappy marriage. His father, Jack, may have had schizophrenia, or what was then called shellshock, but Denis’s memories were of a kind and caring man. When Denis was four, Jack ran away with him. They went to Suffolk on a motorbike, Denis in the sidecar, thrilled to have been chosen as his father’s partner in adventure. His memory was one of profound happiness, listening to the pop-pop of the engine under the deep green of Suffolk foliage. Then the police found them, Denis was returned to his mother, and Jack was forbidden to darken their door. His mother remarried and went abroad with her new husband, and Denis and his brothers were given charity places at a boarding school.Denis enjoyed school. He played cricket and climbed trees, and fell through the ice of a frozen pond. Sightings of his father were poignant but, as Denis admitted, not necessarily real. Once, when he was playing cricket, Jack materialised on the side of the pitch. Overjoyed, Denis did his best to play well, feeling his father’s eyes on him. When the match was over, he turned towards him – but Jack was gone. I was charmed by this schoolboy, whose vitality triumphed over his sadness and also struck by the theme of abandonment. I felt I was getting an answer to the questions I didn’t dare to ask, an answer that finally took shape during an anecdote about a rare holiday with his mother and brothers in a seaside hotel. One morning, she mentioned almost in passing, that their father had died some time ago. The news stunned him and he went upstairs to weep. It later emerged that Jack had died in France, alone, in poverty.After the recounting of this episode, we spent some time in silence, Denis’s eyes bright blue disks, much fierier than the mottled red of his cheeks. “Death was much harder to talk about, back then,” he said. “They had an awful lot to learn about children’s emotional needs.”“But what about your daughters’ emotional needs?” The question burst out of me, my heart thumping hard. He nodded and tried to speak, but wept instead, full of remorse, and in that moment I forgave him. I hugged him, crying too. I had my explanation. Having been failed as a child, Denis then failed his own children. Emotionally damaged, he inflicted that same damage on the next generation. Looking back, I see the theme of abandonment had played out in my own life. Most obviously, it had led me to working on an oral history project with children in care. Much later, I wrote a novel about a boy whose mother has disappeared.He lived for another year. He made a kind of miracle recovery and Marjorie took him home, and cared for him there. I got his memoir printed and sent a copy to him in the post. I heard that on the morning of his death, he watched England win the Ashes and, ecstatic, leapt out of his wheelchair. “I’m getting better and better, and younger and younger!” he cried. “I can walk! I can skip!”He died mid-skip. When I think of that moment, I see the vital schoolboy I finally got to know so well during those six weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f69b479e10e751c7aa4ce705604a85d51e90c600/115_1295_5662_3396/master/5662.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d43f9b63d28200b14ac6b8e4ed81bd48","title":"one to watch mellah middle england ep","story":"The south London carpenter turned guitarist tackles big topics in his intense indie music – and he means every single wordLiam Ramsden is Mellah, an outrageously talented south Londoner who plays several instruments, writes his own songs then directs videos for each of them.

Last year’s debut EP, Liminality, included songs about his dad’s death, depression, mindless war and selfish hedonism, while new EP Middle England takes a tour through suburbia, social media and psychosis. At a time when our best bands retreat into roleplay or cynicism, there’s something deeply affecting about a writer unafraid to provoke genuine emotion (or “feelies”, as Ramsden would have it) regarding real, rather than imaginary, things.Throughout both EPs, the only two constants are Ramsden’s vulnerable, querulous yet weirdly authoritative vocals and his liquid guitar playing.

The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Daby was a “great campaigner” and he looked forward to working with her. The selection followed Heidi Alexander’s decision to stand down from parliament after being confirmed as London’s deputy mayor for transport.Daby, who has been a councillor in the area since 2010, is also director of the Whitefoot and Downham Community Food + Project, which tackles food poverty, and previously worked in social care. She said: “This is my home and I know the issues that matter to people because they are the same issues that matter to me. “We want a good hospital, we want decent affordable housing, we want a good education and fair opportunities for all our kids. We want a transport system that is fit for purpose and we want to live in a safe, welcoming borough where everyone can feel at home. Lewisham East is a seat in south-east London, where areas of affluence sit alongside pockets of social deprivation. The urban centres of Catford, Blackheath, Lee and Grove Park fall within the constituency. It has been held by Labour since 1992 when Bridget Prentice was elected. In the last local elections the wards inside the leafy constituency returned 21 Labour councillors. Membership to the Labour party has shot up in Lewisham from 1,200 after the 2015 general election to just under 1,700.\u0026nbsp“The Lib Dem-Tory coalition tried to close our hospital. I am proud to have been part of the campaign which stopped that, and I’m proud to have campaigned against the punitive Tory cuts that have put all our services under intolerable pressure.“I’m also proud to have campaigned against this government’s appalling immigration policies, which have caused so much heartache to a generation which helped us rebuild our country.”The Lewisham East constituency in south London is a safe Labour seat, with Alexander securing an overwhelming majority of 21,123 in the 2017 general election. Corbyn said: “It’s a great pleasure to welcome Janet Daby as our candidate in Lewisham East. She is a great campaigner and has already been lobbying me about Southeastern’s appalling train services.“She will be a great advocate for the people of Lewisham and I look forward to working with her should she be elected on 14 June .” Paul Scully, Conservative party vice-chairman for London, said: “It’s disappointing to see that Labour have selected someone who for years has failed to deliver for Lewisham.

She is also the founder of Physics Without Frontiers, a Unesco-backed organisation that runs lectures, workshops and schools in war-torn nations to help kindle an interest in science and help local recovery.You work on the Atlas experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. What does that involve?I have worked on the experiment for the past 11 years and that brings me into two different areas of fundamental physics. The first is based on the top quark, the heaviest known fundamental particle in the universe. We are colliding beams of protons together and I study the top quarks that are produced in these collision. It is a great way of probing for new physics, which is really what we built our detector for. We are probing to understand complex issues that we still don’t understand.And your second interest?We are colliding protons millions of times a second at the centre of our detector and we need to know exactly the number of proton interactions that are taking place. This figure is known as luminosity. We calibrate it very precisely. We are looking at a scale of energy density of up to 13 billion billion electron volts. That is the collision energy we are getting in Atlas at the moment, conditions that correspond to a time in the early universe just a fraction of a second after the big bang. And when we build bigger colliders and hit things together even harder, we will be able to look back even further in time.It is an astonishing machine. No country has the money or even the expertise to build something this huge on its own. It is a massive advert for international collaboration. The crucial point is that I can use it whether I am in my office in Sussex University or in Palestine. I can do my analysis and research on my laptop as long as I have connections with the internet. Science is a global pursuit now.Did that influence your decision to get involved with Physics Without Frontiers?I founded the programme in 2012. I was working in Palestine – at the Birzeit University, near Ramallah on the West Bank. I gave a talk on the Large Hadron Collider and people suggested I come back. So a year later I came back with two Palestinian colleagues who were also working on the Atlas experiment and we started training students. It really grew because the quality of students is very high but they only have a master’s programme, not a PhD programme.From that beginning we started running courses. We go once or twice a year and run schools, workshops and training. Already in Palestine we have PhD students working back there and with other countries. It is all about building capacity in the country, about giving people access to science.You do not know who is going to be the next great person, the next Abdus Salam or Alan Turing. So it is our job as scientists to make sure that everyone has access to education and to be able to get involved in research no matter what country you are from. It cannot really be the luxury by the western, richer countries.How do you raise your funding?It is funded by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics, which is based in Trieste and was founded by the Nobel physics laureate Abdus Salam. It in turn is funded by three groups: Unesco, the Italian government and the International Atomic Energy Agency. We are a Unesco institute.And how do you ide your work and what other countries are you now involved with?It is about 50-50: half to Sussex on Cern stuff and the other half is with Physics Without Frontiers, which now has numerous outlets. Nepal, Afghanistan, and Palestine are my particular babies, as it were. But we also work in Latin America in Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Uruguay and we also go to Lebanon, Tunisia, Algeria, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.Do some authorities make things hard for you in places such as Palestine?Yes. It can get complicated – in Palestine in particular. With the West Bank there are fewer problems but in Gaza the political situation is disastrous. It has been under siege since 2005. They have three universities which are all doing some great physics. But the faculties there are completely isolated. They cannot leave or travel and the students we get really struggle. Sometimes they miss opportunities because they cannot get out. It is very frustrating.How does Palestine compare with other areas you are now working in?One of our more recent focuses for attention is Afghanistan, which suffers from huge issues of security. But it also has an amazing young generation there who seem to have a lot of hope that they can make the country what they know that it can be. We worked with very young faculty members in the physics department. They were extremely strong in their subject, really passionate about starting physics there and getting international collaboration at Kabul University. We held a workshop and something like 300 participants turned up. It was fantastic.It is a very secular activity you are involved in. Do some countries object to your godlessness?I always tread a little carefully in the beginning but actually in places where you might find the most conservative people are living, they ask exactly the same sorts of questions about the big bang and the origins of the universe that you would get in any other country. It is very reassuring. Even in these places you do not have to be in conflict with basic scientific ideas. They can be accepted. They also recognise that having good PhD students in physics in the country is good for the economy.At the moment we are just kicking off. We have been going for six years. It is only in the last couple of years that we have been really growing. In the end we hope that every university is connected with this programme and then that brings some more funding for physics there. Our aim is to create vibrant scientific communities across the world.• While students in Gaza may apply for, and be offered opportunities on, courses in other parts of Palestine or other countries, they encounter a great number of regulatory hurdles before they can take them up. It is common for students to offered a number of places but be unable to transfer due to the refusal of the authorities to issue the relevant permits.• Gaza students are often refused permits to attend scientific conferences in other parts of Palestine. Last July, four students were forced to participate remotely in the second Palestinian Advanced Physics School at Birzeit University because they were denied travel permits.• On a practical basis, operating a science lab in Gaza is extremely challenging. The electricity supply to the strip is erratic and can last between four and eight hours a day, making it difficult to use electronic instruments and perform experiments.• Border regulations mean that many of the materials required for science, particularly chemicals, are impossible for Gaza scientists to obtain. “The infrastructure of the laboratories is very bad because Israel considers that everything is dangerous to their security,” says Dr Rami Morjan of the Islamic University.• Equipment is also hard to fund and import. Potential overseas funding partners are nervous about buying equipment for Gaza institutions because they know from experience that it may be destroyed in a bombing raid. The result is that students often have to carry out research experiments remotely, using equipment at other institutions.• Gaza-based scientists who win grants for their research often end up losing the funding because they are unable to secure the equipment and materials needed to carry out their research because of the challenges outlined above.Source: Scientists for Palestine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/790600aa03c9dbb977fd12c8900e1713f2848bec/0_0_3072_1844/master/3072.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77d43056f1fa2192b08f4e465f10c397","title":"chris froome giro ditalia simon yates","story":"On the top of what is billed as the hardest climb in World Tour cycling, the Giro d’Italia entered its final week with the standings finely poised after a dramatic comeback from Chris Froome put the quadruple Tour de France winner back in the frame.Simon Yates successfully held the pink jersey, gradually opening a gap on the defending champion, Tom Dumoulin, but his advantage does not look decisive. Not yet.For the first time since the race left Jerusalem 15 days ago, Froome resembled the rider who has won the Tour de France four times in five years, although any result he gains in the Giro remains subject to the verdict on his adverse analytical finding for salbutamol. He made his move four kilometres from the finish, which was perched on a dizzyingly high mountain in north-east Italy, and forged ahead in his familiar style, part cyclist, part praying mantis trying to work out which leg ought to go where.Froome is never pretty to watch but he has broken plenty of hearts. Yates was not among them here he could be content, if not euphoric, after escaping the other overall contenders a kilometre after Froome had broken\u0026nbspclear.Theirs was a classic pursuit match – old Briton versus new kid on the block – with the outcome in the balance until Froome turned the final right-hand bend and faced the last 100m to the finish line up a final painfully steep slope.Behind Yates came two noted mountain men, the diminutive Domenico Pozzovivo and the grizzled Frenchman Thibaut Pinot, but if there was a surprise at the top of the monstrous 10km ascent through 100,000 baying Italian cycling fans, it was Dumoulin. His substantial Dutch frame does him no favours on a mountain this steep but he rode the perfect race for a time trial specialist. His mission was to limit his losses and he never faltered as he held Yates\u0026nbspto 31sec, where more highly rated climbers – most notably the Italian champion, Fabio Aru – ceded time.“It’s a nice gain for us,” said Yates’s team manager, Matt White, who expects his young Briton to go on the attack again on Sunday’s stage, which has a difficult finish with repeated climbs leading to the ski resort of Sappada, where a steep little ramp will favour Yates’s explosive finish. There the standings are likely to be reshuffled againYates had led the race since Mount Etna, a couple of days after the Giro’s return to Italian soil following the start in Israel. The 25-year-old from Bury had followed his electrifying attack up Etna with an assured eight days in the pink leader’s jersey, in which he had won two stages including the mountain-top finish in the Abruzzo at Gran Sasso last Sunday. This was a challenge of a different order, however.Nicknamed The Kaiser because of its proximity to the Austrian border, the climb becomes so narrow that the race organisers allowed none of the usual\u0026nbspservice and organisation vehicles to tackle the ascent for fear they might stall on a bend and block the\u0026nbsproad.Motorbikes were provided instead. There are often restrictions on the vehicles permitted to tackle the steepest climbs, but this is unprecedented. The tifosi crammed into a natural amphitheatre on the mountainside to watch the field come past at a snail’s pace, around a series of painful hairpins.For Froome, this was a welcome comeback. His Giro had stalled before it even began, with a crash as he reconnoitred the prologue time trial\u0026nbspin Jerusalem, and it had got worse with each day, with another fall – uphill, on wet roads – on stage eight before he had subsided in the final 2km at Gran Sasso.He had looked out of the picture going into the Zoncolan stage, 3min 20sec behind, but his deficit on Yates narrowed slightly and he moved within reach of the riders fighting for podium places behind the Mitchelton-Scott leader: Dumoulin, Pozzovivo and Pinot. For a man who had been written off in the last week – only seven journalists attended his rest-day press conference – it was sweet revenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/752dd111390001ec40be994c9894f6eb65f2b847/246_0_4161_2496/master/4161.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb50a0c39695ebdfbc77b164252e3212","title":"exeter don armand newcastle premiership semi final rugby union","story":"Show of skill and desire in a truly dominant display put the Chiefs into Premiership final against SaracensTwo potentially gripping semi-finals, two painfully one-sided outcomes. If Saracens were runaway winners in north London, the rumbling Exeter juggernaut proved even harder to stop beside the M5 on a gorgeous afternoon in Devon. Newcastle had made the long trip south with high hopes of troubling the champions had their outside backs known in advance how infrequently they would touch the ball they would have been sorely tempted to stay at home.The only consolation for the Falcons is that denying the Chiefs a Premiership final appearance is an increasingly tough assignment. Reaching three Premiership finals in a row may not yet compare to Leicester’s remarkable run of nine but Exeter do not look a team, or a club, who are remotely finished yet. Those who reckon Mark McCall’s Saracens will regain their title this year should not their mortgage on it.Newcastle were always dogged defensively but were comprehensively battered in virtually every department. The tackle count was nothing short of wince-inducing from a very early stage, the possession stats almost as bad. By half-time the Falcons had already been forced to make 154 tackles to the Chiefs’ nine, with a mere 10 metres of ground gained. Halting Exeter’s progress is every opposition team’s objective but, on days like this, it is easier said than done.Leinster, the European champions, are probably the only team to have outmuscled them in a big game here this season and even then Chiefs were slightly unlucky to lose at home and away. They have such depth these days that international quality forwards such as Matt Kvesic cannot even make the bench and local heroes such as Gareth Steenson and Ian Whitten are mere reserves.It provokes the question: how many more of them should be touring South Africa with England next month? Eddie Jones, as things stand, has decided he can do without Don Armand and Alec Hepburn: whatever the tactical reasons, it seems increasingly like a perverse stance. Dave Ewers and Mitch Lees add significant ballast to any pack and the day when Joe Simmonds joins his brother Sam in an England squad may not, on this evidence, be too far away.If any fly-half would have enjoyed such a luxurious armchair ride, Simmonds typifies Exeter’s continuing refusal to stand still. At the heart of their success, on top of the collective organisation, work-rate and positive intent, remains a determination to give opportunities to talented local lads who want it badly enough. The Chiefs may be high fliers these days but they will never abandon their roots.They are smartly coached, too, aware other teams are working hard on ways to stop their driven mauls and continuity game. There were, accordingly, some little variations to the usual theme, designed to keep the Falcons defence guessing. At one point the buzzing Nic White stood five metres off a scrum, collected Sam Simmonds’s pass from the base and slung it back to a charging Nowell to explore the blindside. It did not work but it showed a tell-tale willingness to do something other than the obvious.Even when Newcastle did belatedly score a try through Alex Tait late in the third quarter, the most enduring image was of Lachie Turner hurtling off the line to charge down Toby Flood’s conversion attempt. As a symbol of Exeter’s fitness and unflagging desire with the game already all but won it was hard to beat.If Tait was also guilty of the game’s biggest howler, dropping the ball in the act of touching down over the try-line with no one anywhere near him, the loudest roar was reserved for the spectacular late line-break by Thomas Waldrom, playing his final game in Devon before heading home. Had he finished it off himself, rather than sending Armand under the sticks, it would have been the perfect farewell flourish – but there will be another chance at Twickenham next Saturday.Exeter’s footballers, as last year, will be at Wembley two days later for the League Two play-off final the region’s sports fans now commute up to the smoke on an annual basis around this time of year.

But the long-term aim is still to become a bowler for all seasons and one who lives up to some as yet unfulfilled hype in Test cricket.Unless an emerald green pitch is rolled out at Lord’s when England take on Pakistan from Thursday, and makes the uncapped spin of Dom Bess as redundant as an Argos catalogue in Ikea, then the chief talking point will be whether it is Wood or Chris Woakes – who took 11 wickets in the same fixture two years ago – who gets the final spot. Though Wood is the incumbent, having replaced Woakes for the final Test of the winter in Christchurch, Root and the head coach, Trevor Bayliss, will still take a view based on the surface. Grassy, and the Warwickshire bowler could win his spot back dry with potential for reverse later on, and it is over to Durham’s fast but slightly fragile right-armer.Asked during the launch of the new England kits where his pace is currently, Wood replies: “That’s a question for the speed gun. There’s times I can bowl quickly and times I know I can but don’t like to force it because I’ll leak runs. It depends what the captain wants – if he wants me to rev it up then I’m happy to do that.“I want to be a bowler for all conditions. But I’d certainly be happy if they said Woakes, Jake Ball or whoever is more suited to a pitch – I wouldn’t have a problem. More than anything I want the team to do well. Hopefully I can bring something else when conditions aren’t like that, where it’s drier, reverses or a slower pitch.”Such skills came to the fore during Wood’s first county match of the season when, having called time early on a bench-warming spell in the Indian Premier League with Chennai Super Kings, he used similar conditions to claim a career-best six for 46 in Durham’s run-soaked draw at Derbyshire, which finished on Monday. His dismissal of Wayne Madsen, caught behind failing to evade a searing short ball from around the wicket, was his personal favourite and demonstrated why England have persisted for three years.With 28 wickets at 41 from 11 Tests, the 28-year-old accepts that while injuries are a factor, the Test-watching public are yet to see his best. “I need to get more wickets, I need to be more consistent,” says Wood. “To be honest I’ve got a lot to prove to the selectors, coaches, media, the fans because I’m a guy people probably had high hopes for and I’ve not done it consistently enough. An average of 40 is pretty average to be honest and I definitely want to lower that.“I’ve got a point to prove to myself that I am good enough to do it at that level. Am I really as good as I think I am? Am I as good as the commentators, selectors think I am? Can I live up to that? I’ve got a long way to go.”Such honesty is one of Wood’s endearing qualities, as is the drive to succeed at Test level in an era when, as a fast bowler with a back story of injuries and operations, he could easily jump on the Twenty20 train as a white-ball specialist.The reason why not? “When I was in the back garden as a kid it was never T20 or 50-over, it was Test matches. In my mind all the best players were at Test level and that’s what I wanted to strive to. These days, the 50- and 20-over stuff is a huge part of the game so I’m delighted to be part of such a good team.“But the pinnacle for me is still trying to get into that Test side and I think I have a real point to prove.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/375fad43d66220f988fc0eca062b41796dcfe68e/0_140_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92a2d8753af75aa5f0c9edae82384ad8","title":"saracens wasps premiership play off semi final match report","story":"• Saracens 57-33 Wasps• Farrell kicks 27 points to back up Saracens’ try spreeNormal service has been resumed. Saracens are back in the Premiership final. The mischievous had wondered whether they were a fading force, surrendering their Premiership title last season and suffering an unprecedented slump in the middle of this, but they have played their way back into form. Wasps were unable to cope.The visitors managed five tries, some spectacular in a predictably exhilarating festival of running rugby, but they were 20-0 down in the first quarter and 30-5 down at the start of the second half, unable to deal with a Saracens masterclass. None was more masterful than Owen Farrell, who kicked 11 from 11 for a haul of 27 points, a record for a play-off. It was good news all round for Eddie Jones.Saracens’ England contingent all looked a million dollars. On this form, England have every chance of turning round their own season too. Billy Vunipola looked punchy, but he was taken off at half-time, having received treatment on the half-hour.Wasps, meanwhile, lost Jack Willis with a nasty-looking knee injury, which may cost him his place on England’s tour of South Africa.Saracens have made it their business of late to put sides away in the second half, winning their past four matches by an average of 54-11. Their form might have been explained away by the procession of opposition they have faced with little or nothing to play for, but here was confirmation it had not been flattering.They did not wait until the second half to cut loose this time. They did not even wait till the end of the second minute. Farrell scythed between Joe Launchbury and Jake Cooper-Woolley after barely 90 seconds and found on his shoulder Alex Lozowski, who had run a brilliant supporting line, for the first try.Wasps were all over the place around the fringes, and the Saracens runners, from sufficiently various angles to confound a far meaner defence, poured through. Questions have been asked of the wisdom of Mako Vunipola’s touring with England, but he looked unstoppable with ball in hand. That said, Richard Wigglesworth could take his pick of the forwards presenting themselves at pace.Ten minutes later he chose Maro Itoje, another England player back in the swing, to crash through and Vincent Koch followed up for the try. Wasps thought they had replied almost immediately, Elliot Daly and Jimmy Gopperth combining spectacularly, but the latter’s arm was touch-in-goal before the ball was down.Saracens kept coming, but they would not score another try until the start of the second half. Three penalties did accrue from the boot of Farrell, one from a scrum, another area of dominance. It was Wasps, rather, who scored the second quarter’s only try, Christian Wade and Juan de Jongh sending Willie le Roux over.The game seemed over, though, two minutes into the second half, when Brad Barritt’s quick hands and Alex Goode’s draw-and-give put Chris Wyles over for a 30-5 lead. Surely curtains. Wasps had other ideas.Daly was unlucky to be denied a try by the TMO a couple of minutes later, but Wasps had their second when Cooper-Woolley barged through Nick Isiekwe from an attacking lineout, before Wasps hit their highest note yet. Wade took an inside pass to cut Saracens to shreds and turn the ball inside for Thomas Young to gallop 35 metres to the line. Wasps were back to within 11 with half an hour to play.It was then 10 with 20 to go. Farrell steadied Saracens with a couple of penalties, but Wasps struck again on the hour. Danny Cipriani sent Guy Thompson through a gap and the latter sent Le Roux to the tryline for his second and a 36-26 scoreline.It was as close as Wasps would get. Saracens seemed exasperated by the way the visitors were now cutting them up, but they never seemed in trouble. They duly killed the game off with two tries in the next 10 minutes, Juan Figallo from short range after Shalk Brits had cut Wasps down the left, then Sean Maitland the right, and Itoje, who galloped home from rather further out.The carnival feel continued with another try apiece, one for the electric Wade, one for Ben Spencer, but Saracens’ minds had already, no doubt, turned to Twickenham.Eddie Jones would have enjoyed watching Saracens, such was the form of several of his key players in their 57-33 play-off win over Wasps, but it seems likely he will be denied the services of one of his most promising youngsters, Jack Willis, for England’s tour to South Africa next month. The Wasps flanker was helped from the field towards the end of the first half, having hyperextended his knee. The initial prognosis is not positive.“It’s not looking great,” said Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby. “He’s in a brace and on crutches and they think it’s serious enough for him to have a scan straightaway.”Jones will also monitor closely Billy Vunipola’s status. He started the game, like his fellow England No 8 Nathan Hughes, the latter more surprisingly selected for his first Premiership start since October, but Vunipola left the field at half-time, having received treatment on the half‑hour.“He felt a little tightness in his hamstring,” said Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby. “He fought with us a bit to go back on for the second half, but it didn’t seem worth the risk, with half an eye on next weekend. He’s got a chance to be fit. He probably won’t train on Monday or Tuesday, but he played pretty well for 40 minutes for someone who hasn’t played very much.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd05ebe92424f5b10f9c795a4599e98edfef826a/164_142_3336_2002/master/3336.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77d80a65aa3fdad0eab764172bc4e18a","title":"widnes st helens super league magic weekend match report","story":"• Widnes 18-38 St Helens• Regan Grace and Ryan Morgan touch down twice for St HelensThis performance by St Helens will hardly be remembered as the most eye-catching of Justin Holbrook’s first year in charge but, on the anniversary of his arrival, it perhaps best illustrated the transformation of the club under his tenure.The opening Super League game of the Magic Weekend will hardly take up too much time on the highlights package, but for the Super League leaders it underlined the vital trait of being able to win even when they are not playing to their\u0026nbsppotential.St Helens, who consolidated their place at the top of the table with this win, were pushed commendably by a Widnes side who lost their full-back, Rhys Hanbury, inside the opening five minutes to\u0026nbspinjury.At half-time the Vikings were four points adrift of a St\u0026nbspHelens side who had laboured through stages of the opening 40 minutes at St James’ Park – albeit inspired by another superb inidual performance from Ben Barba in and amongst an error‑strewn display.This was an afternoon that emphasised how there is much more to this side than the irrepressible Australian. Barba was ably assisted by the evergreen James Roby and the magnificent young half-back Danny Richardson, who will surely earn an England call sooner rather than later.For Widnes, though, that they ran the league leaders so close in spells before fading away in the final half‑hour – when the Saints scored three tries without reply to secure victory – is a reflection of their campaign. Frequently, they have taken some of the better sides close but their performances against the lesser teams have left them in a precarious\u0026nbspposition.They took the lead here courtesy of Matt Whitley’s try before Saints quickly took control, with tries from Richardson, Mark Percival and Regan Grace – coupled with a superb try-saving tackle from Barba moments earlier.At that stage, leading 18-6, it threatened to be a somewhat ugly afternoon for Widnes but they battled valiantly.They reduced the deficit when the Papua New Guinea international prop Wellington Albert scored from close-range, and while Barba’s 16th try of the season followed soon after, a wonderful team move on the stroke of half-time led to Jimmy Keinhorst narrowing the Saints’ lead to four\u0026nbsppoints.However, the second half was markedly different for the Vikings. Though the Saints continued to stutter and stumble in patches, they were ultimately too good for their opponents. A Richardson penalty settled their nerves, before a sublime passage of play led to Ryan Morgan touching\u0026nbspdown.Morgan followed that with another try – albeit somewhat contentiously, as he appeared to drop the ball in the act of scoring – before Grace finished the afternoon’s scoring with a breakaway try to compound Widnes’s misery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fabeeb4a76967aad8757b8bcbb7fb2fee423c044/0_203_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f3b2900d30c54bd6ff407eebcfa2397","title":"giro ditalia 2018 stage 14  monte zoncolan simon yates live","story":"Chris Froome attacked on the final climb at Monte Zoncolan to earn a welcome stage win, while Simon Yates came second and extended his overall leadChris Froome, kicked out of the Giro in 2010 for hitching a ride on a police motorbike, has enjoyed his best ever ride in this race. Sounds like Team Sky have not written this off just yet. Pinot lost 42 seconds, which could have been worse, considering he was never one of the main players as that final climb took shape. Great ride from Domenico Pozzovivo, who fought back well. Froome celebrated that like it was one of his greatest triumphs. There is a week to go, and he is not completely out of this, though winning the Giro from here *would* be his greatest moment. Yates looks insanely comfortable: the face of a man in a deckchair, deliberating over a second cup of Earl Grey. Absolutely ridiculous.And Yates showed his mettle and form by almost taking the stage. He gets six probably vital seconds of bonus for finishing second in the stage. Dumoulins, though, is still very much in this, with a trademark gritty ride. He only lost 31 seconds on the leader. That’s been one hell of a race, living up to its billing. Froome, despite all his woes, has written himself into history with that win on one of the toughest climbs in cycling. Fabio Aru is over the line, but lost 2’ 26”. That’s the host’s best chance gone.. Pinot goes over the line and looks to have lost over a minute. Now for the clock, Dumoulin finishes fifth and will only lose 30 seconds on Yates. Froome leading into the last 200m. Yates cannot get there. Froome takes one of those vicious hairpins. The rain coming down with Yates on his tail. Yates now closing on Froome. This could be a photo finish....Dumoulin under the “one km to go” sign. He’s had a decent day, and might be happy that Yates has not made up too much time. Has Froome bonked? He’s into the first of three tunnels. The tunnel approaches for Froome, with one kilometre to go. But Yates is gaining. Froome is still out in front, and has shown he has fight left in him, a consolation when his dream of adding the Giro to Le Tour and the Vuelta is looking doomed.As it stands, Yates is going to take 25 seconds out of his chasers. Under 2.5km to go. Dumoulin and Pinot, Yates’ challengers are grouped together. Yates is gaining...tremendous ride from him. Froome threw the kitchen sink at it, but does he have anything left in the tank?Now Yates has a go, and he has blown Lopez and Pozzovivo away. Froome looks to be slowing but the gap is still at 11 seconds. Meanwhile, Yates has got 20 seconds on Dumoulin, which he would have targeted at the start of the day. The time trial on Tuesday has to be borne in mind. Froome is 11 seconds clear on Yates, who nevertheless looks cool. Froome needs to take minutes, not seconds off him. He kicks again, bathed in sweat. Lopez and Pozzovivo look to be pacing Yates up the hill. Froome is almost over the worst of the hill. Yates won’t want him to get too far clear but, barring disaster, the pink jersey will be his. And Froome is clear! The road is open for him to win this. Behind him, Pozzovivo and Yates, who can content himself that Dumoulin is falling back. Froome attacks! He’s got three minutes to make up. And Yates has dropped back.Chris Froome takes evasive action to shove a fan dressed as a dinosaur to the side of the road. It’s a cramped road, and people playing the fool are not welcome. We are under 5km now. Yates is strong, and sitting off Froome’s shoulder. Yates looked back to see where Dumoulin was, only to see his rival is still hanging on. The Sky Train is in session now. A familiar sight, maybe, but not one that has been in evidence in Italy this year. Poels and Froome are strong but Yates is in their slipstream. Michael Woods’ attempt for glory looks to have failed. The final, deadly five kilometres are approaching. Most of the favourites are in touch, with Pinot accompanied by a teammate. Aru’s chance has gone, it seems. Woods has a little daylight. Froome now looking in better nick and has moved up a bit. Yates is looking comfortable. And Aru has been dropped. Dumoulin struggling? Poels is still setting the pace. Woods has not been allowed to get away. Fabio Aru is out of the saddle as the race slips away from him. Michael Woods, the Canadian with EF Education First–Drapac, with an attack off the front. He’s in a pink jersey, though not the important one. Dumoulin is in deep in the pack, riding defensively as expected. Froome is ahead of him, while Yates is sat in an OK position. Conti is caught by Anton at the front, but the peloton is now within 15 seconds. Wout Poels has been attempting to lead the group but Froome doesn’t look in the form to take advantage of his teammates’ work.The road is flanked by heavy woodland meaning that the various bends are a real problem to negotiate and to catch sight of rivals. Rohan Dennis, previously in seventh, has been dropped. He has lost weight to get better at climbing, but it’s been too much. This road is narrowing, and this is the easy part. Gruelling stuff and far worse to come. Conti is hanging on grimly at the front. But he is now below 30 seconds ahead. We are under 9km already, and Simon Yates is looking good. Chris Froome way down the group. He looks a bit ragged, but that is no guide, considering the style that has brought him such success.Here’s where it begins. The peloton has caught up with all but the first two of the former breakaway. Igor Anton, a former winner of this stage, has kicked for victory early. Very early. The leading pair are heading through the gates.There are just 11km to go, but the real story will be written over the next hour or so. Talk of the start of the hill being known as the “gates to Hell”. From the top of the mountain, Ray tells me that the “cowbells are ringing here now”. The final descent is in place, just as calm and collected as the previous climb. The breakaway down to two men, Conte and Barbin. Their glory is done for now, though at least they will reach the Zoncolan first. Conti takes the points at the penultimate peak. Now for the Zoncolan..... Yates has three men alongside him in the dwindling peleton, including the experience of Roman Kreuziger. The leading group, their lead down to 1’10” are trying to gain those points. Valerio Conti is going for them, but this looks a last hurrah for the escapees. Here’s where the wildcat attacks start. There are mountain classification points to fight for. Yates leads that as well, and Chaves, out the back, has been looking after the jersey for him, won’t be collecting any points. A TV shot of the Monte Zoncolan shows the tifosi are dressed in sensible kagouls and with umbrellas at the ready. That breakaway group is down to 2’00” and dropping. Sunweb are pushing things along with Tom Dumoulin looking quite calm under his shades. Mitchelton-Scott have the front of the group, with Yates also staying cool. Live Fitba alert here. Barry Glendenning is beavering away on this one. Ok, we are at the bottom of the valley now. The Maglia Rosa group is small. This is where the fun begins. Just under 30km to go and it gets tougher all the way. Meanwhile, from the Monte Zoncolan itself, Ray Murphy, awaiting that final climb, has been in touch via Twitter (My DMs are open). Pissed rain earlier . Nice and sunny now .. crowds massive all the way up .. people camped everywhere overnight .. bbq making me hungry .. wonderful atmosphere.. great anticipation. Tremendous colour.If that descent has been a little safety first,  reader Dr Joe Street has emailed in a classic of the genre, Big Fabio Cancellara showing us how it’s done.

He’s up against Nicolás Maduro, the deeply unpopular and increasingly authoritarian president who is seeking another six-year term despite leading this oil-rich nation into its worst economic crisis in decades. Yet Falcón is the underdog.He’s resigned to the usual dirty tricks from the ruling Socialist Party, including the use of state food hand-outs to lure hungry people into voting for Maduro. But what most infuriates him is friendly fire: Venezuela’s largest opposition parties are denouncing Falcón as a stooge for participating in an election they say will be a sham – and which they have vowed to boycott.“This makes it a lot more complicated,” Falcón admits. “But we are going to take risks and follow the democratic path. Now is not the time for politicians to go into hiding.”Falcón has been buoyed by polls that show him either ahead or within striking distance of Maduro. He also points to research showing that even on an unfair electoral playing field, it’s almost always better to participate than to stand down. A 2009 study by the Brookings Institution of more than 100 electoral boycotts – from Afghanistan to Iraq to Peru – found that their goal of rendering elections illegitimate in the eyes of the world was rarely achieved. Instead, they left the boycotting parties in an even weaker state.Javier Corrales, a Venezuela expert at Amherst College, says that Sunday’s election presents an extremely rare opportunity for voters to remove an autocrat through peaceful means. Surrendering to Maduro, he says, “is the biggest mistake I’ve seen the opposition make in a decade.”The leaders of the largest of the 20-some parties that make up the opposition coalition claim that electoral conditions are so grossly weighted in Maduro’s favor that voting on Sunday would be pointless.Most electoral officials are Maduro loyalists who, in past elections, have turned a blind eye to vote tampering and the last-minute relocation of polling places in opposition strongholds. The government controls most TV and radio stations which transmit a constant stream of of pro-Maduro propaganda. It is also fomenting the notion that the ballot is not secret and that people who vote for the opposition will lose government jobs, public housing, and vital food handouts.Under the late Hugo Chávez, who ushered in Venezuela’s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.\u0026nbspThis concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts. After Chávez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.\u0026nbspIt also means that the government can’t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.\u0026nbspMaduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions – through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.“It matters little whether this threat is real or perceived. Most people can’t afford to risk their paltry food rations to in order find out,” wrote the Caracas political blogger Emiliana Duarte. Maduro’s re-election pitch “pretty much comes down to ‘vote for me if you want food, starve if you want to make a point’”, she said.At a campaign rally in the western city of Barquisimeto, Maduro put it this way: “The Fatherland protects you and gives you everything. And you must give the Fatherland political power.”But just to make sure, the government has banned the two most popular opposition politicians – Leopoldo López who is under house arrest for inciting violence and Henrique Capriles who faces trumped-up corruption charges – from running. Those allowed on the ballot are two lesser-known figures: Falcón and televangelist Javier Bertucci, who is attracting big crowds by turning his campaign events into makeshift soup kitchens.Carlos González, an anti-government activist who heads a Venezuelan business association, says the name on the ballot doesn’t matter: “Jesus Christ could be the candidate and Maduro would still prevail because the system is set up for him to win,” he says. The opposition has taken this argument overseas, convincing the United States, the European Union and several Latin American countries to denounce the balloting as a sham.“Yes, Venezuelans want to vote. But we don’t want to legitimize the Maduro regime and the misery that he has brought to the country,” said Negal Morales, an opposition lawmaker. “To vote would be to take part in a farce.”Some critics contend that the boycott came about after the opposition was outmaneuvered by government negotiators. In discussions over electoral conditions, the opposition drew a line in the sand, demanding a neutral electoral tribunal, a postponement of the balloting until October, and the presence of international observers. After months of talks, the government conceded almost nothing. According to one observer, that left the opposition feeling obliged to save face by making good on its threat to sit out the election.“Maduro wants people to abstain,” Francisco Rodríguez, Falcón’s chief policy advisor, said. “He wants nobody to come out to vote because that’s the only election he can win. And the opposition fell into that trap.”Looking back on that outcome, Genaro Arriagada, the national director of Chile’s “no” campaign, once declared: “Even in a dictatorship, the worst mistake is to not participate.”With that in mind, Falcón has been barnstorming the country to convince people to that their votes matter. A former governor of the western state of Lara, Falcón was once a vocal supporter of the Bolivarian revolution ushered in by the late Hugo Chávez in 1999. But Falcón broke with Chávez in 2008 and has become a fierce critic of Maduro. His blunt campaign slogan is ¡Se va! – Spanish for “He’s leaving”.Speaking to a crowd in a working-class barrio in the industrial city of Valencia, Falcón called Maduro “the president of hunger and misery”. He pointed out that the average monthly salary is no longer enough to buy a carton of eggs and outlined his plan to scrap the bolívar, Venezuela’s badly devalued currency, and replace it with the US dollar.Maduro has said that he is a victim of “economic warfare” waged from Washington his critics blame the cratering economy on mismanagement. Meanwhile a steady stream of multinationals have withdrawn from Venezuela saying that currency controls and shortages make it impossible to do business in the country. This week, the breakfast cereal maker Kellogg’s announced that it was pulling out because of the “economic and social deterioration in the country.”In the crowd at Valencia, one newfound Falcón supporter, Maricarmen Vidal, said she used to work as a cleaning woman in the house of a middle-class family in Valencia. But to escape the economic meltdown, the family moved abroad and she was thrown out of work. Now, she eeks out a living selling tiny bags of sugar and coffee on a Valencia street corner. Vidal says about the only thing she knows about Falcón is that he’s not Maduro – “but that’s enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3269547a7c15387881c41f5ddc23fd209ec68957/69_0_2063_1238/master/2063.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e3c59c0618af81f9e784f5627a3137","title":"china says air force lands bombers on south china sea islands","story":"Exercise described by air force as preparation for ‘the battle’ for the disputed waters China’s air force has landed bombers on islands and reefs in the South China Sea as part of a training exercise in the disputed region, it said in a statement.Several bombers of various types – including the long-range, nuclear strike-capable H-6K – carried out landing and take off drills at an unidentified island airfield after carrying out simulated strike training on targets at sea, the Chinese airforce said.“A ision of the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) recently organised multiple bombers such as the H-6K to conduct take-off and landing training on islands and reefs in the South China Sea in order to improve our ability to ‘reach all territory, conduct strikes at any time and strike in all directions’,” it said.The statement said the pilot of the H-6K bomber conducted assault training on a designated sea target and then carried out take-offs and landings at an airport in the area, describing the exercise as preparation for “the west Pacific and the battle for the South China Sea”. The notice, published on the PLAAF’s Weibo microblogging account, did not provide the precise location of the exercise. The US has dispatched warships to disputed areas of the South China Sea in a bid to challenge China’s extensive sovereignty claims in the territory, which is also subject to claims by Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia. The waters are vital global shipping routes and contain what are believed to be significant oil and natural gas deposits.“The United States remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Pentagon spokesman Lt Col Christopher Logan said. “We have seen these same reports and China’s continued militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilise the region.” Wang Mingliang, a defence expert cited in the Chinese statement, said the takeoff and landing exercises will help the air force “strengthen its combat capability to deal with maritime security threats”.The move comes weeks after US network CNBC reported that China had installed anti-ship and air-to-air defences on outposts in the Spratly Islands that are also claimed by Vietnam and the Philippines, citing sources close to US intelligence.Washington warned Beijing would face unspecified “consequences” over its militarisation of the South China Sea, and said it had raised the issue with China.In an analysis published on its website, CSIS said the location of the runway was believed to be Woody Island, China’s largest base in the Paracel Islands, which is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.China has engaged in years of land-reclamation efforts on reefs it controls in the region and built both civilian and military facilities in the contested area.Chinese military facilities include air bases, radar and communications systems, naval facilities and defensive weaponry including landing strips able to accommodate military planes.Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/358ae420467fd99eafb5fd11a5eb8b72478347cf/0_605_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d03c8f056baf30df3af6e539da08478","title":"evangelicals israel usa end times","story":"For many on the Christian right, the state of Israel has been seen as a key to fulfilling prophesy. A new generation has other ideasThis week, the Trump administration completed its move of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.At the opening ceremony, two of the American speakers were evangelical superstars: Pastor Robert Jeffress, the author of several doomsday books about Israel, and John Hagee, who interpreted recent lunar eclipses as evidence that the end times were nigh. The Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro, meanwhile, declared that Trump had “fulfilled biblical prophecy”.The ceremony coincided with massive protests, in which 60 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces.Thousands of miles away, in her home outside Colorado Springs, Kimberly Troup sat in a cluttered basement office. She is an evangelical Christian who takes to heart the Bible verse in which God speaks of the Jewish nation: “I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse.”Accordingly, she has devoted 22 years to Israel. She is now the US director of Christian Friends of Israeli Communities, an advocacy group with a Zionist ideology. Two other CFIC employees work with her. This week, they have been very busy. Ever since she was a child, in Kentucky, Troup has been immersed in Israel. Her father saw the creation of the state in 1948 and the six-day war of 1967 as evidence of biblical prophecy surrounding the end of the world. Troup believes in such prophecies, though she does not pretend to know when they will occur. She sees it as her Christian duty to care for Israel, to defend it against “Arabs” who are “not interested in peace”.As she described her position an associate, previously silent, spoke up, quoting the book of Isaiah: “You who call on the Lord, give yourselves no rest, and give him no rest till he establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.” Christians around the world have always had an intense interest in the Holy Land. It has often been believed that the restoration of the Jews in Palestine will bring about a holy war between good and evil (as prophesied in the Book of Revelation), after which God will set up a holy kingdom on Earth. In the 1970s, Troup’s father was one of millions who purchased a book called The Late Great Planet Earth, which interpreted events in Israel as evidence that the great war of Armageddon would happen by the late 1980s. The non-fiction bestseller of the decade, it was followed by the wildly popular end times conspiracy tome The New World Order, by the televangelist Pat Robertson, and then the Left Behind novels and films, which concerned violent clashes in Israel that would bring about biblical prophecy. To outsiders, these pieces of doomsday pop culture seem like far-fetched lunacy. For millions of Christians, they are a roadmap to the end of the world.The recent move of the US embassy has solidified the notion – not shared by the Palestinian people – that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel, an essential piece of the end times puzzle. In a recent poll of evangelicals from LifeWay, more than half of respondents said end times prophecy was the reason they supported Israel. However, even in Colorado Springs, which in the heyday of the George W Bush administration was unofficially known as the “Evangelical Vatican”, such interpretations of the move are not universal.“We’ve been through all this before,” said Bruce McCluggage, a former evangelical who now identifies as a “follower of Christ”. Throughout his youth, in the 1970s and 80s, McCluggage was part of the Christian movement that interpreted the signs of Israel as evidence of the last days. But for McCluggage, after a slow-burn of things not coming to pass, that conviction slowly faded.“It was a classic tool used to witness to people,” he recalled. “We’d ask: ‘If Jesus returned today, would you go to Heaven?’ It was kind of a threat … and we thought, with Israel coming together, we could hasten the return of Jesus.” With long blond hair and a stout little chin beard, McCluggage still looks like a member of the California Jesus People, a movement of post-hippie Christians who were obsessed with end times prophecy. (The term “left behind” comes from a popular song of the era, I Wish We’d All Been Ready, by Larry Norman, the godfather of Christian rock.) He still attends church, prays and reads his Bible, but has slowly distanced himself from the Christian right.Today, he sits in the Wild Goose Meeting House in downtown Colorado Springs, a venue known for its “post-evangelical” or “progressive evangelical” contingent. It looks like any other hip modern coffeehouse, serving expensive pour-over coffee and craft beers to an indie rock soundtrack. Books with titles like Christianity After Religion and The Rebirthing of God line the shelves events like What Would Jesus Brew? – beer-centric Bible study – regularly take place.The hallmarks of the old Christian rightwing culture are still present: it’s very white, middle-upper class, and peppered with soldiers in fatigues. The town has five military installations. But the shop is representative of a shifting attitude toward Christianity in downtown Colorado Springs – one that doesn’t have much interest in the apocalyptic rhetoric surrounding Israel.“There are plenty of young millennials downtown that would call themselves evangelical, even conservative, but are a very different breed from their parents,” said Russ Ware, co-owner of the Wild Goose, who grew up evangelical but no longer identifies that way. “They’re mostly not Trump supporters they have a spectrum of views on LGBT issues, and they’re not on board with the end times theology … There is definitely a kind of end times fatigue with this generation.”This “post-evangelical” generation was raised on a steady diet of low-budget movies and pulp novels that injected a potent fear of the coming Rapture, a dynamic most eloquently described by the late Billy Graham. “I pick up the Bible in one hand,” he said, “and I pick up the newspaper in the other. And I read almost the same words in the newspaper as I read in the Bible. It’s being fulfilled every day round about us.”In the 1990s, Christopher Stroop was one such evangelical. He has now abandoned his faith and leads a social media campaign seeking to galvanize “exvangelicals” with hashtags like #emptythepews and #raptureanxiety. He said he had “definitely seen a lot of ex-evangelicals talking about being triggered by the Jerusalem news”.It’s not only post-evangelicals who are dubious about the end times scenario. Kimberly Troup believes Israel will be the center of Armageddon, but she doesn’t think it’s all happening now. The author of her father’s favourite book released follow-ups that predicted ever-later dates for the Earth’s demise. She is dubious about anyone who claims to know when the world will end.“The great fear was moving the embassy to Jerusalem would be the start of World War Three and Armageddon,” she said. “There’s a little rumbling, but nothing new. We’ve had this for 600 years. It’s gonna be business as usual … “It feels worse than it is because you only hear about the bad stuff on the media.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c14350da8d726c795bcd8d4ed933775707153f/0_1969_3983_2390/master/3983.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc2c94653984f9495b13d44d2b475244","title":"exposed how to disappear from the internet","story":"Worried about what’s out there about you? You’re not alone. But is it even possible to become a digital ghost?Early one morning last year, before the birds were up, Tio Bucard, his wife and children skittered down the path from their home in a tiny French village towards a black SUV, its engine running. As Bucard drove to the local airport, he checked his rear-view mirror every few moments to see that he was still being followed by Frank Ahearn, a 54-year-old American with a peppery beard and wraparound sunglasses. Bucard (not his real name) had met Ahearn for the first time only the day before, in the lobby of a Monaco hotel close to Bucard’s office. Now he had entrusted his family’s safety to this former drug addict from the Bronx. Bucard pulled into the airport’s long-term car park. Then he and the family transferred into Ahearn’s hired SUV. As they pulled on to the motorway, Ahearn joked whether, while the family was in hiding, he could look after Bucard’s £5,000 watch, a Bentley Flying B No 3.The watch was a reminder of more plentiful times. Bucard, who raised capital for a private equity firm, had recently found himself on the wrong end of a bad deal. Problems gathered and the firm began to default on payments. One of the slighted investors had, as Bucard puts it, “a shady past” and angry phone calls soon blackened into threats of physical violence. Fearing for his and his family’s safety, Bucard typed the phrase “how to disappear” into Google. Halfway down the first page of results, he saw Ahearn’s name. A former New York skip tracer – a private investigator who finds people who have “skipped” town – turned professional “disappearer”, Ahearn offers a range of freelance services, everything from helping to restore your privacy on the internet to driving your family across Europe and into a new life.“My idea was to go away for three to four months,” Bucard tells me. “Just until I could raise the funds to pay back my investors.” Not wanting to cause alarm, Bucard told his children they were taking an extended vacation. The day before they fled, Ahearn rented an Airbnb in a far-flung city in his name. When the family arrived at the safe house, Ahearn bought new mobile phones and laptops, then schooled the family on the rules of their new life: do use untraceable text-messaging services don’t use public email servers do pay in cash don’t use Facebook. After a few days, Ahearn left the Bucards in their temporary accommodation and returned to his home in Madrid, where he lives with his girlfriend. In his wallet, he carried Bucard’s credit card.When he landed in Spain, Ahearn tried to imagine what a man of Bucard’s wealth might indulge in while on holiday. Then he began a riot of spending: fine clothes, meals out, a king’s ransom of trinkets. “I had a blast with his plastic,” he says. “And that, my friend, is how to leave a trail of super-cool disinformation.”Money, violence, indiscretion: the motivation for any person who wants to disappear, either physically or digitally, usually wends back to one of these. Whatever the reason and whatever the scale of the ambition – from starting a new life in a foreign country to scrubbing one’s name and address from the phonebook – it has never been harder to vanish. In a world where almost any action outside your garden shed leaves some kind of digital footprint, there is no clear path back to the realm of the unknown.In recent months, the scale of the erosion of our anonymity has become dauntingly clear. In humming, ice-cooled server farms, the monoliths of Silicon Valley gather fat troves of personal information. This much we have known for years – as early as 2010, an investigation found that Facebook apps were routinely collecting information for internet-tracking companies without our consent – even from private accounts. But the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal brought new clarity. Those who downloaded their personal data files found that Facebook and its associated apps had been tracking phone calls, reading messages and plundering phonebooks.This gleeful, grasping attitude to our data is in the social network’s DNA. This year it was revealed that in 2004, while Facebook was still a university campus website on which male students could rate the attractiveness of female students, its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, sent an instant message to a friend in which he boasted that he had collected more than 4,000 emails, pictures and addresses of people who had signed up to the service.“What?” Zuckerberg’s friend exclaimed. “How’d you manage that one?”“People just submitted it,” Zuckerberg wrote. “I don’t know why. They ‘trust me’.”“Dumb fucks,” he added, after a pause.Facebook is not the only harvester of personal information. If Google is the engine that drives the internet, personal information is the oil that makes it purr. Via its Maps app, it knows where you’ve been, how you got there (foot, car, bus, train), how long you stayed and whether or not it was your first visit. The company stores your search history across every device on which you’re logged in, while algorithms reportedly scour your emails for signs that you might be pregnant, engaged or unwell. Google Lens, announced earlier this month, is a visual search engine that provides information about the things you’re looking at through your phone’s camera. Google likely knows your age, gender, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, every YouTube video you’ve watched, every image you’ve searched for, whether or not you’re depressed and, possibly, even why you’re depressed before you do – and it’s far from the only omniscient god in the digital pantheon. What began as a hopeful, democratic mission to make the internet free for all in the 1990s has, when fed through the late capitalist mincer, resulted in a digital economy that runs on microtransactions of identity. This information, if held by a government, would inspire widespread civil liberty marches.For most of us, the quality and convenience of what we receive in exchange for our secrets is enough that we willingly surrender. But now an increasing number of people are more closely counting the cost – to the point of trying to reclaim our right to be unknown. It’s become a challenge: the woman fleeing an abusive relationship, the elderly victim of identity theft, the stalked celebrity, the school leaver who’s sabotaged their job search with old, embarrassing YouTube videos, already knows just how difficult that can be.When Ahearn finished rehab, aged 17, he had quit pills but was left newly directionless. He took a stopgap job in a New York shoe store. Then, when it closed down, he responded to an advertisement for a private investigator. The job was glamour-less, but Ahearn found it intoxicating nonetheless. He was hired to pose as a stockroom worker for high-end New York stores and catch co-workers stealing the merchandise. He caught 15 employees stealing from one department store, and later busted a 30-man criminal ring at an electronics and furniture warehouse. “Manipulation,” he says. “It’s the first thing I was ever really good at.”Carry out a self-styled “before” audit to see what’s out there. Search for yourself with all name variations, email addresses and residential addresses. You could be shocked by what you find.\u0026nbspAll active accounts must be deleted – not deactivated – if you want to use the internet untraceably. Facebook, Amazon, eBay, Netflix, Tinder: they all have to go. It can be difficult to remember every site you have signed up for, so look in your email inbox for newsletters. Unsubscribe and ask to be removed from their data list the new GDPR update on 25 May 2018 means that sites are legally obliged to do this on request.It’s highly likely that personal data such as home address, email and even your date of birth is being publicly shared online by so-called data broker websites, such as 192. Ask for this information to be removed directly from the site, and they should comply.If you’ve posted on web forums, you can ask the webmasters to remove your posting. If they prove unresponsive, and data brokers or social media companies fail to remove your information on request, then exercise the “right to be forgotten” by a direct request to Google (search for legal removal request).Unfortunately, once removed does not mean for ever removed on the internet. You should actively audit yourself every six months and some of the steps may have to be repeated. And if you can’t quite make all the necessary sacrifices, consider setting up a false email address with inaccurate data, amending personal details such as age, sex, name and location.After a while, the private detective agency allowed Ahearn to work in the office. There he sat next to a skip tracer. “Skip-tracing is the art of finding people,” he explains. “There are two types of skip tracer: passive ones, who use databases and directories to find people and aggressive ones, who carry out social engineering to find their prey.” Ahearn would listen as his colleague extracted information about someone by calling utility companies and posing as the target in order to gain access to their phone records and bank details until, finally, he zoned in on a likely hideout address. Ahearn convinced his boss to give him a go. “I was like wildfire,” he recalls. “A natural.”In 1984, Ahearn left the detective agency and set up as a freelance skip tracer. For a while, business boomed. He would occasionally take short breaks (“Sometimes being so good at something so devious plays on the head”), but then crisis dawned when the laws in America changed, making many of the skip tracers’ techniques illegal. “Life became more difficult,” he recalls. Ahearn moved to Europe, where the laws were less stringent, and then, in the late 1990s, the pendulum swung back. The omnipresence of the mobile phone made it far easier to track iniduals, and the creeping ubiquity of social media ushered in a new golden era for the investigator. “I can find you through your mother’s Facebook, a blog you wrote three years ago, an old LinkedIn account,” Ahearn says.In 2001, he placed an advertisement on a website that provided advice about offshore living. When the website’s owner pointed out that Ahearn’s work finding people might concern its users, who, in many cases, prized anonymity, Ahearn suggested that he write a blogpost on how to disappear instead. “It was a really cheesy article, but it just blew up,” Ahearn recalls. “People from all over the world started contacting me.” Once he had weeded out those iniduals looking for an aider and abetter (“If you’re facing law enforcement, I cannot help you I also stay away from sexual issues”), Ahearn took on his first client: a woman who wanted to escape from her violent partner. “She didn’t want a new identity, just to move away and be sure that the husband couldn’t find her,” he says.In the past 15 years, the techniques Ahearn uses to ghost a client have grown in scope and sophistication. But unlike reputation management companies, which typically try to drive harmful or revealing information down search engine results, he favours the use of misinformation – and not just via misdirecting credit card transactions in a foreign city. “You can’t delete information,” he says. “It’s not going away. It’s a case of manipulating what is already out there.”If Ahearn is the special forces of the vanishment industry, brought in for the most extreme jobs, a sparse, open-plan office on the outskirts of Liverpool is home to the foot soldiers of this burgeoning industry. Here, at Reputation Defender, a team of 30 or so young men and women scour the internet for personal information – phone numbers, dates of birth, addresses, electoral records – that their clients want removed from the internet.Managing director Tony McChrystal began working in online privacy and reputation management before there was a name for the industry. In 2008, when he joined the company, then known as Reputation 247, as one of its first employees, it had just five clients. “We were living hand to mouth, you know, never sure whether we were going to be able to open the doors the following month,” he says. Today, the company is one of the largest in its field McChrystal claims that the UK office receives 70 inquiries a day, mostly from iniduals who want to become unknown on the internet. To date, the company has served more than a million clients worldwide, and last month it was bought by the Washington-based Stagwell Group for an undisclosed sum.In the early years, McChrystal’s clients were typically celebrities, footballers and CEOs: people who wanted specific pieces of professionally damaging information about them – an affair, a failed business deal – pushed down the search engine rankings. In recent years, however, he says that the company mainly works with the kind of “regular” people who might pay for their credit file report every month, and who want a similar reputation or privacy report. For around £600 a year, the company will give you a list of what personal or sensitive information is publicly available. “A lot of the time, they’re scared of identity theft, fraud or even – if their current address is out there – scared of their own personal safety,” McChrystal says. It is surprisingly easy for a criminal to use social media to plan a burglary. “One of our clients’ daughter was on holiday in France recently at the family villa, and she posted geo-tagged pictures on Instagram of the villa alongside pictures of her and her friends wearing expensive jewellery and watches,” McChrystal explains. Within 24 hours of posting, there was a home invasion at the villa and half a million dollars’ worth of jewellery was stolen. “After that, we had to go in and talk about how to manage their privacy settings on their Instagram and Facebook.”Like Ahearn, McChrystal and his team screen the motivations of potential clients. “We probably get two paedophiles call up every day,” he admits. This kind of inidual, McChrystal says, will typically claim they are the victim of mistaken identity: someone who shares their name has been accused of something awful. “That kind of thing actually doesn’t happen very often, so we tell them we will have to carry out a police check, and that’s when the conversation breaks down.” Team members refer to a “Who we serve” document, drawn up by the company’s lawyers, which forbids working with criminals who have been convicted of “anything above a misdemeanour”, as well as fraudsters and those who have been accused of sexual misconduct. “It’s not even up for debate. If you were found guilty of physical abuse, that’s relevant information to me. It shouldn’t be forgotten, you know?”Google agrees. In 2014, the European court of justice ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. In the past four years, the company has received more than 600,000 requests (many of which were submitted by the team at Reputation Defender on behalf of its clients) to delist nearly 2.4m results from the search engine. In many cases, Google has successfully argued that the information is in the public interest and that the petitioner does not have the right to be forgotten.In the past two years, however, McChrystal, who deleted his own Facebook account some time ago, has seen a marked increase in approaches from iniduals who are not in danger or want a piece of damaging information covered up, but who simply want to reclaim their anonymity.Emma Jones approached the team last year after one of her closest friends was the victim of identity theft. When Jones Googled herself, she found her name and address posted to various directory sites. “I wasn’t comfortable with my data being on the internet and there being nothing I could do about it,” she says. “I’ve got a young family. I felt exposed.” McChrystal’s team put together a dossier showing all the information on her and her family that was available online, alongside a proposal for how it might be removed or, in the case of social media sites, made private. Jones, who works in marketing, represents a new kind of client: one without a specific privacy problem who has become sufficiently unnerved by recent data breaches that she is willing to spend hundreds of pounds hiring professionals to restore her anonymity.Like many people, she once used Facebook as a way of keeping a record of family life. “I’d upload photos of my children every day. I didn’t care whether or not my friends found them interesting. Now I rarely post pictures of my children – maybe the backs of their heads, but that’s it. It should be their choice, not mine. If my daughter comes to me when she is older and asks me why I put all those photos of her on the internet, I have no comeback.”In recent weeks, a grassroots movement has formed around the slogan Delete Facebook (Zuckerberg claims it has been a failure). For Meg Jayanth, a writer for video games, the Cambridge Analytica scandal pushed her willingly into Facebook oblivion. “I’d been considering deleting Facebook for at least a year, but my data anxieties were outweighed by convenience,” she told me. “Facebook was the way I stayed in touch with friends and family, and I was reluctant to leave it behind. The Cambridge Analytica news tipped the balance for me, not because it was unexpected, but because it forced me to stop rationalising away my use of the service, and act. I was sick of feeling apprehensive for using a service I didn’t even want to use any more.”The process of deleting one’s Facebook account is deliberately arcane. The social network encourages you to “deactivate” your account, rather than “delete” it, to leave an open door if you later regret the decision. Permanent deletion requires a request be made to the company. If you log in within 14 days of the process being under way (easy to do accidentally if you have the app on your phone or linked accounts that require you to log in via Facebook), the company will automatically cancel your original request.For Jayanth, who holds an Indian passport, the recent news that the US state department is asking visa applicants to declare their social media accounts on their forms was a further incentive. “The idea that customs officials might look through your social media, and could potentially make decisions based on whether or not you support the current government is dangerous. That could have a chilling effect on public debate.”Tio Bucard’s experience last year was enough to force a more thorough evaluation of his family’s privacy and safety. They never returned to their house in the French village.“This is something that happens to many of my clients,” Ahearn says. “Disappearing is a trigger that wakes a person up and makes one think carefully about what is next.”Ahearn founded a few offshore companies for Bucard, helping him buy a new house, cars and other essentials. He set the family up with a communications protocol, so they could keep in touch with family and business associates. Bucard and his wife decided to take the children out of the French education system and home school them. They took out private medical insurance to remove their names from the health system. To maintain a life of anonymity is an ongoing act of obsession, a symptom of which is often paranoia. Bucard has kept Ahearn on retainer whenever a new client comes his way, Ahearn runs checks on the person, to make sure they are who they say they are, and not connected in some way to his previous life.Complete invisibility is an impossible goal for anyone outside a witness protection programme (“The creme de la creme,” as Ahearn puts it. “If you have that, you have everything”), even for those who have never signed up for a social media or Google account. In Britain, unless you opt out when registering to vote, your data is collected and made available to anyone who wants to buy a copy.“People see the digital realm as being this separate thing, something close to unreal,” Ahearn says. “But it’s all the same thing. Would you put a picture of your child on a billboard next to a highway alongside your family name? Of course not. But people do it online all the time. And it’s not a problem. Until it is.”Some names have been changed• Commenting on this piece?

Illustration: Michael VineyWhere the hill behind us curves round to face west, there’s a stretch where it steepens sharply and is littered with glacial rocks. Any breeze from the sea – which is usual – bounces up the slope to let a kestrel hover there with spread wings and least effort: perhaps it has a wind-map in its mind of these things.“Windhover” is an old name for Falco tinnunculus (falco being the Latin for sickle, the shape of the wings, and tinnunculus for jingling, as of a bell and onomatopoeic for the kestrel’s rare cry). It is also a name I love, surviving the ecstatic densities of Gerard Manley Hopkins’s much-parsed poem. Pursuing the word’s history online brought me to a lively row over two supposedly ancient alternatives in historic English usage: “windfucker” and “windsucker”. The first is advanced in an online dictionary compiled by an American sociologist and author Douglas Harper (Online Etymology Dictionary, 2001-2018). A criticism that the elongated “s” of old manuscripts has simply been misread has prompted vigorous and erudite exchanges (see Wiktionary: Talk: windfucker).The current balance of the argument seems to be that both words have sound provenance, with the “f” word in use as synonym for “beat” or “strike” – something vigorous, anyway – in the 16th and 17th centuries, and the other as having local usage from Kent to Orkney. Of much more interest scientifically has been a Finnish study in the 1990s, which showed the hovering kestrel’s ability to track voles on the ground below through ultraviolet (UV) reflections from the urine and faeces the rodents use to scent-mark their runways.In northern Europe, and notably in Scandinavia, there are broadly four-year cycles of change that synchronise crashes in the vole population with kestrel migrations over hundreds of square kilometres. When this happens, how do the birds seek out the most promising concentrations of voles?The Finnish researchers used captive kestrels in laboratory experiments to show that they detected vole scent marks in UV light but not in visible light. Then they moved out into field trials over some 100sq km of level farmland.They ided this into areas with and without artificial vole trails of urine and faeces, and without trails at all, and distributed kestrel nesting boxes between them, 15 to each. They watched the foraging, mostly male birds for 24 mornings as they hunted near the boxes the following spring and charted their special attention to the areas with artificial scent trails.Ireland had no voles until the bank vole, Myodes variolus, arrived in the 1920s with German earth-moving machinery brought in through Foynes to build the Shannon dam at Ardnacrusha. They now extend through nearly half the island, mostly in the south and west.Another alien invader, the greater white-toothed shrew, was discovered in 2008, its little bones showing up in disgorged pellets of kestrels and barn owls in Tipperary and Limerick. The shrew is thought to have arrived en famille in the root ball of a big plant imported to an Irish garden centre now, advancing at some 5km a year, it is colonising seven counties.Ireland has been poor in small mammal species, but the two newcomers have threatened those we have, and notably the native field mouse and pygmy shrew. The latter is disappearing altogether where both aliens are present.Such changes have brought what has been called “an invasional meltdown” to the ecosystems of hedgerow and grassland. And for raptors like kestrel and barn owl, it offers a change of diet.Dr Pat Smiddy, an ornithologist and conservation ranger, decided to take some measure of change by analysing kestrel pellets across 650sq km of east Co Cork and west Co Waterford – farmland within the aliens’ known territory. From nest sites in old and ruined buildings, many of which he knew, he collected 1,057 of the pellets.Teased apart for significant bones, every site yielded bits of bank voles, especially where the greater white-toothed shrew was also present. The pygmy shrew turned up mostly where the bigger shrew was absent and never where both aliens live together. Field and house mice and brown rat – traditional kestrel prey – were low in the percentage of remains.This research into Irish kestrel diet, the most comprehensive so far, shows how important the alien mammals have become for birds of prey and the impact of their competition with native furry species. Our birds of prey are changing too, as red kite, golden and white-tailed eagles have been introduced as apex predators, so that a whole new wildlife scenario heads into the problems of climate change.Dr Smiddy’s study is published in the Biology and Environment journal of the Royal Irish Academy.

Photograph: Jane BarlowPA WirePool via ReutersThere was red, white and blue bunting as far as the eye could see on Belfast’s Shankill Road as the community gathered to celebrate the royal wedding of Britain’s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.Hundreds of people were at the Community First royal wedding party at the Linfield Supporters Club in Jumna Street on Saturday for a street party and live screening of the nuptials. Outside the venue families waving union flags basked in the glorious sunshine.While the adults chatted, ate burgers and enjoyed the weather little ones were jumping up and down on bouncy castles, having their faces painted and tucking into union flag party bags full of sweets and treats.Margaret McCauley and her daughter Anichelle posted for pictures by life-size cardboard cut outs of Harry and Meghan which were flanked by giant balloons emblazoned with ‘Shankill Road celebrates Harry Meghan 19-5-2018’. Melissa Faulkner, at the party with her children Luca and Albie, described the day as “once in a lifetime”.“Meghan is lovely,” she said.“It is nice to have somebody different in the royal family and it’s good to celebrate and keep our tradition by bringing a bit of Britain over here.”Harry and Meghan have been given the titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex, with Harry also now known as the Baron of Kilkeel, after the Co Down fishing town. Community First organiser Charlie Butler, also manager of the Linfield Supporters Club, said locals wanted to celebrate the couple and he was thrilled to welcome such a “beautiful wee girl” as Meghan into the royal family. “It is really good to see the royal family ersify,” he said. “Absolutely brilliant.”Former Lord Mayor of Belfast Brian Kingston, a DUP councillor, praised Community First and said Meghan was “a wonderful addition to the royal family”.“It will be another generation before we have this same level of royal wedding,” he said. “It is lovely to see the community coming together to enjoy the day.”Inside the club groups of women had arrived early to secure seats in front of the big screen televising the wedding coverage and service. Lyndsey Hanna is mega Meghan fan. “I love Meghan,” she said. “She’s so down to earth.”Lisa Glass, who had dressed five-month-old baby daughter Lillie in a royal themed outfit complete with union flag tutu, said the party would be a memory to look back on. “We will remember it forever,” she said.Donna Bates spoke of her joy at the community celebrating together “in good times instead of bad times”.Street parties were organised in locations across the North with a range of hotels and venues running special royal wedding themed parties.The excitement on the Shankill was shared in the city centre at the Europa Hotel, where manager James McGinn cut a dashing figure in his morning suit, as he and the Hastings team ensured a sold-out royal afternoon tea ran smoothly in the piano lounge and restaurant.“Even I got out of my bed and into my grey morning suit and yellow tie,” James said.“We have had people queuing from 10am to get the best seats.”Fizz and tea were served with sandwiches, scones and pastries, plus a special lemon and elderflower cake, similar to that chosen by the royal couple for their day. Julie Ann Kennedy from Aghalee, Co Antrim, brought her family to the event. “It’s a lovely girls afternoon out,” she said. “Meghan is an absolutely beautiful princess. The service was beautiful, very different but lovely. Meghan and Harry will help modernise the royal family for generations to come.”Cathy Wicks from Waringstown, Co Down, was at the Europa with her two sisters, her mother and her mother’s two sisters. “We love the royal family,” she said. “I think Meghan looks stunning and Harry looks dashing as ever.”Cathy’s sister Jayne Jackson thinks the royal couple are doing important work in society. “I like all the charity work they do, especially the mental health work,” she said. “It is a really important message for the royal family to use their popularity to make a difference.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3501821.1526749794!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"royal wedding the star attraction for greystones locals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAt the Whale Theatre Greystones: Catherine Donnolly Dorothy Fitzpatrick Frances Burke Marie Molloy Jo O’Farrell Catherine Boland and Sally Watson.

They enjoyed a continental breakfast, prosecco and wedding cake during the ceremony which was watched on a big screen.Revellers and wellwishers paid €15 per person and numbers were limited to 75. Tickets sold out in a matter of days.Some might wonder why you would pay to watch the wedding in a theatre when you could watch it for free in your own living room, but attendees were keen to make a day out of the occasion.“There’s big interest in the fashion and celebrity aspect of it rather than the political side. It’s a fun day. We put a lot of effort into our events to make them as magical as possible,” said Ross McPharland, proprietor of the theatre.“We all recall Prince Harry walking behind his mother’s coffin. We shared that sorrow with him so I’m just really happy for him. It’s about being happy for a young couple,” said Deirdre Fox.Deirde Vandeweert said she came to the event “to enjoy the celebrations of a real life fairytale romance”. Vivienne White said it was “an excuse for a day out with the girls”.Sarah McIlroy (8) couldn’t wait to see “Meghan in her dress and the guests in their fancy outfits and hats”. Her sister Lizzy (10) was “excited to see the Queen”.“I enjoy the pageant, the service and the music. It’s wonderful,” said David Proger, who is originally from Britain.American Bishop Michael Curry’s exuberant speech had the entire room laughing while the newlywed’s first kiss prompted a collective swoon and clapping.“It was a perfect ceremony for a perfect couple. The dress was stunning and the royals were in good form,” said Colleen Despaquale.Michelle Bolger said the Bishop “was great and very funny” and that he “added entertainment to it”.Sight of the bride’s dress was eagerly anticipated, but the gown ided opinion when finally seen.Ashling Doyle said it was “stunning, classic, simple, elegant and timeless”, while others felt it was a little too boring for the amount of money it would have cost.An organisation called Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland had erected posters around the theatre several days ago in protest of the viewing party. The posters read: Greystones Against Royal Parasites. Smash British Normalisation.The group said anyone who watched the royal wedding “should be ashamed of themselves” but it did not show up to protest at the viewing party this morning."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3500738.1526712296!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar backed 12 week proposal ahead of committee report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn publicly announcing his position last January, Leo Varadkar said he had to think “long and hard” about supporting the committee’s proposals.  Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he came to his own conclusion on how Ireland’s abortion laws should be reformed in advance of the Oireachtas committee which shaped the Government’s own proposals.Mr Varadkar largely kept his counsel as the committee conducted his work, and for weeks after it issued its report in December.However, he said on Friday he had reached the same conclusion as the Oireachtas body in advance but independently of the committee process which began in April 2017.The committee recommended the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution should be repealed and to permit abortion without restrictions for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Mr Varadkar has said legislation would be introduced along these lines if the referendum passes next Friday.The Citizens’ Assembly, which laid the ground for the Oireachtas committee, had also recommended the introduction of abortion without restriction for the first 12 weeks.“I wanted to make sure we had a proper, deliberative process,” the Taoiseach told the Don’t Stop Repealin’ podcast, citing the Citizens’ Assembly and the Oireachtas committee.“It was only after that work was done that I really wanted to let people know about the conclusions about that I had come to as well, which was very much in line with that. I think if I had announced where I was heading earlier I might have been accused of trying to influence or put pressure on members of the all-party committee, which I didn’t do.“Having studied the facts, they came to a similar view as I did, very much independently.”In publicly announcing his position last January, Mr Varadkar said he had to think “long and hard” about supporting the committee’s proposals.“In making my decision to support it, I listened to the views of others – medical experts, the public, my party and Ministers, friends. Above all, I listened to women. I had to think long and hard about the provision for abortion without a specific indication in the first 12 weeks.”“The Taoiseach’s own views were formed over a period of time. There is no particular day on which they crystallised. He was very much informed by the views of the Citizens’ Assembly, the views of the party, the public, and the all-party committee. The most important thing is that next Friday, the Irish people will have their say on an issue of crucial importance for women.

Photograph: Andrew YatesGetty ImagesTheresa May’s plan to keep Britain aligned with the EU customs union after the end of a post-Brexit transition period has run into resistance from Conservative backbenchers, with former party leader Iain Duncan Smith warning that it should not last more than a month or two.The cabinet agreed this week that the whole of the United Kingdom could remain linked to the customs union beyond the end of 2020 if trade negotiations failed to find a solution that would keep the Irish Border open.Mr Duncan Smith said Brexiteers could accept such a move but only if it was very strictly limited in duration and he warned against agreeing to an extension at this stage in the negotiations.“If they do require to have some kind of backstop, most people will accept that on the basis that it is there for practical reasons but that it is not in any way about the politics, it is wholly about the practicalities,” he told the BBC.“Pre-announcing an extension would be barking mad – you would send a signal to the EU that we don’t know what we want.”Labour’s shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said the prime minister’s proposal, which she has yet to outline in detail, was no more than a temporary measure which was an inadequate response to the issue of the Border.“If I was an investor looking to invest in my own constituency here in Rochdale, or for that matter anywhere across Northern Ireland, I’d want a bit more certainty about how long this is going to last,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to have some real fleshing-out, because no hard border is not just for 2019, 2020, it’s got to be into the long future.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said this week that a plan for customs would not be enough to resolve the Border issue, which would require Britain to retain close ties to the single market too. EU negotiators are sceptical about a customs-only solution, pointing out that border checks would still be needed for regulatory purposes.\u0026nbspBrussels has also made clear that its proposed backstop for Northern Ireland, which would see the North effectively remain in parts of the single market, will not be available to the whole of the UK.Brexiteers on the Conservative backbenches are adamant that Britain must not maintain regulatory alignment for goods with the EU after Brexit and that the country must be free to negotiate new, independent trade deals as soon as possible.Following 15 defeats in the House of Lords on the EU Withdrawal Bill, Ms May has nominated nine new Conservative life peers, including a number of former MPs. Since most of the amendments opposed by the government were passed with majorities numbered in the dozens, the appointments will not make a decisive difference to the arithmetic in the upper house.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn nominated three life peers and DUP leader in Westminster Nigel Dodds nominated former mid-Ulster MP William McCrea.\u0026nbspNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3501664.1526731076!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"prince harry and meghan markle marry at windsor castle","story":"Britain\u0027s Prince Harry has married American actress Meghan Markle in a lavish ceremony at Windsor Castle.

Photograph: Chris JacksonAFPGetty ImagesBritain’s Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle were pronounced husband and wife on Saturday by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a glittering union that brought a measure of modern Hollywood glamour into the 1,000-year-old monarchy.The star of the TV drama Suits walked unescorted in a pure white, long-sleeved dress to the middle of the 15th-century St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle, where the heir to the throne, Prince Charles, accompanied her towards his son, waiting at the altar.After exchanging vows to love and to cherish “till death us do part”, Prince Harry (33), sixth-in-line to the British throne, placed a ring of Welsh gold on Markle’s finger before a congregation including Queen Elizabeth, senior royals, and celebrities including US media mogul Oprah Winfrey.“In the presence of God, and before this congregation, Harry and Meghan have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other,” Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby intoned.“They have declared their marriage by the joining of hands and by the giving and receiving of rings. I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife.”The marriage brings Markle, three years older than Harry and born and raised in Los Angeles, into one of the world’s grandest royal families.While the ceremony incorporated the traditions of a monarchy that traces its history back to 1066, Markle brought a sense of modernity.She did not vow to obey her husband Harry, unlike other senior male royals, will wear a wedding ring Markle’s father was unable to attend due to reported heart surgery and a black U.S. Episcopalian bishop, Michael Bruce Curry, gave an impassioned wedding address on the “feeling-bomb” of love, quoting black US civil rights leader Martin Luther King.“When love is the way, we actually treat each other like we are actually family,” he said.Tens of thousands of fans lined the route Markle took towards the castle, waving British flags and cheering as her Rolls-Royce limousine drove past.Air traffic controllers for the nearby Heathrow Airport, one of the world’s busiest, closed the airspace over Windsor for the 15 minutes before the ceremony.Hours before, Queen Elizabeth had bestowed the title of Duke of Sussex on her grandson, a step that meant Markle became a duchess when she married Harry.Sunshine and bearskinsUnder clear skies and glorious sunshine, a military band in scarlet uniforms and bearskin hats entertained excited fans gathered behind barriers. Police armed with semi-automatic rifles patrolling streets and watching from rooftops.Among celebrity guests, American actor George Clooney and his wife Amal were joined by former soccer star David Beckham, his fashion designer wife Victoria and James Corden, British host of the American TV chat show The Late Late Show.Other guests included tennis ace Serena Williams, the siblings of Harry’s late mother Princess Diana, singer Elton John, who sang at Diana’s 1997 funeral, British actor Idris Elba, and two of Harry’s ex-girlfriends.The chapel was adorned with white roses, Diana’s favourite flowers.“This is a moment when we can all celebrate the rebirth of the royal family,” said Kenny McKinlay, 60, who had come down from Scotland for the wedding. “It’s a time when all the nation can come together rather than being ided. It’s a day when you can be proud to be British.”The royal couple, who met on a blind date in 2016 and fell in love in a tent under the stars in Botswana, tied the knot in a castle that has been home to 39 English monarchs since 1066.Tens of thousands of fans crammed the narrow roads of Windsor, about 30 km west of London. Visitors had to pass through police search points set up around the castle.Father not presentMarkle’s own father Thomas Markle (73), a former lighting director for TV soaps and sitcoms, pulled out of the ceremony this week, telling the US celebrity website TMZ he had had heart surgery on Wednesday.Confusion over his attendance marred the build-up to the wedding, which had been choreographed for months by royal aides, and his name still appears in the order of service.The service was conducted by the Dean of Windsor with Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual head of the Anglican Church, overseeing the exchange of vows.A black US Episcopalian bishop, Michael Bruce Curry, gave the wedding address, while Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana’s sister, delivered the reading.Prime minister Theresa May, who along with other politicians was not invited to the wedding, sent good wishes to the couple, adding: “To all of those joining the national celebration with street parties and other events, have a wonderful day.”In among traditional hymns, a choir performed American soul singer Ben E. King’s 1960s hit Stand by me.After the ceremony, the newlyweds are expected to greet some of the 1,200 members of the public invited into the castle grounds before starting a carriage procession through Windsor.A reception will be held in the castle’s St George’s Hall before 200 guests join the couple at an evening event at the nearby Frogmore House mansion.The couple will carry out their first official engagement as husband and wife next week. - Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"royal wedding countdown pictures prince harry meghan markles","story":"Newlyweds Harry and Meghan shared a tender kiss on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after pledging their love to one another at their fairytale wedding.The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex emerged from the historic church set in the grounds of Windsor Castle, beaming with delight.The couple are celebrating their royal wedding with a reception at Frogmore House.Meghan Markle\u0026#39s mother Doria Ragland wells up inside St George\u0026#39s Chapel during royal weddingInside the evening reception: First dance, Meghan\u0026#39s speech and all the gossip What next for newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle?

It showed the poise she had carried throughout the ceremony and that she was able to lead the day.It was a very Hollywood kiss. They just slightly leaned their heads to a right angle and Harry went for the lower lip which is popular on screen technique as it minimises the amount of damage done to the make-up.

Mozart probably wrote his Piano Concerto no 18 for her. She became blind at an early age but that didn’t stop her musical career. This piece probably isn’t by her – it was probably by the 20 th century violinist Samuel Dushkin. This song has been endlessly re-arranged. It’s the single most popular song by this late 19th – early 20th century composer. It sounds like a piece of Latin church music, but in fact it’s one a set of songs Schubert composed in 1825, all based on poems in Sir Walter Scott’s epic ‘The Lady of the Lake’. This one is based on a prayer uttered by Ellen in front of the Virgin Mary, asking for forgiveness for her father’s sins. All stand for the next hymn: Guide me, O thou great RedeemerView of \u0027s classical music critic Ivan Hewett: Notable not only for striking a Welsh note (appropriate for the wedding of the son of the Prince of Wales) but for its family resonances. It was sung at both Kate and William\u0027s wedding and Diana\u0027s funeral and so its inclusion may well be among the ceremony’s most poignant notes.Prayers are now being led by Archbishop Angaelos and The Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin from the Nave. The Archbishop says: In the presence of God, and before this congregation, Harry and Meghan  have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other.

The Performers are Kingdom Choir – 20 singers based in South-East London directed by Karen Gibson.

A folkyantique theme dominates in this sequence of pieces.Elgar’s first published piece. Originally written in 1888 as a gift for his future wife Carice. He sold the rights to the publisher for two guineas, which was a really bad move. It became massively popular and could have earned him a fortune.Holst taught at St Paul’s School for Girls and composed this in 1912 for the school orchestra. This movement based on 16 th century English balladParry, a leading light of the so-called ‘English Renaissance’ who was the first director of the Royal College of Music in 1883. He wrote his Lady Radnor’s suite in 1894 for the all-women orchestra conducted by Helen, Countess of Radnor. It’s a kind of Baroque Suite in Victorian dress.Set of dances based on a book of Renaissance dances composed by Peter Warlock (gifted composer who died in 1930 aged 36).Vaughan Williams was a collector of folk-song, and wrote many pieces based on the songs he found. This one is especially beloved, it’s always in Classic FM’s Hall of Fame. More famous and well-known than the tune it’s based on.Elgar’s first really successful work, completed in 1893. It remained one of his favourite works right to the end of his life. He liked it because it was ‘really stringy’ – weird phrase but a musician knows What he means – it completely suits a string orchestra, you couldn’t arrange it for something else.In his early days, Elgar was always complaining about having no money, and wrote this delicious piece in 1899 as a deliberate money-spinner for his publisher Novello.

That’s the claim being made by a team of 33 researchers published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.They are not referring to aliens in a metaphorical sense, but literal aliens from outer space.Since the paper was released on Sunday, a trickle of news coverage has turned into a torrent, with increasingly alarming headlines about octopuses and their extra-terrestrial origins. Octopus discovered making armour out of shells on Blue Planet IIIt will not come as a surprise to many to learn that these claims have been roundly mocked by the scientific community, who have branded the paper – published in Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology – as ridiculous and unscientific.What are the claims being made?They suggest the Cambrian explosion, a sudden burst of life that occurred around 540 million years ago, was the result of extra-terrestrial intervention.\u0026nbspThe paper asks whether this event, which saw the rapid emergence of most of the main animal groups that still exist on Earth today, was “terrestrial or cosmic”. Their conclusion is the latter.How do the scientists suggest this would work?Specifically, the researchers propose the idea that alien viruses crashed to Earth in a meteor, infected a population of primitive squid and caused them to evolve into octopuses.\u0026nbspAnother theory they suggest is that fertilised squid or octopus eggs were delivered to Earth by a meteor.Are octopuses aliens from outer space? This peer-reviewed article by 33 scientists argues that the octopus genome is too complex to have evolved naturally on earth and therefore that octopuses probably came...from space\u0026nbsphttps:t.coR7qE77AGrJ\u0026nbsppic.twittervgDC5vgDz6The idea is essentially a\u0026nbspreimagining\u0026nbspof the “panspermia” hypothesis, which suggests that life on Earth was “seeded” by space dust or asteroids crashing into Earth. One of its first proponents,\u0026nbspChandra\u0026nbspWickramasinghe, is one of the authors of the new paper.Why do the researchers look at the octopus in particular?Octopuses are weird. They are molluscs, meaning they are closely related to snails, and yet they are incredibly intelligent.\u0026nbspOn top of their large brains and sophisticated nervous systems, the authors of the new paper list camera-like eyes, flexible bodies and ability to camouflage themselves by changing colour and shape as evidence of their extra-terrestrial origins.So suddenly did these features appear in the octopus family tree that “it is plausible then to suggest they seem to be borrowed from a far distant ‘future’ in terms of terrestrial evolution, or more realistically from the cosmos at large,” the authors write.\u0026nbsp“Such an extraterrestrial origin as an explanation of emergence of course runs counter to the prevailing dominant paradigm,” they continue. This is a strong contender for understatement of the century.What reason is there to doubt the claims being made in the paper?There are plenty of reasons. First off, as Mark\u0026nbspCarnall\u0026nbspfrom the Oxford University Museum of Natural History pointed out in a series of tweets, not one of the paper’s authors is a zoologist.\u0026nbspMuch of the authors’ speculation rests on the idea that the genetics of octopuses and their relatives are mysterious – yet a\u0026nbsp2015 paper published in\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsprevealed the octopus genome, so this is rather disingenuous.In fact, octopus genes suggest they fit into the generally understood theory of the evolution of life on Earth, and require no alien invasion. They are thought to have split from the squid lineage around 135 million years ago.Molecular geneticist Professor\u0026nbspKarin\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspof the Max Planck Institute Molecular Genetics, who was asked to review the report, concluded that it cannot be taken seriously”.The primary reason for doubt given by Professor\u0026nbspMoelling\u0026nbspis that there is “no evidence at all”.Haven’t I heard something about octopuses being aliens before?Writers are fond of comparing octopuses to aliens due to their unusual appearance and great intelligence. Philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith, who has written a book about octopus intelligence titled\u0026nbspOther Minds, has described them as “the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien”.On top of that, this is not the first time octopuses have been mistakenly labelled aliens by the press.\u0026nbspAn unfortunately worded press release concerning the\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbsppaper describing the octopus genome led to a slew of online news pieces in 2015 about researchers finding “alien DNA” in these creatures.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

There are also 181 peers sitting as crossbenchers.Lords defeats government to back EU eco-standards after BrexitCorbyn ‘must take chance to keep UK in single market’ after May defeatPeers inflict major defeat on government over single marketLord speaker confirms Trump could speak in parliament despite banLords plan to let Trump address Parliament in defiance of Bercow’s banMs May shelved plans earlier this year to slash the number of peers, after a cross-party report recommended cutting the numbers in the Lords from nearly 800 to 600 in a decade.The Lord Speaker’s Committee recommended limiting any peer’s term to 15 years and adopting a new “two-out, one in” system to accelerate a reduction in size.   However Ms May retreated from the more radical plans, which she said needed “careful thought” and instead pledged to show “restraint” in her appointments.Meanwhile, Ms Osamor’s elevation was described as a “two-fingered salute” to the Jewish community, after the campaigner signed a letter protesting against the suspensions of party members over antisemitism.Gideon Falter, chairman of the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: “Mr Corbyn has promised action, not just words, against antisemitism in the Labour Party.“Today his actions speak louder than ever. By elevating Ms Osamor to the peerage, Mr Corbyn has sent an unmistakable signal to those in the Jewish community who still harboured some hope that he might change.”I’m a millennial and I’m sick of how entitled my peers areMs Osamor said in a statement that she was “implacably opposed to antisemitism” and had spent her life campaigning against racism and discrimination.Liberal Democrat leader in the Lords, Dick Newby, said the move was a “desperate bid” by Ms May to reduce opposition to her flagship Brexit legislation in the upper chamber.“The fact that she is doing this on the Friday evening before the royal wedding is frankly pathetic,” he said.“This is a desperate grab for power by a regime losing its grip on parliament, public opinion and even its own back benches. The Prime Minister is running scared of the mounting criticism of her disastrous handling of Brexit.“These appointments show the PM isn’t serious about reforming the Lords and smacks of hypocrisy.”Tommy Sheppard, the SNP’s Lords spokesman, described the decision as a “real affront to democracy”.He added: “The Tories are not even trying to disguise this – it is a complete fix.“By creating even more peers in a desperate attempt to force through their chaotic Brexit they are showing a despicable disregard. Even for the Tories this is shabby.’’ UK news in picturesUK news in picturesWorkers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesSanta Fe High School student Dakota Shrader is comforted by her mother Susan Davidson following a shooting at the school in Texas.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The account said “history spits in the face of the country’s traitors”.The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front page a photo of Ms Hathloul and Ms Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Senior gures including Tony Blair, George Osborne and Lord Ashdown, are understood to have been involved in the talks.Yet such plotting ignores the question of whether there is an appetite among voters for yet another pro-Brussels grouping.Renew, a tiny anti-Brexit party launched earlier this year, fought several wards in London at the council elections earlier this month.In the poll every Renew candidate was defeated in the poll, including a sitting councillor who had defected from the Tories.Even more problematic for the new party plotters in Labour, Tory and Lib Dem ranks is that the single issue that unites them is a desire to overturn the result of the 2016 EU referendum.They have little hope of developing a new vision for the country\u0026rsquos future as long as they remain obsessed Cwith reversing the tide of history.Longing on to the dream that Brexit can be stopped is also distracting MPs fed up with their existing parties from making the break and building a new organisation from scratch.The drawn-out parliamentary progress of Brexit legislation means there is always one more crunch battle for the Remainers to fight.A series of victories by a cross- party anti-Brexit alliance in the House of Lords shows the diehard Brussels supporters can be far more effective staying where they are rather than coming together into a single force that could struggle to build electoral appeal.Mr Miliband refused to say anything about his future ambitions after delivering his lecture about the dangers looming in the Brexit negotiations.Mr Miliband refused to say anything about his future after his lecture about Brexit Negotiations.He jetted back to the US leaving those who see him as the potential leader of a new force still guessing about the future.Lost centrists yearning for a new party have little hope of Bananaman or any other superhero swooping out of the skies any time soon."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/Kate-Middleton-Princess-Charlotte-Royal-Wedding-962104.jpg","title":"royal wedding kate middleton dress duchess of Cambridge wearing meghan markle pictures hat","story":"Kate opted for a light yellow coat by\u0026nbspAlexander McQueen so all eyes were on Meghan when she arrived at the chapel.The Duchess of Cambridge helped Meghan\u0027s young bridesmaids, including Princess Charlotte, as they arrived on steps of St George\u0027s Chapel.And she flashed the crowds a quick smile as she assisted the little ones up into the church.Princess Charlotte looked adorable as she gave a wave to wedding well-wishers at the top of the steps as the Duchess of Cambridge held her hand up the steps of St Georges\u0026rsquos Chapel.The children were then handed flowers behind the door when one of the little bridesmaids began to cry.PAKate Middleton with daughter Princess Charlotte at the Royal Wedding                Gabriel Macht leads Suits stars at Royal Wedding                Prince Harry arrives to say \u0027I do\u0027 to Meghan Markle for Royal WeddingKate then entered the church and sat next to Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall before Meghan Markle arrived at church for the Royal Wedding.A Kensington Palace statement said: \u0026ldquoHer Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge will be wearing a primrose yellow wool silk tailored coat by Alexander McQueen.\u0026ldquoThe Duchess of Cambridge is wearing a hat designed by Philip Treacy and shoes by Jimmy Choo.Royal watchers were quick to notice the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s coat was similar to three previous outfits.Kate previous wore the same style coat to Charlotte\u0027s christening with a white hat and again at the Queen\u0027s birthday with a pink hat.Re-wearing the coat was undoubtedly a move to keep the focus on Meghan and her dress which until now had been kept a heavily guarded secret.EPARoyal Wedding: Kate Middleton helps Meghan Markle\u0027s bridesmaids up the steps of St George\u0027s ChapelRoyal Wedding: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their children George and CharlotteKate helped with Meghan\u0027s bridesmaids who were earlier named as Florence van Cutsem, aged three, who is the goddaughter of Prince Harry and daughter of Alice van Cutsem and Major Nicholas van Cutsem as well as the Duchess\u0027s own daughter Princess Charlotte.Meghan Markle\u0027s goddaughters Remi Litt, aged six, and Rylan Litt, aged seven, are bridesmaids as will Ivy Mulroney, aged four, the daughter of Meghan\u0026rsquos close friends Jessica Mulroney and Benedict Mulroney and Zalie Warren, aged two, the goddaughter of Prince Harry.Kate\u0027s son Prince George was joined by Jasper Dyer, aged six, who is the godson of Prince Harry, Brian Mulroney, aged seven, and John Mulroney, aged seven \u0026ndash the twin sons of Meghan\u0027s friends Jessica and Benedict Mulroney.Meghan Markle: First look at her wedding dress.

Getty Images1 of 30Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding in picturesAs a orcee and campaigner for women\u0026rsquos rights, Meghan had always insisted that she didn\u0026rsquot want to be \u0026ldquogiven away but arrive at the chapel on her own, having been driven to Windsor Castle with her proud mother Doria Ragland, 61, the only member of Meghan\u0026rsquos family in the pews.The order of service was produced before it became clear that Thomas Markle would not be attending after pulling out of the ceremony with heart problems.Charles awaited Meghan at the start of the Quire, half way down the 15th century chapel, as she gracefully made her way down towards her future husband accompanied by her six bridesmaids and four page boys, which included Prince George and Princess Charlotte, adorably all holding hands.The Dean of Windsor the Most Reverend David Conner greeted the 600-strong congregation, which as well as the Royal Family included celebrities such as George and Amal Clooney, David and Victoria Beckham, Elton John and American chat show host Oprah Winfrey.Tennis star Serena Williams, a close friend of Meghan\u0026rsquos, was also present along with Harry\u0026rsquos former nanny Tiggy Pettier and former Prime Minister Sir John Major.Family and friends of the couple were met by the subtle scent of fresh flowers as they entered through doors adorned with a floral arch of luscious green foliage, white peonies and roses.The Queen, wearing a lime green outfit by Stuart Parvin and matching Angela Kelly hat, was the last to arrive, five minutes before the start of the ceremony, with Prince Philip, 96, who walked down the aisle unaided despite undergoing hip replacement surgery last month.The first hymn Lord of Hopefulness, set to the the melody of an Irish folksong called Slane, is typically sung by Catholic congregations in the US - a reflection, perhaps of Meghan being educated at LA\u0026rsquos Immaculate Heart Catholic high school.In the Declarations part of the service, the couple appeared surprisingly relaxed as they were asked to promise to love, comfort, honour, and protect one another and be faithful to one another for the rest of their lives.Meghan had reportedly been practising her vows by recording herself reciting them and listening to them over and over again before the ceremony.As a trained actress, used to having to remember lines, the former Suits star\u0026rsquos performance was flawless - her American accent ringing out of the chapel walls via a relay system that ensured the hundreds and thousands gathered outside could hear every word of the ceremony.There were cheered from the crowds of hundreds of thousands outside as both they answered \u0026ldquoI will when asked by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby if they would \u0026ldquoforsake all others and be faithful so long as you both shall live?Never far from Harry\u0026rsquos thoughts, there was an inevitable nod to Princess Diana in the singing of the hymn Guide Me O Thy Great Redeemer, which was played at her funeral in 1997.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s wedding was arguably the most progressive in royal historyOtherwise known as Bread of Heaven, the hymn is also likely to have been chosen by rugby fan Harry because it is the unofficial of the Welsh rugby team.Prince Harry\u0026rsquos aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, the late princess\u0026rsquos older sister gave a faultless reading from the Song of Solomon, which stresses the strength and power of love and contains the line: \u0026ldquoFor love is strong as death, passion fierce as the grave.Lady Jane, whose husband Baron Robert Fellowes is a former private secretary to the Queen, also gave a reading at Diana\u0027s funeral in 1997. Diana\u0026rsquos other siblings Earl Spencer and Lady Sarah McCorquodale were also present.It was then time for the choir of St George\u0026rsquos Chapel, conducted by director of music James Vivian to sing the Motet \u0026ldquoIf ye love me by Thomas Tallis.Kensington Palace said the couple had thought carefully about the music and hymns and other parts of the ceremony, and also turned to Charles for help.The service also featured one of the prince\u0026rsquos favourite composers Sir Hubert Parry, a figure he once made a documentary about, as well as works by Sir Edward Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Johann Sebastian Bach.American preacher Curry flew in from his native Chicago to give the address, in which he struck a surprisingly Evangelical note, speaking for a lot longer than was originally expected.Although Meghan appeared transfixed by the sermon, there were moments when the Queen and fellow royals appeared unsure what to make of his references to \u0026ldquoflashes of fire and Dr King\u0026rsquos declaration that \u0026ldquolove is the only way.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were the picture of happinessSeemingly to realise he was overrunning, he joked that he should stop speaking, saying: \u0026ldquoWe got to get y\u0026rsquoall married.There were more laughs when he asked guests if any of them had travelled to the castle in a car, and then joked that he knew there were carriages around.One of the ceremony\u0026rsquos highlights was a touching rendition of soul singer Ben E King\u0026rsquos 1961 hit Stand By Me, sung by the Kingdom Choir, a 20-strong group of Christian gospel singers from south London.The choir stood at the back of the chapel and guests all turned around in their seats to take in the scene.Some guests wanted to clap at the end, but seemed unsure about whether it was appropriate.Unlike his brother, Harry chose to wear a wedding ring.Having joked about losing the wedding rings before the ceremony, the Archbishop had no problem handing them over to the couple, who in turn managed to place them effortlessly on each other\u0026rsquos fingers. Following royal tradition, Meghan\u0026rsquos wedding ring was fashioned from a nugget of Welsh gold, gifted by the Queen.You could hear a pin drop as the couple said their vows, promising to \u0026ldquohave and to hold from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part.A few moments later, at 12.40pm, Harry and Meghan were proclaimed to be husband and wife.PAMeghan Markle is the first ever Duchess of SussexCheers from the crowds outside prompted a laugh from the guests in the congregation, who could hear the excitement of people in the castle grounds.After the marriage was blessed, Chaplain to the Queen the Reverend Prebendary Rose Hudson-Wilkin read the prayers from the Nave along with Coptic Orthodox of London Archbishop His Eminence Archbishop Angaelos, who lead the Lord\u0026rsquos Prayer.It was the first time a Coptic Orthodox clergyman has taken part in a major royal religious occasion.As the royal newlyweds disappeared to sing the registers - a private moment that was not caught on camera - teenage cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, the BBC\u0026rsquos Young Musician of the Year, entertained the congregation with three stunning performances, concluding with Schubert\u0026rsquos Ave Maria.The bride and groom then returned to sing the National Anthem, with Meghan singing the words for the first time as Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex.Walking away from the altar as a newly married couple, Harry and Meghan smiled broadly as they made their way towards the door of the chapel as the gospel choir sang Etta James\u0027 version of the gospel classic AmenThis Little Light of Mine.The performances prompted enthusiastic applause from the congregation, now feeling the moment was right to show their appreciation for the choir.In the order of service, the guests could read a note on the second page saying: A wedding is one of life\u0027s great moments, a time of solemn commitment as well as good wishes, feasting and joy."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/183x122/962232_1.jpg","title":"the queen prince harry royal wedding beard","story":"Prince Harry was given special permission from the Queen to sport facial hair while wearing uniform.It is customary to be clean-shaven when dressed in Army uniform.Both the newly-appointed Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals during Harry\u0027s wedding to former Hollywood actress Meghan.In a statement, Kensington Palace said: Her Majesty The Queen gave her permission for Prince Harry to get married in his uniform.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Veils, polka dots, puff sleeves, she was always trying new things.Would she have liked Meghan? I think so.She’d have run her eye up and down her because although she wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box academia-wise, she had an A+ in intuition, but the important thing to her would be to know that she loved her son.If you could show her that then that would have been enough.If Diana was alive today I’ve no doubt she would be heavily involved with Meghan and Catherine and her grandchildren – and she would have been a very fun grandma.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Negotiator Michel Barnier reportedly says the Tories are wasting their breath since he intends to reject either solution.He is stoking the Irish border problem and privately mocking Mrs May’s discomfort. It is dangerously destructive. We should challenge Brussels to help us make Boris’s solution work. If it won’t help, we should walk away. It would be bad for the EU, Barnier and us. But it looks more inevitable by the day.SIXTY dead, thousands allegedly wounded. The Gaza bloodbath should horrify even Israel’s staunchest supporters.It is hard to argue that shooting live rounds into a crowd is proportionate. But consider the terrifying threat Israel faces. This was not a peaceful demo. Hamas, the terror group sworn to wipe Israel off the map, aims to use it to penetrate the border and kidnap Jews.“We will tear out their hearts,” its leader has said. Some Jewish families live near the fence. Israel is right to fear for them.But its ruthlessness has handed Hamas the PR coup it cynically craves.MPs have again spared the Press and public a costly new “Leveson 2” witch-hunt.We congratulate Culture Secretary Matt Hancock and the 301 MPs who put Press freedom first. We doubt the rest, the Lords or Hacked Off will ever call it a day. But the media has changed beyond recognition since the last inquiry. Facebook and Google dominate.

Surprisingly good shape if you’re one of those Remainer banshees who said the entire country would be worth about two bob by now — no investment, no jobs, swarms of killer bees and plagues of locusts.Not a bit of it. Take employment. We now have the highest employment levels, and the lowest unemployment, for 42 years. We have an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.Would you like to know how our major European partners are getting on in that regard? Well, it’s 9.2 per cent in France, 10.8 per cent in Italy, a whopping 16.4 per cent in Spain and, of course, 20.9 per cent in chicken-in-a-basket case Greece.We’re even closing in on Germany, at 3.6 per cent.So that’s not bad for starters. Average earnings are at last rising, too. Inflation is down. Business investment is up.Better still, we are experiencing the kind of export boom we haven’t seen for a long time. A massive ten per cent increase in the past year.And for those who think this will all come to a halt when we actually leave the EU — um, no.The official statistics predict the boom is going to grow and grow. By 2020 it will have increased by 22 per cent. Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag. Just not us.Mind you, I think I’d give Russia a swerve either way.If the Russki thugs don’t get you, then the police will.And you’ll have difficulty telling them apart. Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not. Yet it’s all I’ve heard about on the news recently.I’m not being mean. I hope they all have a lovely day.But I couldn’t give a monkey’s if Meghan was led up the aisle by her dad, or Piers Morgan, or a flock of cackling greylag geese.In truth, Meghan and the royals aside, does anyone else?ISRAEL has over-reacted in trying to control the Palestinians rioting by the border fence.It’s handed a huge propaganda coup to the racist terrorists of Hamas. They’re the ones who provoked the rioters. Told them to break down the fence and kill Jews.But all that gets forgotten when there’s TV footage of Israeli soldiers shooting people. Even if they are bombarded with Molotov cocktails.It’s still the case that the biggest barrier to peace is Hamas, not Israel.LIKE you, I’m working on my hip cleavage so I’ll look dead good on the beach this summer.I’m going to have my bikini bottom glued somewhere just below my armpits, in order to look like Bella Hadid or Genie Bouchard or Alessandra Ambrosio.It all reminds me of the old joke. Young bloke complains that no girls on the beach fancy him. Won’t even look at him.So his friend advises: “Put a couple of potatoes in your trunks. Then they’ll look.”Young bloke comes back the next day and says: “It’s even worse. Now they run away from me.”His friend looks at his trunks and says: “I meant put the potatoes down the FRONT of your trunks, not the back.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mrs May cannot even rely on her own MPs.Consider what she’s up against:An EU which has spent two years playing games, either to reverse Brexit or extract a fortune from us while nullifying us as an economic threat.Unelected peers, contemptuous not only of the referendum verdict but the democracy that produced it.Tory backbenchers putting their party’s very existence a distant second to getting their own way on Europe.And a Labour Party solely concerned with ousting the Tories, even if it means wrecking our negotiating strategy.The PM’s task is being made impossible.THE problem on some of our train lines is not that they need to be nationalised. It’s that they aren’t privatised enough.True competition would drive fares down and standards up. Instead the network’s regional monopolies provide no choice of how to get from A to B, regardless of how pricey or poor the service.Labour is cock-a-hoop the Transport Secretary has temporarily taken the failing East Coast line into state hands.They think it vindicates doing so to the entire system. It doesn’t. We don’t need nationalised trains — and national strikes on the whim of union bullies.We need rival firms competing on the same lines. Why not? Airlines manage it.THE NHS is in a sorry state if it is begging Help For Heroes for a handout.There is no excuse. The Government must fully fund speedier mental health treatment for our war veterans.But the health service’s financial woes will persist while — despite our soaring, ageing population and ever pricier drugs — we insist on it providing exactly the same care it always has.We need a Royal Commission to produce a long-term, cross-party plan for the NHS, its future role and how to fund it.FOR decades Judy Finnigan was telly gold.She didn’t always seem comfortable with it.

When the EU finally decides it is happy for new technology to monitor the Irish border.Never, in other words.It is already sneering it will take till 2085. It will use any excuse.We are told Britain would be free to sign trade deals during that time. But how could we negotiate without the flexibility to diverge from EU rules?We would be nominally “out”, yet forever marching in lockstep with it over trade. “Perpetual purgatory”, as Jacob Rees-Mogg rightly calls it.Theresa May is under huge pressure. But this is not seizing the opportunity Brexit presents. It is defeatism, attempted damage limitation without realising the REAL damage of a half-Brexit.The Cabinet is running scared of Brussels and Tory Remainers, as the EU ratchets up the panic.The alternative is to leave with no deal.

Now we partly rely on the murderous, flaky Putin regime’s gas. We have to get cracking with fracking, like the US.And the Government must launch a PR offensive to convince a doubting nation it is clean and safe.IT would be insane not to ban combustible cladding on tower blocks after Grenfell.And it should be mandatory to test panels physically.We know the tragedy had several causes.

It needs to change to survive.Prime Minister Theresa May won as many votes last year as Margaret Thatcher did in her prime.She earned the party its biggest share of working-class votes since 1979.The Conservatives are now back ahead in the polls.But across some of the parts of the population that are growing the fastest, the Conservatives are still trailing behind Labour.In last year’s General Election, Jeremy Corbyn’s Little Red Book did not just win over university students.He also won over half of people in their thirties.A recent poll showed only nine per cent of those aged 25 to 39 say they will definitely vote Conservative.The Conservatives are behind among people who rent their homes privately — and there are twice the number doing that as there were in 2000.Nearly four times as many people from ethnic minority communities voted Labour than voted Tory — and those different communities are a growing part of our population.So if the Conservative Party does not broaden its reach, it is finished. It is that simple.That does not mean the Prime Minister should copy Corbyn’s empty promises.Let’s not forget that Labour’s most recent manifesto proposed to raise taxes to their highest level since World War Two.Or that Corbyn’s plans to borrow huge, unprecedented sums of money to embark on a spending spree would put a millstone of debt around the necks of younger people.Or that the only thing he wants to cut is our defence budget — and from the Falklands to Russia, he has a bad habit of siding with Britain’s enemies.The Tories have spent eight years cleaning up the mess Labour left behind. We do not want to repeat their mistakes.We remember the dangerous situation where the Government was borrowing a quarter of all the money it spent.We did the hard yards slashing the dole queues Labour left behind, and now we have got more people in work than ever before.But we can not just rest on our record. There are five big challenges we need to solve if we are going to deserve the votes of Sun readers at the next election.The FIRST is obvious — we have to make a success of Brexit. We should ignore pompous members of the House of Lords who say we should just override the democratic result of the referendum.But we should make sure we listen when businesses and exporters say they want sensible arrangements to keep business flowing between Britain and Europe. That’s exactly what the PM is negotiating.The SECOND is to give young people at least the same chances to get on in life that older people have enjoyed.That means reversing 15 years of falling home ownership and building more homes that young working people can afford.But it also means reforming taxes to focus on growing the number of homeowners, not just expanding the amount of rented property.The THIRD challenge is to build a united Britain and make the Conservative Party feel like the natural home for working people, whatever their race or religion.We believe we must continue to strongly control immigration and stop illegal immigration. But we also believe in making sure everyone can feel part of Britain.We admire those who have come here with nothing and built amazing businesses — and we know that the Conservative priorities of enterprise, family and education are often their priorities, too.Many feel very patriotic about this great country that is now their home. That is why we, as a party, must do much more to reach out to ethnic minority communities.It is why, in government, we must make sure that everyone, no matter their background, gets help to speak good English so they can get a good job and be part of a united country.FOURTH, we need to do much more to help places that have suffered in recent decades. Not just by aiding big cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham — some of which are now growing faster than London.But also by tackling deprivation in the neglected smaller towns and coastal communities where opportunities have been hard to come by for years.FIFTH, we must build an economy that really does work for everyone, not just the well-off.It is brilliant that unemployment is at a 40-year low. But wages fell a long way in the last recession and though they are growing, working people have been through a very difficult decade.Policies such as the National Living Wage and tax cuts for the lower-paid have helped those who want to work, earn more and keep more of their earnings.But now we have to find ways to raise average wages and help businesses invest in their workers.Government should be taking more of a role in helping people to retrain between jobs or to work in new industries to reduce the impact of new technology.And we must do more to help working families with everyday costs of living. That means cutting high energy bills and helping working families who face some of the most expensive childcare in the developed world.If we do these things and govern always in the interests of working people, we can beat Corbyn’s tried-and-failed 1970s politics.By becoming the party for working people, the Conservative Party can earn a solid majority and make Britain fairer — and more united.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She got her Brexit inner Cabinet to agree that in the event of no trade deal being in place by December 2020, the UK would continue to apply the EU’s common external tariff.The decision goes back to the issue of the Irish border and the “backstop” May agreed last December. This said that in the event of no deal being done, the UK would keep Northern Ireland in line with EU rules on customs, agriculture and manufactured goods.The DUP, the Ulster party on which Mrs May depends for her Commons majority, would never accept a Northern Ireland-only deal. So the Government wants to apply this backstop to the whole UK.The situation is far from ideal. It shows why the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, was right to have such misgivings about the backstop. He argued that by agreeing what would happen in the event of ‘no deal’ the UK was reducing its negotiating leverage.There is also a danger the backstop reduces the EU’s incentive to negotiate a comprehensive free-trade deal.Brexiteer ministers are intrigued by new Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s idea of keeping the customs revenues collected under the backstop in trust, only handing them over to the EU once the final deal is done.The UK’s position in these talks has been weakened by its failure to properly prepare for no deal.The EU knows the UK isn’t ready to walk away so it keeps pushing, knowing the need for a deal means we will almost certainly fold in the end.The final problem is that the UK still doesn’t know precisely what it wants. The backstop is only meant to apply if either a trade deal or technology can’t solve the Irish border problem.But right now there is more agreement in the Brexit inner Cabinet on the backstop — which, officially, they don’t want to happen — than on either of those two options.I understand from those involved in ministerial working groups looking at customs options they are still a long way off any conclusions. I am also told these working groups aren’t coming up with answers but doing “preparatory work to inform a later discussion”.So why aren’t Brexiteers kicking off at all these cans been kicked down the road?Well, as one influential figure, explains to me: “It is all very unsatisfactory but it is what it is.” In other words, given the mistakes that have been made, there isn’t really an alternative.The other reason is the view among several of the most important Brexiteers that they can’t get what they want at the moment, so they should play it long. The thinking goes that it is better to accept more temporary measures than to agree to bad permanent arrangements.But it is being whispered in Westminster that if Brexiteers are to get what they want, they need control of the government machine — and that means one of their own in Number 10.Moving against Theresa May now is simply too risky.Bringing her down could bring Brexit down.But in the past week, the talk of a challenge to her shortly after Britain has legally, if not practically, left the EU has risen in volume.Those around Mrs May want her to fight the next election.They also argue that any leadership contest before the whole Brexit process is done would risk splitting the Tories beyond repair.But this week, the chances of a challenge to Mrs May soon after March 30 next year substantially increased.ALL eyes will be on Windsor today for the Royal Wedding – but in Westminster, Tories are getting increasingly excited about the possibility of some political nuptials.On Monday night, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove will launch a new group designed to craft a post-Brexit agenda for the party. This joint appearance has set tongues wagging and left Tories wondering if they could one day be joined in political union.Davidson and Gove were on opposite sides of the Brexit referendum and until recently, she was – in private – no fan of his. But that has changed.One ally of hers tells me: “Relations are warmer than they have ever been.” What has brought them together? Fish. Davidson knows it is politically vital for Scottish Tories to secure a clean break from the Common Fisheries Policy.And Gove, whose adopted father was an Aberdeen fish merchant, is an ally against Chancellor Philip Hammond’s desire to use fishing as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.The question is whether this alliance of convenience could develop into something more lasting. Many Tories still dream of Davidson coming south after the Scottish Parliament elections in 2021. They think her charisma, combined with Gove’s radicalism, would be just the ticket.But there are huge logistical challenges to getting Davidson to Westminster before the next election, even if she wanted to. So could she back Gove?I am told she is keeping her options open at the moment. But what is certain is that whoever she did back would get a massive boost.If Davidson is not going to try to be queen, she can be the Tory kingmaker.So one wonders what Bercow, the Speaker of the House, would say about a minister calling someone a “stupid woman”.Yet tellingly, his office’s statement doesn’t deny the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, that in a private aside on Wednesday.But there are no signs of a public apology from Bercow.It is hard not to conclude that he is determined to hang on to his job whatever damage he does to the role.ITALY, one of the founding members of the EU, is set to be governed by a populist coalition who want to renegotiate key parts of the European project.The biggest threat the new Italian government poses is to the future of the Eurozone. The new coalition’s programme would cost more than 100billion euros. This will put them in breach of the Eurozone’s deficit rules. To add insult to injury, the European Central Bank (ECB) buys a substantial amount of Italy’s sovereign debt.So the ECB would effectively be financing part of this programme.The result will be a backlash in northern European countries. They will wonder why Italy should get away with this. The result: The prospect of proper reform to fix the Eurozone’s structural weaknesses is dead.This is the Eurozone’s problem. Politics makes the reforms it needs impossible. Next time a global financial crisis hits, the Eurozone will have unique vulnerabilities.She said Tory MPs were telling her that both the party and the country needed unity at this moment and noises off didn’t help with that.But I am told the Prime Minister’s appeals on this front are becoming so frequent they are losing their force.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both sides want a deal. But if the EU also tries to cripple us as a trading power, there are 60 Brexit-backing Tories ready to veto it.The PM has made many concessions to the EU already. She must be more militant.WHY is the grotesquely self-important toad John Bercow still Commons Speaker?For years he has polluted proceedings with his verbose grandstanding, interrupting MPs to rebuke them at tedious length for some minor transgression.His endless convoluted put-downs take up precious debating time.Bercow already faces two bullying accusations which he denies and MPs strangely do not wish to probe.Now, after yet another unhinged rant, he seems to have branded Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman”.

Kings 1960s hit Stand By Me to the couple, who had earlier been given their new titles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.They were soon able to meet the rapturous crowds of more than 100,000 people as they were taken through Windsor in a carriage.Meanwhile, speaking from the US, the brides father Thomas Markle said she looked beautiful.The 73-year-old, who was unable to attend the wedding after recently undergoing heart surgery, said he wished he was with his daughter on her big day.Majesty Magazines Ms Seward added that the star of the wedding was the American preacher, The Most Reverend Michael Curry, saying it was nice to see the royal family relax during the ceremony.Royal historian Sarah Gristwood, who wrote Elizabeth - The Queen and Crown, told The Sun Online that the wedding had thrust the Royal Wedding into the 21st century.She said that while it was already known that Meghan would enter the chapel alone, it hadnt been realised just how different the ceremony would be.Ms Gristwood added: It was partly the strong American presence and partly the strong black presence.Not only the bride and groom said I do but the congregation and family said I will.A lot of lessons were learned from Princess Dianas life and death - and this feels like one of them.Weve obviously seen some turmoil in Meghans family this week and this was a real open recognition of both of the potential for family trouble and family support.But royal expert Dickie Arbiter, the Queens former press spokesman, told The Sun Online said the Royal Family had always been evolving, saying that Prince Harry and brother Prince William were following in their mothers footsteps.He said: It was a great example of how the monarchy continues to evolve.But we can’t forget that it’s been changing and evolving for the past 1,000 years.He said that Prince Charles holding mother-of-the-bride Doria Raglands hand as she left the pews was a way of showing they were now family.Peter Rolfe, owner of luxury events organiser PAVE London, added: What is obvious is how much the black community have been featured in the ceremony so far, which is different from previous royal weddings.Its nice to put in Meghans heritage with the head of the Episcopal Church was probably the most memorable speaker in the ceremony.He was very arousing. His speech about love caught everyone in the church by surprise in the church.Some of the faces in the church showed they werent expecting such a rousing address.The whole day has been a blend of tradition, which the American guests will love, and modern elements, such as the choir singing Stand By Me. It shows Harry and Meghan are very much in love and blending their backgrounds. The Royal Family were front and centre in the chapel, with the Queen and an unaided 96-year-old Prince Philip - recovering after a hip op - cheered as they walked into the chapel this morning.The Duchess of Cambridge was also among the guests, making sure that bridesmaid Princess Charlotte and pageboy Prince George were on their best behaviour.Newborn Prince Louis didnt make an appearance - staying at home with the nanny.And the Markles mum Doria, who flew into London from the US this week, was seen in tears during the ceremony.She had joined her 36-year-old daughter as they were driven from the chapel from Cliveden House in the drive in a vintage Rolls-Royce Phantom to the chapel.Kensington Palace confirmed that the Royal brothers would be wearing the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals, with the Queen giving her permission for Prince Harry to marry in his uniform.The dress focuses on the open bateau neckline that slightly shows the shoulders, with a figure fitting sculpted waistline.Its made of six seams, with a flowing train and an underskirt made of triple silk organza.It also has three-quarter length sleeves.Givenchy also created the stunning five metre long veil, which is decorated with hand-embroidered flowers representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth - a design detail requested by Meghan.

It was very close, very personal, very intimate and very beautiful. It was a really mesmerising experience.Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said of Bishop Currys sermon: I think what we saw in that is that preaching is not a past art, the use of language to communicate the good news of Jesus Christ just blew the place open, it was fantastic.He also said members of the Royal Family were excited and gripped by Bishop Currys sermon.His stirring address quoted Martin Luther King, saying: We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love.And when we do that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world.

an honour bestowed by the Queen.It is the Queens prerogative that senior members of the royal family are promoted in line with their peers because they hold royal military appointments.Harry left the armed forces in June 2015 and was first spotted with a beard in September the same year.He kept his beard when he wore a military dress coat at the Cenotaph last November – a move which prompted criticism from some quarters."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004008816473.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"roslyn markle thomas meghan open letter royal wedding","story":"Roslyn Markle, 72, told how she blasted eldest son Thomas Jr for the public attack on Meghan -

However, it is not known whether that will be in the wedding chapel, at the Frogmore reception, or both.Sir Elton holds a special place in Harry\u0027s heart as the singer was a close friend of his late mother, Diana, and penned and performed Candle In The Wind for her funeral in 1997.The Rocket Man singer also attended William and Kate\u0027s wedding in 2011 and he has rescheduled two concert dates which were meant to be happening this weekend.Keeping with the British theme, there were rumours the Spice Girls may also sing, with Mel B - Scary Spice - apparently letting slip that the band would be performing at the royal wedding.But Mel C - Sporty Spice - then said she was \"joking\".:: Royal wedding 2018: The ultimate guide Chart toppers Ed Sheeran, Sam Smith and Stormzy have also thrown their hats in the ring, all expressing interest in playing for the newest royal couple.As Hereford-born Ellie Goulding, a friend of Harry\u0027s, sang at William and Kate\u0027s wedding, it is unlikely she will perform at Saturday\u0027s reception.:: Meghan Markle\u0027s Suits co-stars arrive for royal weddingSome veteran acts could also be entertaining the couple and their friends and family.Bruce Springsteen and Bryan Adams both played at the Invictus Games, which was where Harry and Meghan were seen together in public for the first time.In 2016 Coldplay also performed at an event for Harry\u0027s charity, Sentebale. Another question will be what Ms Markle will be wearing for the reception.Her wedding dress, which is rumoured to have cost \u0026#163100,000 - paid for by herself - was the star of the show, just as Kate\u0027s was in 2011.Like her future sister-in-law, she is expected to change into something which is a bit easier to dance in for the reception. As an actress on the red carpet she is used to wearing striking, and sometimes revealing, dresses, so she could well choose something similar for the party.Royal weddings have more British traditions than most, but Meghan is sure to bring some American traditions of her own - especially to the reception.They have already bucked the British tradition of a fruit cake by having a lemon and elderflower sponge, and may well have more dainties at the after-party. During cake-cutting ceremonies in the US, the newlyweds feed each other the first two slices of the cake - and often stuff the cake into each other\u0027s faces.The first dance in the UK takes place after the cake-cutting, but in the US, the couple usually have the first dance immediately after they are announced into the dining room.Meghan is likely to toss her bouquet into a crowd of single female guests, but whether Harry will follow the American tradition of lifting up the bride\u0027s gown to pull off a garter and fling it into a group of his friends remains to be seen. She previously said she would not have a maid or matron of honour as she could not pick between her good friends.However, as it is tradition in America for the chief bridesmaid to give a speech, either - or all - of her her best friends, Jessica Mulroney, Lindsay Roth and Misha Nonoo could give a speech.It is not known whether there is a noise curfew for Frogmore House, but because it is fairly secluded it is thought the party could go on into the early hours of Sunday. The Royal Family, including the newlyweds, will stay at Windsor Castle but the guests will leave from one of the estate\u0027s many exits - exits that photographers will not be allowed access to."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-wedding-markle_4314616.jpg?20180519120215 ","title":"royal wedding everything you need to know about meghans dress","story":"Meghan\u0027s veil was held in place by Queen Mary\u0027s diamond and platinum bandeau tiara, made in 1932 and lent by the Queen.The bling continued with a detachable brooch at its centre featuring 10 brilliant diamonds.The new Duchess of Sussex also wore a Cartier bracelet and earrings, and her shoes were based on a Givenchy design and made of silk duchess satin.Meghan\u0027s hair was styled by Serge Normant, while her friend Daniel Martin did her make-up.:: Meghan dress and its place in royal fashion history In tribute to Princess Diana, the bride\u0027s bouquet included forget-me-nots - her favourite.Harry also handpicked some flowers from the Kensington Place garden to add to the bouquet, which was designed by florist Philippa Craddock and tied with a silk ribbon.It also included scented sweet peas, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine and astrantia and myrtle.Despite rumours the dress would be made by Canadian designer Erdem Moralioglu, it was home-grown Clare Waight Keller, Givenchy\u0027s first female artistic director, who created it.But how does it compare to the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s dress?Kate\u0027s gown is believed to have cost about a quarter of a million pounds when she married Prince William in 2011.It was an Alexander McQueen design, padded at the hips, narrowed at the waist and with long Chantilly lace sleeves.The back featured 58 buttons, with a full skirt replicating the opening of a flower.She had a relatively short bridal train, just under 9ft (2.7m), and her ivory silk tulle veil featured hand-embroidered flowers around the edge.

The actor, who played Meghan\u0027s on-screen husband Mike Ross in the drama, previously posted a picture of Suits cast members seated around a table at a restaurant near to Windsor, where the bride-to-be will marry Prince Harry. The 36-year-old Canadian actor captioned the image: The last supper #royalwedding. And he later wrote: Going to bed now and thinking a lot about the strange surreal and wonderful day my friend Meghan is going to have tomorrow. Meghan - wherever you are - we are so grateful to be here to watch you both take this monumental step together. Love deeply and live well. He and his wife, Pretty Little Liars actress Troian Bellisario, were pictured at the Royal Standard of England pub in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, in a post on Instagram.  Two more Suits stars, Gabriel Macht, who plays Harvey Specter, and his wife Jacinda Barrett, who plays Zoey Lawford, have also been in the UK this week. And Sarah Rafferty, who plays Donna Paulsen in the series, appeared on American TV programme Today live from Windsor to talk about attending. She was joined on the programme by Rick Hoffman, who plays Louis Litt in the TV show, and Gina Torres, who plays Jessica Pearson. They told the Today hosts they were delighted to be able to attend the wedding of their friend and former colleague. Other former co-stars and friends of Meghan, including Abigail Spencer and Wendell Pierce, are rumoured to have been invited.

Joanna Frier, 53, reported the grim state of the women\u0027s loos in Horncastle, Lincolnshire, about five weeks ago.  She was so frustrated at the apparent lack of action that she wiped round the dirty sinks herself, reports the Manchester Evening News .  And she says that the toilets are still in a filthy state, with faeces on a toilet seat and around the bowl and litter on cubicle floors. Joanna said: I reported the problem about four or five weeks ago. I said the toilets were absolutely disgusting.  I asked for the council to spend four or five hours deep-cleaning the walls and tiles and they said they were sending their team in but two weeks later nothing had happened. I spoke to them again and still nothing happened. So a couple of weeks ago I cleaned the sinks myself with bathroom cleaner. I could run my fingernail through the grime. She added that the toilets were once again in a terrible state when she visited at about 3pm on Thursday, May 17.  Joanna said: Which cubicle do you use? The one with faeces on the toilet seat and in the pan, the one with the vodka bottle on the floor or the one with loo roll all over the floor? There\u0027s limescale on the worktops and grime on the tiles. Is this what we want visitors to see when they come to this lovely town? I want the council to do a deep clean once a fortnight and top it up every day. Several people have shared their thoughts about the toilets on Facebook.

Dozens of social media users each day have pointed out the similarity behind ginger Prince Harry and his late mum\u0027s one-time lover, Major James Hewitt. Mr Hewitt prefers to keep out of the public eye nowadays, but has spoken out twice in the past to categorically deny being the real father of Prince Harry. During a frank and candid television interview last year, he was asked directly if he was Harry\u0027s father. Hewitt replied: No, I\u0027m not.  Pressed over why the rumours have persisted for so long, he said: It sells papers. It\u0027s worse for him [Harry] probably, the poor chap.  Hewitt began a secret affair with Diana in 1986 - which was two years after Harry, now aged 32, was born. Despite this fact, gossip mongers have continued to speculate over who Harry\u0027s father really is, given the resemblance between red-haired Hewitt and the Prince. In 2002, Hewitt told the Sunday Mirror: There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry\u0027s father. I can absolutely assure you that I am not. Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine, and people say we look alike. I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time, I must state once and for all that I\u0027m not Harry\u0027s father. When I met Diana, he was already a toddler.  It is understood Prince Charles also reassured the young Harry that he was his biological father before he started school at Eton in 1998. Supporters of Diana, including her former butler Paul Burrell, have previously spoken out in a bid to quash the rumours. And Diana’s former police bodyguard Ken Wharfe, also denied the rumours, writing: “The malicious rumours that still persist about the paternity of Prince Harry used to anger Diana greatly. “The nonsense should be scotched here and now. Harry was born on 15 September, 1984. “Diana did not meet James until the summer of 1986, and the red hair, gossips so love to cite as proof is, of course, a Spencer trait.” Hewitt and Diana began seeing each other around the same time Prince Charles was said to have begun an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, now his second wife and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Hewitt defended his romance with the Princess, saying he could be forgiven for falling in love with her because it was so easy. Their affair was exposed five years after it started, shortly after Hewitt, a former tank commander, had served in the first Gulf War. Nowadays, the 59-year-old lives as a recluse in Dorset, but said he has no regrets about falling in love with the People\u0027s Princess. No, I don\u0027t regret that, he said last year I regret some of the things that have been caused by that but not that at all. No way.

The 36-year-old Duchess of Sussex is wearing a bespoke lily white high neck gown made of silk crepe, designed by Stella McCartney. She is also wearing shoes from Aquazurra made in silky satin, with nude mess and soles painted baby blue.  Her hair has been styled by George Northwood.   Party-loving Prince Harry has reportedly requested a Tiki-themed bar for the couple\u0027s wild carnival and festival-themed \u0027afterparty\u0027 at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle.   Guests will reportedly be welcomed by a steel band before feasting on South African wagyu beef and quaffing iced beers, champagne and ice luges filled with vodka, in a throwback to Mahiki - the groom\u0027s favourite London nightclub. Prince Charles will host the private evening for Harry and Meghan\u0027s inner circle. And he is expected to pick up the tab for the 200-strong party.  For the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Meghan wore an elegant, simple, pure white gown designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, with three quarter length sleeves and open bateau neckline. Meghan\u0027s delicate veil was five metres long and made from silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza. Two of her pageboys carried the ends as she made her way up the steps of the chapel to meet her prince.  Meghan\u0027s hair was styled in an up do and she wore the glittering Queen Mary\u0027s Diamond Bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen. Harry told his bride you look amazing, I missed you, to which Meghan replied thank you as they met at the altar. Guests were said to be moved to tears as the Prince of Wales and newly-married Harry gave speeches at a lunchtime reception in Windsor Castle\u0027s St George\u0027s Hall.  Harry was applauded as he referred to Meghan as his wife, just a short time after the couple were wed. The evening reception, hosted by the Prince of Wales, will be a private affair, allowing the guests to relax and celebrate with the happy couple. The closest friends of the newlywed will undoubtedly be among those in attendance. Frogmore House, a 17th century English country house, stands in the home park of Windsor Castle and is part of the Crown Estate. It is only open to individuals on three days of the year.

The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex beamed with delight as they emerged from the historic church set in the grounds of Windsor Castle. At the top of the vast West Steps, where the West Door was decorated with hundreds of cream and white flowers and green foliage, Harry, 33, and his bride stopped and locked lips to the delight of cheering onlookers. Moments before, Meghan whispered do we kiss now? to her new husband. The Queen\u0027s grandson and the American former actress, 36, who is now an HRH and a member of the British royal family, said their vows in front of 600 guests including the monarch and more than 30 royals, and were watched by a global television audience of millions. Meghan wore an elegant, simple, pure white gown designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, with three quarter length sleeves and open bateau neckline. Harry told his bride you look amazing, to which Meghan replied thank you as they met at the altar.  The couple tenderly held hands and exchanged smiles during the wedding ceremony. Meghan\u0027s delicate veil was five metres long and made from silk tulle, with a trim of hand-embroidered flowers in silk threads and organza, with two of her pageboys carrying the ends as she made her way up the steps. Her hair was styled in an up do and she wore the glittering Queen Mary\u0027s Diamond Bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen. The pair set off on an open-top carriage ride through the streets of Windsor where tens of thousands of well-wishers had descended on the town for the royal nuptials.  During the service, there were giggles when the Archbishop of Canterbury conducted the declarations. A loud and clear we will sounded out when the guests were asked if they would support Harry and Meghan. There were more laughs during the sermon made by preacher Michael Curry, the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church Bishop. He asked guests if any of them had travelled to the castle in a car, and then joked that he knew there were carriages around. Earlier, the outside crowd\u0027s cheer for the arrival of Harry and his best man William could be heard inside the chapel. Harry, looking dapper in his frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals, walked up towards the altar with his best man and was seen acknowledging a guest in the congregation with a nod.  Hollywood star George Clooney and his lawyer wife Amal Clooney, US talk show host Oprah Winfrey, British actor Idris Elba, tennis champion Serena Williams and Meghan\u0027s former cast mates from Suits were among the famous faces at the wedding. Other big names taking their seats were David and Victoria Beckham, and singer James Blunt. Former prime minister Sir John Major and his wife Dame Norma were also in attendance. Guests milled around before the service began, and David Beckham could be seen chatting to James Middleton, the brother of Kate - Duchess of Cambridge - in the chapel.  The Queen and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, sat in the same position on either side of the aisle with stellar views of the proceedings. The chapel was filled with white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves, with branches of beech, birch and hornbeam, carefully crafted by floral designer Philippa Craddock. The cascading hedgerow on the West Steps where Meghan arrived matched the glowing floral arch displays on the organ screen in the middle of the chapel - reflecting the surrounding Berkshire countryside. The groom, 33, smiled as his caught sight of his bride in her wedding dress for the first time. Meghan entered the chapel by herself before being met by the Prince of Wales. Prince Charles walked Meghan up the aisle instead of her father, Thomas Markle, who was unable to attend due to poor health. Best man Prince William supported his brother at the altar before Meghan arrived, chit-chatting between themselves as 600 guests patiently waited in their seats.  Just before Meghan arrived, the bridesmaids and pageboys were ushered in by the Duchess of Cambridge, who helped coax them into their positions with an encouraging hand on their shoulder. The children were handed flowers behind the door when one of the little bridesmaids began to cry. The Cambridges\u0027 nanny, Maria, lifted the child up to comfort her, as Prince George looked up at the tearful girl. George briefly chatted with his nanny, who helped to organise the group. Harry\u0027s niece and nephew - George and Princess Charlotte - were among the six bridesmaids and four pageboys, all aged between two and seven.  Harry\u0027s goddaughters Zalie Warren, two, and three-year-old Florence van Cutsem, Ms Markle\u0027s goddaughters, sisters Remi and Rylan Litt, aged six and seven respectively, and four-year-old Ivy Mulroney - the daughter of Meghan\u0027s close friend Jessica Mulroney - were bridesmaids. The other pageboys were Harry\u0027s six-year-old godson Jasper Dyer - the son of Harry\u0027s mentor Mark Dyer - and Mrs Mulroney\u0027s seven-year-old twin sons Brian and John Mulroney. A member of Prince Harry\u0027s household bent down to help to adjust one of the bridesmaid\u0027s dresses before their walk up the aisle.  When Meghan appeared through the doors of the chapel, sunlight streaming in behind her, she turned to smile and wave at the children who were standing to her right. Her sparkling tiara dazzled in the light of the chapel. The gaggle of children toddled up the aisle behind Meghan through the Nave, before the bride was joined by the Prince of Wales and the pair made their way down the aisle of the Quire to where Harry was waiting.  The siblings of Harry\u0027s late mother Diana, Princess of Wales were among the guests - Earl Spencer, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Lady Jane Fellowes, who gave a reading. The uplifting sounds of a gospel choir singing the moving soul classic Stand By Me, made famous by singer Ben E King but also sung by Beatle John Lennon, was a touching moment. The choir stood at the back of the chapel and guests all turned around in their seats to take in the scene.  Some guests wanted to clap at the end, but seemed unsure about whether it was appropriate. A few moments later, at 12.40pm, Harry and Meghan were proclaimed to be husband and wife. Cheers from the crowds outside prompted a laugh from the guests in the congregation, who could hear the excitement of people in the castle grounds. Meghan spent her last night as an unmarried woman with her mum Doria Ragland at Cliveden House, roughly 10 miles from Windsor Castle. Prince Harry stayed 15 miles away at Coworth Park with William. Harry and Meghan announced their engagement to a flurry of excitement in November 2017, just days after Harry had popped the question over roast chicken.

The new Duchess of Sussex opted out of obeying her husband, and walked herself halfway down the aisle after what\u0027s been a tumultuous week. She also showed tremendous poise and grit in the face of a teen-tiny gatecrasher. In a blink-and-you-miss it moment, Meghan didn\u0027t so much as flinch when a blue bottle smacked her in the face during Bishop Michael Curry\u0027s lively sermon. A pretty big fly, at that.  Keeping her cool, she simply wrinkled her nose and gently shook her head to make the annoying little critter go away. If that had been us, we would have been slightly less...dignified. Eagle-eyed viewers spotted the interloper, and were quick to heap praise on Meghan for her composure.

Heidi Robinson was scarred for life by Chantelle Hayes in 2016, but is refusing to let her injuries knock her confidence as she prepares to compete in Miss British Isles. The 39-year-old\u0027s injuries still cover her face, but she is determined to put it all behind her and will cover her injuries with make-up.  Heidi told the Liverpool Echo : “I’ve gone for everything this year that I never would have before what happened.   It made me a lot less scared to go for things. I didn’t have much confidence anyway because of my age and I don’t think I’m very ‘model’. I think I’m more of an actress. I’ve still got the scars, I just have to cover them up with make-up. “One’s on the side of my face so the way my hair falls I can cover it and the other one is in the middle of my head. “I’m still the same person with scars or without.  The competition requires contestants to model in a ball gown, cocktail dress and strip down to their swim wear for the bikini round - but despite the attack knocking her confidence, Heidi said she’s ready to take on the challenge. She said: “I’ve done fitness classes and stuff and I’m used to performing. I know I will be nervous.” The mother-of-one, from the Wirral, said she hopes her story will inspire others. She added: “If anyone is feeling bad about something that has happened to them, like what happened to me, or if they have been in a violent relationship then look how it can change, you know?  “Things have changed so much for me, if you take those steps to protect yourself and to stay positive and just take baby steps.” Despite coming out of a ‘volatile’ relationship with Hayes, Heidi says she’s hopeful she will be able to find love again in the future. She said: “Don’t get me wrong, it was a lot of worse than just a scar - I’ve gone through real hell and back - but I’ve not really spoken about it to many people.  “It affected my mental health and it still does now. It has really been a bad two years of my life, but I loved here, I loved her to bits.  “Now it’s turned around and I’ve come through it.

Karen Land was on the brink of death when she was given just months to live in December - but has defied all odds and is now cancer free. The mother-of-five was so unwell that she could barely climb a flight of stairs, breathe or talk without struggling. But the community came together to raise money for lifesaving immunotherapy, and combined with Karen\u0027s fighting spirit, their efforts paid off.  Scans taken on May 16 showed the disease has disappeared and there is no evidence of any cancer anywhere.    She told Lincolnshire Live: It\u0027s the best news I could have hoped for. I am now officially in remission.  I feel a bit like a walking miracle considering I was supposed to be dead by now. My consultant has said that I am one of a few people that just respond really well to treatment. She now has three weeks of radiotherapy to endure and will need a scan every three months, and there could still be a chance she will relapse in the next 12 months. Her dream job was in her grasp after she completed her firefighter training course until the terrible diagnosis came through.  She thought she would never have the chance to put her new found skills to the test in real life as a result. But that could now all change. The second best news I had was when I asked the doctor if I could return to work, she said. He said it’s not a unrealistic expectation. I’ve just got the radiotherapy to complete and a bit of work on my fitness to do. I already have a appointment to see occupational health next week so I am hoping in the next two months I can get back. Karen has even stopped donations coming into her Just Giving page. I’ve decided to end my Just Giving page for the time being and if the time comes in the future where I need treatment again or immunotherapy I will look at starting it up again, she said. She will start oxygen therapy but will use the donations or reopen the page if she needs immunotherapy in the future. Karen also spoke about the nightmarish eight months she and her family endured. Being told I had months left to live in December was the most traumatic thing I’ve ever experienced, she said. I actually got to the stage where my body was just overrun with cancer I couldn’t breath, talk and even climbing a flight of stairs was a massive task.

The mouth-watering three-tier cake is thought to have been too heavy to stack the sections on top of each other. Instead the three separate tiers are resting on ornate golden goblets. The cake is being cut at the wedding reception and will be served to guests at the couple\u0027s reception. The reception is being given by the Queen at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle, with about 600 guests invited.  Approximately 7,500 items of food have been prepared by a team of 25 chefs, led by royal chef Mark Flanagan. Designed by Claire Ptak, the wedding cake features elderflower syrup made at The Queen’s residence in Sandringham from the estate’s own elderflower trees, as well as a light sponge cake uniquely formulated for the couple. A filling made from Amalfi lemon curd and elderflower buttercream tied all the elements together. The cake was decorated with Swiss meringue buttercream and 150 fresh flowers, mainly British and in season, including peonies and roses.  Ms Ptak has been assisted by a team of six other bakers, including Violet Bakery head baker Izaak Adams. The cake has been made from 200 Amalfi lemons, 10 bottles of Sandringham elderflower cordial, 20kg of butter, 20kg of sugar and 500 organic eggs from Suffolk. The inside consists of layered lemon sponge that’s been drizzled with an elderflower syrup and sandwiched using buttercream and lemon curd, while the outside has been decorated using a white buttercream made from elderflower Swiss meringue. Prince Harry and Markle have been heavily involved in the culinary process, with the lemon sponge made especially for the couple and the elderflower cordial made from elderflowers sourced from the Queen’s Sandringham estate.  “The elderflower is so quintessentially British to me as a Californian,” said Ms Ptak. “It’s a kind of ethereal, floral flavour which I think is very special, especially for a wedding.” The final appearance of the cake and its display has been kept secret until the day of the nuptials. “It’s an installation of the way that we’re putting it out. It’s the last thing that we’ll reveal, said Ms Ptak.  “It’s a non-traditional layout,” Ms Ptak continued. “It’s a slight shift from tradition.” The baker says Prince Harry and Markle - now the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - particularly like the ingenuity behind the cake’s spring design, praising its “seasonality” and “freshness”. “The buttercream is sweet and the lemon curd is very tart so you get a very lovely thing happening when you take a bite, which is to get all of these flavours and sensations perfectly balanced,” Ms Ptak explained. The cake has been decorated with a variety of flowers, including some of Markle’s personal favourites in shades of white and cream.

She arrived as her parents Carole and Michael entered the chapel alongside celebrities from around the world. The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s sister is reportedly due to give birth sometime in October. Today she wore a green and lilac dress and floral fascinator alongside husband James Matthews. The dress was a \u0026pound495 creation by The Fold. It was a similar colour to that worn by her mother. Pippa was earlier spotted leaving Kensington in west London earlier this morning for the journey west.  It was reported last week the 34-year-old, who married James Matthews in her own May wedding last year, has been left off the invite list for the wedding reception, which will take place after the ceremony. Insiders say Harry\u0027s ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy will also miss out on the evening soiree at Frogmore House. Instead, both she and Pippa will be sent home after the formal nuptials take place in Windsor Castle.  Last month it was reported Pippa Middleton and her husband, financier James Matthews, are expecting there first child together. The couple shared the news with friends and family members, including Middleton’s big sister Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, according to reports. The couple exchanged vows back in May 2017 at a lavish ceremony at St Mark\u0027s Church, in London, attended by about 150 guests.  Before marrying, Pippa, a party-planning author, and Matthew dated briefly in 2012. A split resulted in Pippa going on to date Nico Jackson for about three years, but when that relationship ended, Middleton and Matthews officially reconnected.   The couple\u0027s baby news came one day before Kate Middleton gave birth to her third child with Prince William. Kensington Palace announced the arrival of Prince Louis on April 23.

The ginger prince is working a lot of facial hair at the moment, and many people wanted him to get rid of it all ahead of the big day. However the groom wasn\u0027t having any of it and decided to keep it as it is. People on social media have slammed his decision, saying he isn\u0027t allowed to have it while dressed in an Army uniform. But they\u0027re wrong.  As he is no longer a serving officer, Harry doesn\u0027t have to comply with the regulations. In a statement, Kensington Palace said: “Her Majesty The Queen gave her permission for Prince Harry to get married in his uniform.” It is understood that the permission covered the fact that Harry has a beard. Historian Hugo Vickers said the permission may also have been granted because Harry has retired from active service.  The beard also caused a big row in November when he wore a full beard with a uniform of a senior Blues and Royals officer uniform at the Remembrance Day service. British Army rules forbid all beards, except in a few rare circumstances, such as when a soldier is suffering from a skin complaint, or has strong religious reasons for retaining facial hair.          Sikhs are not allowed to cut their own hair, and can thus retain their beards while in uniform, for example. Special Forces or others on covert operations are also permitted to grow beards when behind enemy lines, but they would not wear them on parade. There is also a tradition that allows a very small number of Pioneer Sergeants to wear a beard when on official duty, but members of the Queen’s personal guard have never been allowed to do so    The Queen , Harry’s grandmother, is Colonel-in-Chief of the Blues and Royals, while the Colonel of the Regiment is Princess Anne, his aunt. It is one of the two cavalry regiments of the Household Cavalry – the other is the Life Guards – and can trace its history back to Oliver Cromwell’s New Model Army of the 17th Century. Throughout the centuries, officers have been known for their clean-cut appearances, although some occasionally grew moustaches and connected side-whiskers, especially when serving in Muslim countries. The Royal Navy – in which Harry ’s father, Prince Charles, served – has always been allowed beards, but officers are told to shave them off it they are not full enough.

In the same way Prince William and Kate Middleton were given a royal dukedom on their wedding morning, Harry and Meghan have been given a similar honour. Their title means the new form of address for both is Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The Queen has also conferred a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. As when Kate Middleton got married, Meghan does officially become a princess today - but not in her own right. She will be HRH Princess Henry of Wales.   An official statement from Kensington Palace read: The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. Prince Harry thus becomes His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, and Ms. Meghan Markle on marriage will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.  There has never previously been a Duchess of Sussex. The first Duke of Sussex was an eccentric son of King George III and his two marriages were deemed illegal. Prince Augustus Frederick was born in 1773 and died 1843 - and lived in Kensington Palace, which is also Meghan and Harry\u0027s home. Augustus was sent abroad and married Lady Augusta Murray - whom he called Goosy - in secret in Rome in 1793. But the marriage was declared void by George III, who had not given his approval. It was later annulled on the grounds that it contravened the Royal Marriages Act 1772. The prince became the Duke of Sussex in 1801. But Lady Augusta, from whom he separated the same year, did not become the Duchess of Sussex. She called herself princess and demanded a peerage, but never received one. Earl of Dumbarton is a title that has strong military connections. The first to hold the title was George Douglas, a younger son of the first Marquess of Douglas, who was created Earl of Dumbarton in 1675.  A Scottish nobleman and soldier, George was given the title by Charles II in recognition of his military service. When James VII of Scots (James II of England) came to the throne in 1685, the earl was made military commander in Scotland, and it is thought that when the King was deposed, George accompanied him to his court in exile in France.  On George\u0027s death at St German-en-Laye in France, the title passed to his son, also called George, who became the second Earl of Dumbarton. The title became extinct when the second earl died in 1749, meaning it has not been used in more than 260 years. It means that Prince Harry becomes the third to hold the Scottish title, and on marriage, Meghan will become Countess of Dumbarton. Dumbarton is on the north bank of the River Clyde, to the west of Glasgow.

Will she or won\u0027t she? To promise to obey in the vows shows tradition, humility, that a bride will submit to her husband and at no point bother herself with either a dictionary or a lawyer. To omit the word indicates that dread word feminism, the even-more dread word feisty, and also regular rows which, frankly, are in every marriage regardless of who said what. So brace yourselves, tomorrow, to hear Nicholas Witchell\u0027s opinion that was to be expected, Meghan is a very different kind of Royal, but Diana never promised to obey Charles and we all know how THAT ended, don\u0027t we Huw.  It seems like every day we await the Royal wedding is another episode of the Markle Debacle, in which things do not run according to what you\u0027d expect the palace\u0027s plans to be, and therefore a little more like a normal wedding peppered with infighting, drinking and outcast relatives. The latest mismanaged news is that the bride\u0027s father, who was going to walk her down the aisle then decided he was too embarrassing then said he would and then said he was too ill and now appears to be in hospital, is not going to do it after all. Prince Charles is going to do it instead, perhaps because if there is any role he feels comfortable in it is that of an historical anachronism. But for reasons that no-one can quite fathom he\u0027s only going to walk her halfway, with the bride abandoning her mother a the door of the church and doing the first 100 yards on her own and Chuck picking her up halfway, like a last-minute pint of milk. There are three reasons for all the confusion: the Markles all seem to hate each other, the Windsors hate each other as well as everyone else, and Meghan Markle is an independent, feminist, career woman marrying into a family where she cannot be any of those things. Of COURSE the wedding is a mess.  But therein lies any marriage\u0027s biggest risk: change. It\u0027s something that\u0027s inevitable over the course of a lifetime but most of us are resistant when asked to do it in a day. When the change is moving house, a joint bank account, or parenthood it\u0027s bad enough - imagine changing every single thing about yourself, in order to join a family that refuses, under any circumstances, to change. The Meghan we were introduced to after news broke of her romance with Harry was fun. An early starter marriage, some handsome ex-boyfriends, a role in a plot-free legal drama and social media accounts that made her accessible. We saw pictures of her drinking wine, cuddling her dogs, hanging out with celebrity friends in celebrity haunts doing celebrity things. Actual photographs of her with her father, which now seems like the last we\u0027ll ever see of THAT . Meghan the charity campaigner, Meghan the Trump-loather, Meghan who smiled because she had a nice life. And as soon as Harry and her were an item it stopped. Social media accounts were closed, all socialising was done behind closed doors, the acting and endorsements ended and one of her dogs was even abandoned with friends in Canada. She\u0027s had two trips to the supermarket nearest Kensington Palace and soon stopped doing that when she was photographed picking up a loaf of bread. Some change on the part of any Royal in-law is obviously necessary - learning protocol, lowering the hemlines, being camera-ready. But what, exactly, is Harry changing in return?  Well, presumably strip billiards, racist videos and swastika parties are now off the table. But they had been put behind him anyway, so don\u0027t really count. There have been reports he\u0027s started drinking green smoothies and going to the gym, but anyone will tell you that won\u0027t last. And there is nothing else - not one single thing - that will change for Harry as a result of being married. Yes, he\u0027ll get a wife. Maybe children. But the richer, for poorer part of the vows will forever be a private joke, his work-life balance will stay the same and the chances are he\u0027ll still be shooting birds at Sandringham on Boxing Day until, and perhaps even beyond, the point he\u0027s in a wheelchair. Meghan will learn to bow and scrape, to curtsey and hide, speak through others rather than for herself and to not put on a single ounce in weight. Harry will not learn how to deal with her family, as even now they\u0027re almost all being kept locked outside the palace gates. There is no indication he\u0027ll ever meet her father, as news of it would be on a showbiz website before the text message finished its ping. His brother William managed to blend two families together when he married. Granted, the Markles are more likely than the Middletons to steal the spoons and trip over a corgi, but the entire point of marriage is taking the rough with the smooth.  It\u0027s normal to sacrifice things when you marry. Most of us are lucky if we can limit it to sanity. But Meghan seems to have sacrificed almost everything about what and who she is, while her husband has sacrificed... biscuits? The second slice of cake? How every noble of him. Meghan could, and may still be, a modernising and humanising influence on the monarchy. Much will be made of her being able to squeeze Ben E. King and Etta James songs into the wedding music. But all her independence seems, on marriage to the Royals, have been boiled down to two songs off the iPod and some finger food. Of all that we know about Meghan before marriage - AM, if you like - that is all that remains. Meghan post-marriage may still have political opinions but is forbidden from uttering them, will still have relatives but never again speak to most of them, and when we see her smile it will be because she\u0027s on camera, and not necessarily because she\u0027s enjoying herself. Yesterday she drove to her wedding rehearsal in \u0026pound7,000 diamond earrings, and how many of those would it take for YOU to be happy as the junior partner in YOUR marriage?

Curry, the first black head of the Episcopal Church in the United States, started by quoting civil rights hero Dr Martin Luther King and powered on citing spirituals, medieval poetry and the experiences of slaves in the American south. We\u0027re going to sit down, we gotta get y\u0027all married! he told Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and their wedding guests. By the end, he was referring to Harry and Meghan as my brother, my sister, and telling them God love you, God bless you Later he said: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up.  Meghan smiled throughout as Harry looked on intently. At the end of the sermon, Harry Harry had just one word to say. He turned to Meghan to his left and simply said: Wow. Harry\u0027s brother Prince William could be seen on TV smiling during the lengthy address. Some commentators took to Twitter to point out the facial reactions in the chapel to the Bishop\u0027s sermon. In particular, a close-up of the Queen\u0027s granddaughter, Zara, with her mouth open became a focus for social media. Meanwhile Harry\u0027s cousin Princess Beatrice was spotted giggling.  As the bishop got into full swing, Sky News journalist Mark Austin said: Lovely moment as the preacher takes the Royals to the edge of their comfort zone  BBC presenter Jeremy Vine said: The preacher is doing 50 in a 30 zone and it\u0027s brilliant. Bishop Curry, 65, is the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church. Bishop Curry is based in Raleigh, North Carolina, - but today he went global. Giving an address titled the Power of Love at the service, the Chicago native opened his energetic speech with the words of Martin Luther King, a devout Christian whose faith shaped his struggle against racial injustice in the US, hailing his views on love as right. We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way, Bishop Curry quoted.      US ABC News anchor T.J. Holmes said: I\u0027m from West Memphis ... and my wedding wasn\u0027t even this black. I\u0027ve learned in my life that anytime a black pastor says I\u0027m wrapping up ... you should get comfortable. But take your time, Mr. Curry. I\u0027m loving this. Radio 1 DJ Matt Edmondson said: SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN HIS OWN TV SHOW IMMEDIATELY.  Pop star Danni Minogue said: Windsor is waiting. Piers Morgan tweeted: OK, Rev... you need to wrap. One royal reporter noted: This is brilliant from Bishop Curry - some amazing facial expressions all around! Ed Miliband tweeted: Rev Michael Curry could almost make me a believer.      Princess Beatrice and Eugenie were both also seen smiling. There were more laughs when he asked guests if any of them had travelled to the castle in a car, and then joked that he knew there were carriages around. The Mirror reported last week how Bishop Curry is to march on the White House against Donald Trump four days after the wedding today. Bishop Curry will join a Washington protest over what he calls the president’s “dangerous” leadership.     The first African-American to be primate of the Episcopal Church – a US offshoot of the Church of England – he has branded Trump’s America First policy “a theological heresy for the followers of Christ”. And the Most Rev Bishop Curry has also previously blasted a “crisis of moral and political leadership at the highest levels of our government”.     His invitation came months after the Royal Family confirmed Mr Trump would not be invited to the wedding. Described as a stunning preacher by Archbishop Justin Welby the 65-year-old certainly grabs your attention. The bishop, from Chicago, has previously backed gay marriage and transgender rights. In his autobiography he revealed his parents were descended from slaves and sharecroppers.   He was ordained as a deacon in June 1978. He became the first black presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in 2015. The Episcopal bishop\u0027s role in the service today was seen as a nod to the actress\u0027s US roots as she married into the British royal family.  Meghan was born in Los Angeles, California, to an African-American mother and was baptised into the Anglican Church ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry. The Episcopal Church is the US offshoot of the Church of England and forms part of the broader Anglican Communion. The bishop\u0027s words rose in a passionate crescendo as he spoke of the link between love and the divine, his style a stark contrast to the sober delivery of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was officiating.For the royal family, the animated performance would be a departure from the type of sermons they normally see at church services.  The wide-ranging address cited love as the key to curing global problems such as poverty. Love can help and heal when nothing else can. There\u0027s power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will. Such power could be seen in the service, he continued, saying: Two young people fell in love and we all showed up. In a moment of light self-deprecation, Bishop Curry noted he had to soon sit down, gesturing to the couple and adding we need to get y\u0027all married. The ideas of French thinker Pierre Teilhard de Chardin were called upon as the bishop brought his address to a powerful conclusion.

Honestly, you lot... It all began seriously enough. The celebs arrived, then the royals began to filter in, then we had the groom, best man and, finally, Meghan making a breathtaking entrance in her stunning Givenchy gown. So far, so royal wedding . Surprisingly, it was the vicar who prompted the smirks - and even got Victoria Beckham to finally crack a smile. Buy the man a beer!    During the first 30 seconds of the opening prayers, archbishop Justin Welby made reference to Harry and Meghan\u0027s sexual union. Specifically, the delight \u0026amp tenderness of sexual union.  And EVERYONE picked up on it.          But there\u0027s a perfectly simple explanation for the vicar\u0027s words. This is a royal wedding after all. The inclusion of the words sexual union is all part and parcel of a Church of England wedding ceremony ans features in the preface (or opening prayers).      The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are [born and] nurtured and in which each member of the family,in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love.

Little Remi and Rylan Litt were among a group of adorable children who walked behind the couple after they tied the knot at Windsor Castle. The sisters, aged six and seven, clutched bouquets of flowers as they followed the newlyweds, with Ivy Mulroney, four, in between them. But as the cameras focused on them, one of the pair appeared to have words with her sibling - before poking her twice with her bouquet. The youngster was filmed leaning over beaming Ivy before tapping her sister\u0027s upper arm with the flowers in the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel.  Footage of the moment has since been shared on social media, with one amused viewer commenting: She was telling off her sister. Remi and Rylan are the daughters of Meghan\u0027s close pal, Benita Litt. The former actress herself is their godmother and, in a now-deleted Instagram post, she referred to the girls as her favourites. The youngsters\u0027 mum Benita runs her own brand agency under her name where she helps others to start their businesses. She formerly worked as an intellectual property and entertainment attorney in California, US.  Meanwhile, the pair\u0027s dad Darren - Benita\u0027s husband - is an experienced investor and entrepreneur, according to his LinkedIn profile. Remi and Rylan were among six flower girls at this afternoon\u0027s ceremony. They were joined by Ivy, three-year-old Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, also three, and Zalie Warren, who is just two. Harry and Meghan\u0027s page boys were Prince George, four, Jasper Dyer, six, and Ivy\u0027s seven-year-old twin brothers, Brian and John Mulroney. The wedding, which blended ancient English ritual with African American culture, was watched by a global TV audience of millions.  Meghan, dressed in a veil, diamond tiara and a sleek dress with a long train, was accompanied up the aisle by Harry\u0027s dad, Prince Charles. She and her groom then exchanged vows and were proclaimed husband and wife, before sharing a kiss outside, on the chapel\u0027s steps. Newly styled the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the beaming couple then sat in the horse-drawn coach for a tour of Windsor, Berkshire. They were cheered by a sea of well-wishers along every inch of the route. The local authority said just over 100,000 people were in Windsor for the occasion, which unfolded under clear, blue skies.  While typical of royal weddings in some ways, the ceremony also broke with tradition, particularly when American bishop Michael Bruce Curry delivered a passionate sermon that was a far cry from the sober tones of the Church of England. There\u0027s power in love, he boomed at the congregation, which included the Queen, senior royals and celebrities ranging from Oprah Winfrey to Elton John, George Clooney and David Beckham. Do not underestimate it. Anyone who has ever fallen in love knows what I mean, he added, in an energetic address that quoted Martin Luther King.

As Meghan Markle met her prince at the altar, cameras showed Prince Charles, Camilla and Kate looking up at the happy couple. And in front of the Queen - next to Harry\u0027s big brother - was an empty spot. Royal fans said the sentimental move left them tearful and thinking of the late princess. There was also speculation the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did the same at their wedding in 2011. But according to Buckingham Palace sources, the spot in front of the Queen is always left empty.  If it\u0027s true, what a lovely idea, one person wrote on Twitter. Di will be looking down at her son feeling nothing but pride. I can\u0027t stop crying, another wrote. Such a moving day already - and now this. Harry and Meghan also had a floral tribute to Princess Diana at the wedding.    St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, was adorned with floral displays of foliage, white peonies, white garden roses and other white blooms, which towered above the seats. White garden flowers were a favourite of Harry\u0027s late mum. And forget-me-nots, another favourite, were used in the bridal bouquet.      Sir Elton John also performed at Harry and Meghan\u0027s lunchtime wedding reception. The singer has a close relationship with Harry and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, and was friends with the Princess of Wales. In 1997, he famously sang a re-worked version of his hit Candle In The Wind at the princess\u0027s funeral, changing the words to Goodbye England\u0027s Rose.    In a TV interview in June, 2008, he told how singing at the funeral was a surreal experience. He said: What was going through my mind was, \u0027Don\u0027t f*** this up. Don\u0027t sing a wrong note. Don\u0027t sing the wrong note. Be stoic. Don\u0027t break down and just do it to the best you can possibly do it without showing any emotion whatsoever\u0027.  The singer was also present at William\u0027s wedding to the Duchess of Cambridge in 2011. Meghan and Harry sealed their love with a kiss after being declared husband and wife this afternoon. The bride arrived at church in a wedding dress designed by Clare Waight Keller , which was set off by a veil made to represent all 53 countries of the Commonwealth. Harry arrived at St George\u0027s chapel at Windsor Castle a short while before Meghan alongside best man Prince William.  The couple kissed after the ceremony finished before getting into a royal horse-drawn carriage for a 30-minute procession as thousands of fans lined the streets . They are now back inside Windsor Castle for a reception where Meghan, Harry and Prince Charles will all make speeches. Global superstars including Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, David Beckham and George Clooney were there to watch the wedding, as well as the Queen and Prince Philip. The couple were this morning made the Duke and Duchess of Sussex by the Queen in a wedding day honour.

Meghan quickly composed herself before emerging into the sunlight with Prince Harry on her arm. The bride wore a simple, pure white gown designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, with three quarter length sleeves and open bateau neckline.  Harry told his bride You look amazing. I missed you when she met him at the altar. After the service, they kissed in front of a delighted crowd. The couple tenderly held hands and exchanged smiles during the wedding ceremony. Meghan\u0027s hair was styled in an up do and she wore the glittering Queen Mary\u0027s Diamond Bandeau tiara, loaned to her by the Queen. It was described as one of life\u0027s great moments as guests watched Prince Harry tie the knot with Meghan today. But it was not without its hiccups.    The excitement of the royal wedding became too much for one bridesmaid, who started crying moments before Meghan entered the chapel. The occasion seemed to overwhelm one of the little girls, believed to be the youngest, Zalie Warren. The two-year-old had to be picked up and comforted by Prince George and Princess Charlotte\u0027s nanny before she made her way into the church.

They will be known as Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex , the Earl and Countess of Dumbarton and Baron and Baroness Kilkeel - catchy.  The Baroness Kilkeel is a brand new Irish title, but the other two have been used before. Prince Harry is only the second Duke of Sussex and the original was Prince Augustus Frederick. Born in 1773, Prince Augustus was university educated and campaigned for the abolition of slavery.  But he had a very difficult love life. Like Harry, he didn\u0027t marry for titles or rank but for love. He married twice, but his father George III didn\u0027t approve of either and ruled they were unlawful. He married his first wife Lady Augusta Murray in 1793 in Rome but his dad ruled it void using the Royal Marriages Act. This meant the couple\u0027s two children Augustus and Augusta were not considered heirs to his title.  They separated in 1801. Prince Augustus then married Lady Cecilia Letitia Buggin in 1831, but his father did exactly the same thing.  This means Meghan Markle will officially be the first Duchess of Sussex.  Harry and Meghan will tie the knot at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle today. After the ceremony they will take a carriage ride around the town before heading back to the castle for two receptions.  Follow our live blog for all the details from the happy day.

The obvious strength of their love for each other will delight hundreds of millions of TV viewers around the globe. Everyone of goodwill will hope the sun shines today on two decent, fun people who look as if they were made for each other. Their beaming smiles say it all and this passionate pair pack a tremendous potential to be a force for good everywhere.

We wish them every \u0026shyhappiness.  Tory chancer Theresa May exploiting the royal wedding as a good day to bury bad news is the clumsy opportunism of a \u0026shyPrime Minister who has proved skilled at only one thing... tripping herself up. Slipping out the names of a bus-load full of new unelected peers under cover of the Windsor celebrations was crass even by the standards of this political bumbler. Stuffing jobs-for-life cronies into a House of Lords inflicting Brexit defeats on the \u0026shyGovernment isn’t democratic. Let’s hope May doesn’t now add insult to injury by trying to slash the number of MPs to reinforce an unfair electoral advantage in favour of the Conservatives. If she does there will be the mother of all backlashes. Treating Parliament, and the public, with contempt to get you own way is unworthy behaviour... not that she’d know it.  Odds and sods What a coincidence, a Tory MP defending fixed-odds betting terminals earning the gambling industry a fortune is a regular passenger on the bookies’ gravy train. The odds on angry Shipley lip Philip Davies ever saying anything sensible to the Daily Mirror just got a lot longer.

Merryn Crofts, 21, weighed less than six stone and spent the last three years of her life totally bed-bound with severe ME - an incurable condition that affects 250,000 people in the UK. The youngster was unable to take more than two teaspoons of food before suffering immense gut pain and vomiting, a coroner was told. Merryn, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester. today became only the second person in the UK to have ME - myalgic encephalomyelitis - listed on a death certificate. Despite being classed as a real neurological disease, many think the condition is not real - some even within the medical profession. Merryn\u0027s mum, Clare Norton, sobbed as she told Rochdale Coroner\u0027s Court how her beautiful and energetic daughter was left wheelchair-bound and reliant on tube feeding.  She said: As a child, she was a bundle of energy. She didn\u0027t walk anywhere - she would hop, skip and jump. She was the kind of person that people gravitated towards. They wanted to be her friend. She was very social and loved drama. She was a total fashionista, a typical teenager. Her bedroom was a mess of clothes, hairspray and tan. But she was also stubborn and I think that helped her cope with her illness in a lot of ways. She never gave up. In August 2011, Merryn, then 15, was diagnosed with hives and swelling shortly after coming back from a family holiday in Mallorca. Tests in early 2012 revealed that at some point she had contracted glandular fever - a virus which can trigger ME. Despite dozens of medical appointments - including mental health checks for panic attacks - Merryn\u0027s condition deteriorated as she suffered breathing problems, exhaustion and excruciating hypersensitivity to touch, light and sound. She was eventually diagnosed with ME in the summer of 2012. The would-be theatre star, who was forced to wear an eye mask, also suffered from severe migraines, brain fog, slurred speech and persistent infections. Stomach problems, and problems swallowing, meant that her weight plummeted to just five-and-a-half stone.  Coroner Katherine McKenna was told that Merryn could take on just 100 calories a day because her gut was in so much pain, and that, by 2015, even two teaspoons of nutrients were intolerable. Merryn was eventually fitted with an intravenous nutrition line but suffered intestinal failure and was given a terminal diagnosis in 2016.. She died on May 23, 2017, just days after her 21st birthday. Mrs McKenna today concluded her cause of death as starvation caused by a withdrawal of supportive nutriition, caused by ME. She described Merryn as someone who bore her suffering with dignity and good grace. She said: Merryn had suffered with ME since 2012 which caused severe fatigue, gastointestinal failure, chronic pain, global hypersensitivity, loss of mobility and function. Despite extensive investigations no reason for her gastrointestinal failure which led to her reliance on supportive nutriton was found and it most likely it was caused by her ME. Mum Clare, who attended the inquest with daughter Amy Williams and Merryn\u0027s stepdad Dave Norton, told of her long-standing belief that ME contributed to her death. She said: With ME the key symptom is post-exertional malaise. That means if someone\u0027s energy is pushed beyond what they can tolerate, it will trigger all of their symptoms. The best advice we were given was for Merryn to do just 50% of what she felt capable of. But Merryn didn\u0027t even have 50% to give. She was always crashing, so everything that happened to her kept pushing her further behind.  Pathologist Daniel DuPlessis said that a post-mortem showed low-grade inflammation of nerve roots. It was suggested that this inflammation could have made her bowel hypersensitive to processing nutrients. Dr DuPlessis pointed out that Merryn had inflammation of the ganglia - gatekeepers to sensations in the brain. A post-mortem into the only other UK death attributed to ME, Sophia Mirza, 32, in 2006, also found ganglionitis. ME expert at Salford Royal hospital, Dr Annice Mukherjee, said she was convinced that the illness was responsible for triggering Merryn\u0027s intestinal failure. She said: I haven\u0027t come across a case of ME with life-threatening malnutrition before but I have come across many patients with severe ME that are bedbound that have global sensitivity issues and severe gut issues. But every single patient with ME is different, so I never see the same case twice. The ME Association is at the forefront of improving access to care, treatment and research and removing the disease\u0027s stigma. The charity today called for Merryn\u0027s death not to be in vain. A spokesman said: Firstly, the sympathies of the ME Association are with Merryn’s family today. We hope the result of this inquest provides some closure and allows them to cherish their memories of Merryn. It is essential that Merryn\u0027s untimely death is not overlooked and the urgent need for proper recognition of, and research into, ME is recognised. In our present state of knowledge, we don\u0027t know if ME can kill directly, but there are various consequences of having the illness that can increase the risk of early death. What we do know is this: ME is real. It’s devastating. It leaves people, at best, struggling to work. At worst, it leaves them enduring a tortuous existence, a living death, where they are unable to take their place in society.  One in four are so severely affected that they are housebound, bedbound, and in some cases unable to shower, clothe, or feed themselves. People are taking their lives because they cannot bear the torture this illness brings. Others describe themselves as rotting behind closed curtains. Despite being recognised as a neurological disease, many doctors still don’t know how to diagnose and manage ME/CFS and lack or research means that we still don’t have any effective forms of treatment. This is a completely unacceptable situation for a disease costing the UK economy around \u0026pound3.5billion in lost taxes, healthcare and benefit costs. There is no cure - and the longer it will take to find one unless funding dramatically increases. How many more people have to suffer before ME merits properly funded medical research? Merryn, who loved acting, had dreams of attending a performing arts school in Liverpool and adored musical theatre like Billy Elliott and Wicked. Mental health expert, Dr Ross Overshott, told the inquest that Merryn did not suffer a psychological illness, such as depression or an eating disorder. He said: She was hopeful for the future, she could speak in a very involved way about her hobbies and interests, particularly musicals and films. Before she died, Merryn revealed that she wanted her brain and spinal column to be donated to ME research. They were donated to the ME Association\u0027s Ramsay Research Fund, which conducts research into the causes of the disease.

His lifeless body was found hanged in his room on September 17, 2001, alongside a note that read: “Suicide. The unknown man, described as tall and dark, had checked using an assumed name and left few identifying clues.  An envelope stuffed with with $160 (\u0026pound118) of cash was also found with a message indicating the money was “for the room.” Media coverage of his death speculated possible links to the 9/11 hijackers, due in part to his ‘Middle Eastern’ appearance. The unusual cold case has be central to numerous online conspiracy theories for over a decade. Some speculated that the “John Doe” was part of a team of 19 hijackers whose suicide attacks on New York\u0027s Twin Towers claimed the lives of 3,000 people.  Some thought that he could be a spy or a cult member – as DNA traces initially failed to determine his identity. Those theories have now proved to be false thanks to painstaking forensic work by the non-profit DNA Doe Project organisation.  A team of 20 volunteers spent hundreds of hours running his DNA through a genealogy database in the hope they could discover close genetic matches. The team was eventually able to narrow down the location of his family to Almeda County, California.  “In the end, all the DNA matches and all the family trees and all the research paid off. This took persistence, good solid genealogy and detective work”, a Facebook post by the organisation said. Users of Redddit were instrumental in solving the case. 4,000 of their members scoured web groups in the hope that they would be able to trigger the memories of at least one person who could help. It was also those members who first notified DNA Doe Project about Stevik.  Sadly, the real name of Stevik will not be released to the public out of respect to the privacy of his grieving family. His relatives had assumed that he was still alive and had been avoiding them for decades until they were informed of his death. The dead man was also not from a Middle Eastern background but was in fact a mix of Hispanic and native American.

Mary Kinninmonth, director of Dundee’s Citizens Advice Bureau, said UC’s online system hampers less computer-literate claimants.She said: “The main things we see are people still having difficulty in making and managing online claims due to lack of confidence and/or knowledge of computer skills.“The helpline is also very difficult to get through to with long waiting times.“Even though the waiting time has reduced, there is still a waiting time – which will often mean people going into rent arrears.”Full service UC rolled out in Dundee in November, following a trial period for new single applicants.The number of Universal Credit issues dealt with by Dundee CAB has risen by almost 50% following the introduction of the full service.Dundee City Council gives UC claimants a reprieve over their arrears, acknowledging the delayed payouts the DWP makes from month to month.A spokesman for the authority said a £250,000 hardship fund for council tenants was created in April 2016, boosted to £450,000 for this year.He added: “We continue to do a considerable amount work to support tenants on Universal Credit.“If a tenant is having difficulties paying their rent a referral to the Council Advice Service is made. Staff there can offer help and assistance.”A spokeswoman for the DWP said claimants can receive advance payments if required from day one.She added: “We have removed the seven-day waiting period from new claims and pay people’s Housing Benefit for two weeks while they wait for their first full Universal Credit payment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/PA-28105789-843x564.jpg ","title":"dundee announce signing of french midfielder","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have announced the signing of a French midfielder.Elton Ngwatala has penned a deal at Dens Park and is Neil McCann\u0026#8217s first signing of the summer.The Dark Blues have snapped up the 24-year-old attacking player on a two-year deal despite interest from down south.Ngwatala previously played for Kidderminster Harriers in two spells at the National League North side.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0094a37a7-e1526475640876-928x564.jpg ","title":"dundee boss neil mccann admits hes made mistakes but looks to learn from them","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann says he had higher targets for his team this past season but insists an early start can get the Dark Blues where he wants them to be this time next year.A ninth-placed finish in the Premiership fell short of his stated top-half aim but Neil insists he learned a lot from his debut campaign as a manager.He said: “I think you have to self-analyse.“I’ve made mistakes, as a young manager I think that’s normal but, hopefully, if you’re learning from those it will put you in a better position next season.“In terms of going into the last five games, I learned a lot from my squad.“There was huge pressure going into the Hamilton game.“We knew it could have been a total role reversal and our goal difference was poorer so we knew the risk we were playing under but the players were brave and in it together.“That’ll help me 100% next season.

In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing.

They had used an orange survival bag over an old duvet, sticking their head in under the old fireplace for cover and placing their feet in a thermal shopping bag for warmth.”Gareth said that on Wednesday night the charity helped two women who needed medical attention.He added: “Our outreach patrol was kept busy that evening as we gave out lots of hot chocolate drinks, made two new street friends, issued two sleeping bags, cleansed and dressed one girl’s self-harming wounds on both her lower arms and transported another female street beggar to A\u0026ampE.”On May 12 Gareth said the team gave hot drinks to two homeless people who were sheltering in a church foyer.Five days earlier he helped a 47-year-old Jamaican man sleeping on a bench in Riverside Drive who was heading north.“We were able to supply him with a sleeping bag, hot drinks and advice and directed him to more suitable sheltered location,” he said.Gareth said that, the day before, he had spoken with three rough sleepers who told him they had been refused assistance from the authorities.Mike Cordiner, of the Eagles Wings Trust, said: “There seems to be a rise in the number of people coming to Dundee from other areas. I am aware of someone from Jamaica and a person from Poland currently sleeping rough in Dundee.“If you come from outwith the city the authorities do not find you somewhere to sleep.“This needs to change.”A council spokeswoman said: “We understand that being homeless is difficult and traumatic and our aim is to offer a service that is sympathetic as well as meeting our statutory duties.“When we are contacted the first thing that happens is an assessment interview within three working days, or if a person is ‘roofless’ they will be seen on the same day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9b7427711-e1526642317159-877x564.jpg ","title":"highly rated dundee youngsters mull over new deals","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have offered new contracts to youngsters Matty Henvey and Jesse Curran.Two stars in the club’s impressive Development side last season, Curran and Henvey have stepped up to the first team on multiple occasions over the past year and the Dee are keen to keep them.Both have shown they have something to offer the senior side in the future.Henvey demonstrated his goalscoring prowess in his fourth appearance for the top team, netting an important goal at Hamilton in a 2-1 victory.That strike also spelled the end of his season, however, as he was caught on the knee by Accies midfielder Darian MacKinnon, who hurt himself in the process.Curran, meanwhile, was a real stand-out for the U/20s all season as they finished second in the Development League.The Australian made eight appearances for the first team in the last campaign, very much impressing against Partick Thistle, in particular.Both have their current deals coming to an end this summer.Meanwhile, Dundee have been linked with a move for Partick Thistle left-back Callum Booth.The 26-year-old could be brought in to replace the departing Kevin Holt and Jon Aurtenetxe with the squad bare in the left full-back department.That all depends on whether Partick can keep themselves in the top flight with the former Hibs man free to leave if the club get relegated.n the club have sold 2,500 season tickets for the new campaign, a “huge increase on the same stage” last year, according to Dundee.The Early Bird Period is still running until June 9.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/douglas-community-centre-846x564.jpg ","title":"locals to benefits as dundee community centre gets six figure boost","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA six-figure boost has been given to a Dundee community centre.Douglas Community Centre Local Management Group secured a total of £108,540 in National Lottery funding after applying to Big Lottery Fund Scotland.The cash will be used to refurbish the cafe, creating a flexible space in which to host local events, community cafes and local interest groups.The project will benefit more than 500 people in Douglas, while also providing volunteering opportunities for 50 people.Dundee East MP Stewart Hosie said he would be writing to the management team to congratulate them on their success and to offer his continued support.He added: “This ambitious refurbishment will significantly improve the community centre’s already fantastic, and widely used, facilities.“I visit Douglas Community Centre regularly.‘‘I look forward to going back when the refurbishments are complete.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man donates garden benches in memory of partner to thank roxburghe house","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo garden benches and furniture have been donated to Roxburghe House.Walter Higgins, from Tealing, donated them in memory of his partner Gillian Jardine, who received treatment at Roxburghe before she died.Walter said: “I am very grateful for the loving care and attention Gillian received.

The police are never out of there,” she said.“Why are they creating a new community campus and putting this right smack bang in the middle?‘‘It’s disgraceful.”Tom Henney, who drew up a petition against the custody unit, said he wasn’t opposed to the SPS proposals.‘‘My opinion is still the same – nobody has any objection to what they’re trying to do but there are other areas better suited for this,” he said.“My biggest concern is if (offenders) get out.‘‘There are drugs, there is crime and it shouldn’t be here.”However, Ann Hutchison, 57, who lives two minutes from Our Lady’s, said she was “keeping an open mind” on the plans.She added: “I’m glad the prison service are out speaking to the community. They should be.”Councillors were also in attendance at the information session, but couldn’t comment directly on the proposals as they are yet to come through the planning system.The SPS’s Tom Fox said it was inevitable that locals were concerned, but added: “Most of these are based on ideas of something that this unit isn’t.‘‘It is not a prison.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9ae43941b-846x564.jpg ","title":"thousands across dundee celebrate ramadan and locals invited to join evening meal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of Muslims in Dundee have started celebrating the holy month of Ramadan – and locals are being invited to take part to find out more about the festival.Ramadan takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the first revelation of the Koran to Muhammad.Bashir Chohan, head of Dundee Islamic Society, said that as of Thursday, Muslims from 13 nationalities across the city were observing the event.Mr Chohan said: “It is an important event in the Muslim calendar and involves a period of fasting for the next 30 days.“We fast from dawn until dusk when we are allowed to begin eating again.“I have my first meal of the day at 9.30pm when we usually begin eating with a selection of snacks.“We eat all sorts of food at this time from east and west and often begin with a cold drink or a milkshake.”Mr Chohan explained that fasting was for adults with children beginning to take part from the age of about 10-12.He said: “It is up to children and their families to decide when the children can cope with fasting.”Mr Choham said that at night, following the breaking of the fast, Muslims would be going along to the five mosques in the city to pray.“We listen to the Imam reciting from the Koran for an hour and we say special prayers,” he said.“And while at the mosque we serve around 300 to 400 meals a night to visitors.”During Ramadam, Mr Chohan said that Muslims were also expected to be on their best behaviour at all times.“Of course we should always be on our best behaviour but it is particularly important during Ramadan,” he said.“Ramadan is a very spiritual time for us. It is a peaceful time and an opportunity to repair body and soul.“We eat for the rest of the year and it is an order from God to obey his rules and take part in fasting and prayer during Ramadan.”Mr Chohan said that, as always, he would welcome Dundee residents to visit the mosques during Ramadan.He said: “Anyone is welcome to visit our mosques and take part in what is happening during the month.“We would be delighted for people to come along and see what we do and take part if they so wish.“Women as well as men are very welcome to attend.

That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Saturday 19 May 2018 7:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04097000/04097386.jpg","title":"Community buyout plans for castle","story":"\u0026nbspBOLD plans for a community buyout of Urquhart Castle visitor centre overlooking Loch Ness \u0026ndash which could generate millions of pounds for the local economy \u0026ndash will be discussed at a public meeting next week.The site, visited by almost half a million people last year, making it one of Scotland\u0027 most popular tourist attractions, is operated by the government agency Historic Environment Scotland (HES).But a community group believes the tourist attraction could generate much-needed funds for local projects ranging from road improvements to supporting a childcare centre if it was run by locals.It wants to explore the possibility of using community asset transfer legislation to acquire the visitor centre, car park and land along with the neighbouring tourist information centre and Loch Ness Homes parkland.The Glen Urquhart Rural Community Association (Gurca) is urging people to give their views at a meeting at Glenurquhart Public Hall, starting at 7.30pm next Tuesday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLoch Ness tourism expert Willie Cameron, a spokesman for Gurca which includes community and business representatives, said there had been some initial meetings to discuss the idea.\"At this stage, it is a proposal,\" he said. \"No action is going to be taken until the meeting when we will find out the will of the people.\"If support was forthcoming, the next step would be to carry out a feasibility study but he believed Urquhart Castle had the potential to bring in revenue for infrastructure projects such as pothole repairs, improved footpaths and cycle ways, as well as supporting local facilities such as the day care centre and a childcare centre.\"We have a cash cow sitting on our doorstep but it seems not a penny is coming into the area,\" he said.\"We have potholes on the A82.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
