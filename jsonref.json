It was also reported that Diana picked out the jewel herself, while others claim that she chose it because it was the biggest and reminded her of her mother’s engagement ring.Princess Diana loved her engagement ring so much that she continued to wear it after her orce from Prince Charles in 1996 and it was made into a bracelet. She then started wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring in its place, the same one that Meghan Markle wore with her second wedding dress.          Princess Diana loved her engagement ring and continued to wear it after her orcePrincess Diana’s jewellery collectionGrant Mobley, a gemologist and Director at Pluczenik and one of the world’s leading diamantaires, said: ‘A beautiful ring that Princess Diana was seen wearing on her ring finger after her orce from Prince Charles was an emerald cut, aquamarine and diamond ring.He continued: ‘The Princess was very fond of a pearl and diamond bracelet featuring a large emerald cut aquamarine that she was given in her early years as a princess and, after her orce, she commissioned this matching ring to be made.‘Diana’s taste in jewellery was impeccable and the fact that she commissioned this ring to be made is a clear testament to her taste.           Meghan Markle seen here wearing Princess Diana\u0027s aquamarine ring to her wedding reception\u0027She always chose diamond jewellery that was meaningful to her - she was very intentional with her jewellery choices and made sure they were the best representation of those meaningful moments,’ he said, as reported in The Express.The aquamarine ring is thought to be around £75,000 because of the size, colour and quality of the centre diamond and a diamond from one of her rings was also used to make Meghan Markle’s engagement ring.Meghan Markle’s engagement ringDespite including a stone from Botswana and two diamonds from Princess Diana’s personal collection, Meghan Markle’s engagement ring was compared to one available from Argos for just £33. The ring was made by Cleave and Company, Court Jewellers and Medallists for Her Majesty.          Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during an official photocall to announce their engagementSarah Filippardos, head jewellery buyer at Argos, told The Sun: \u0027Prince Harry\u0027s choice of a diamond trilogy ring for Meghan is beautiful. For anyone inspired by Harry\u0027s act of romance who isn\u0027t able to pop to Botswana for a diamond, Argos has a fantastic range of similar trilogy engagement rings with prices starting from as little as £32.99.\u0027However, TheDiamondStore.co.uk estimated that it cost £199,475 and the stone is likely to be a D in colour (the clearest). Meghan also paid tribute to her late mother-in-law on her wedding day and wore Diana’s engagement ring to her wedding reception.          Meghan Markle\u0027s ring includes a stone from Botswana and two from Princess Diana’s collectionKate Middleton’s engagement ringWhen Diana passed away in 1997, Prince William and Prince Harry inherited her jewellery collection, which included her engagement ring, according to Good Housekeeping. The late Princess wrote: ‘I would like you to allocate all my jewellery to the share to be held by my sons, so that their wives may, in due course, have it or use it. I leave the exact ision of the jewellery to your discretion.’          Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton with his mother, Princess Diana\u0027s engagement ringThere are rumours that while Harry originally picked out the iconic sapphire gem, after he saw William’s love for Kate Middleton, the Prince exchanged the engagement ring for his mother’s Cartier watch, so that the Duke of Cambridge could propose to this Duchess.          Kate Middleton\u0027s engagement ring is shown as she holds the arm of her fiance Prince WilliamPrince William reportedly had the ring with him for three weeks while they were on holiday in Mount Kenya in 2010 and when he announced the engagement, he said: ‘It’s my mother’s engagement ring, and it’s very special to me, as Kate is very special to me now as well.‘It was only right the two were put together. It was my way of making sure mother didn’t miss out on today and the excitement,’ the Duke said, as reported in Marie Claire. After making a few alterations, Kate’s ring became one of the world’s most famous rings, now worth over $500,000 (£393,000).

She was not within hearing range. I didn\u0027t even realize who it was. That\u0027s literally the only time I\u0027ve ever laid eyes on her.\u0027Banks had apparently been invited to Musk\u0027s home by his girlfriend Grimes, who was planning to collaborate with Banks.Tesla\u0027s value plunges by $5.5BILLION after tearful CEO Elon...Tesla whistleblower claims its staff in Nevada trafficked...Share this articleBut Grimes\u0027 rep said there was a miscommunication as Grimes and Musk had made arrangements to go out of town. Banks was left alone in the house, hanging on for Grimes to return.She said she arrived at one of Musk\u0027s homes in Los Angeles early on Friday, August 10, but said she was left alone for days while Grimes comforted her boyfriend. Banks finally left on Sunday night.           Elon Musk\u0027s tweet saying he was considering taking Tesla private has sparked controversy          Elon Musk, pictured with his musician girlfriend Grimes last month, has since revealed he was suffering the \u0027most difficult and painful year of his career\u0027 in an emotional interview   Tesla shares dropped sharply in early trading, wiping billions off the value of the company\u0027Staying in Elon musks house has been like a real like episode of \u0027Get Out\u0027, she wrote. \u0027They bring me out there on the premise that we would hang and make music,\u0027 Banks she said. \u0027But his dumb**s kept tweeting and tucked his d**k in between his a** cheeks once s**t hit the fan.\u0027 In subsequent posts, Banks even suggested that the couple may have invited her to their home for \u0027some weird threesome sex s**t to begin with.\u0027 She also went on a vicious rant about Grimes, who she branded an \u0027idiot, Musk who she called a \u0027beta male\u0027 and branded them both \u0027crackhead\u0027 in a rambling attack.Meanwhile, Tesla\u0027s share price plummeted on Friday after Musk, who is facing mounting pressure and an SEC investigation over the tweet he sent claiming to have \u0027secured funding\u0027 to take Tesla private, broke down crying in an extraordinary interview with the New York Times. Tesla shares ended the day down nine percent to $306 after a series of falls in the wake of the tweet and ensuing controversy, wiping around $5.5bn off the value of the company.           The controversial rapper Musk was freaking out about having claimed in a tweet last week that he\u0027d already secured funding to take Tesla private. She also claimed that the 47-year-old had taken acid before he sent that tweet           Musk described the past year as \u0027excruciating\u0027 and the \u0027most difficult and most painful year of his career\u0027. The interview also raises concerned about Musk\u0027s drug use. It claimed the board is aware that he has occasionally used \u0027recreational drugs\u0027 and Musk himself admits to frequently relying on Ambien to sleep.The paper also claims that Tesla\u0027s board is concerned about his posts on Twitter while under the influence of Ambien and have urged him to quit social media. Additionally Musk denied he was \u0027on weed\u0027 or \u0027stoned\u0027 when he sent the tweet claiming to be taking Tesla private for a $420 share, although he acknowledged the value could be taken as a reference to marijuana. He said: \u0027It seemed like better karma at $420 than at $419. But I was not on weed, to be clear.\u0027 The newspaper reported that Musk had \u0027alternated between laughter and tears\u0027 in the interview and said he had not taken more than a week off work since 2001.He admitted he relied on medication to help him sleep, saying: \u0027It is often a choice of no sleep or Ambien.\u0027According to the New York Times article, board members have noticed that Ambien \u0027contributes\u0027 to his late-night Twitter posts. It says they are also \u0027aware\u0027 that he has occasionally used recreational drugs. Friends are also worried about his health.         The entrepreneur said: \u0027It\u0027s not been great, actually. I\u0027ve had friends come by who are really concerned.\u0027He admitted he had rounded up from $419 to set the possible price, offering an approximate 20 per cent premium over the market value, but said: \u0027Weed is not helpful for productivity. There\u0027s a reason for the word \u0027stoned.\u0027 You just sit there like a stone on weed.\u0027 The surprise tweets caught the eye of the Securities and Exchange Commission, with regulators looking into whether the statements were truthful and why Musk announced them via Twitter.Additionally, Musk and Tesla are being sued by investors who claim the plan to go private was part of a \u0027fraudulent scheme\u0027 to punish short-sellers, or investors who borrow stock in a company with the hope shares will fall. The plaintiffs also allege that Musk\u0027s announcements artificially inflated Tesla\u0027s stock price and violated securities laws. Shares of Tesla were sliding more than 1 percent to $351.80 on Monday morning. Musk attempted to clear up his tweets in the blog post Monday. \u0027Going back almost two years, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund has approached me multiple times about taking Tesla private,\u0027 Musk wrote in the blog post.     Musk added that investor support was \u0027confirmed\u0027 and that the Tesla board had already met \u0027several times\u0027 in the past few weeks to discuss the proposal to take the firm private\u0027They first met with me at the beginning of 2017 to express this interest because of the important need to ersify away from oil.\u0027They then held several additional meetings with me over the next year to reiterate this interest and to try to move forward with a going private transaction,\u0027 Musk added. Musk\u0027s extra-curricular activities have previously hit the headlines when, earlier this year, he admitted attending a now infamous drug-fueled sex soiree in Silicon Valley in June 2017. He said he didn\u0027t know it was a sex party. \u0027Elon was at the party for a couple hours and left around 1am after talking with several DFJ-funded entrepreneurs about technology and building companies\u0027, said his reps.\u0027His impression was that it was a corporate party with a costume theme, not a \u0027\u0027sex party,\u0027\u0027 and there was no indication that it would become one after he left,\u0027 the statement concluded.The \u0027sex party\u0027 was held at former DFJ investor Steve Jurvetson\u0027s home.    Weekend at Elon’s: A Tesla Subplot With Azealia Banks - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/18/07/4F2CF34900000578-0-image-m-29_1534575330671.jpg","title":"Danielle Lloyd branded rich b paying make child girl","story":"    Danielle Lloyd, pictured at home with her sons (from left) Harry, seven, Ronnie, 10 months, George, five, and Archie eight, has made a name for herself with outspoken views To Danielle, this is a straightforward matter.She has four boys already and now she wants to bring some balance to her young family.After all, gender selection is already a multi-million-dollar industry in America, where she will go, and it is clear that well-off Britons are already taking advantage of the service offered by clinics in California and elsewhere.But the process, condemned by the World Health Organisation (WHO), is illegal in this country – and the backlash against Danielle has been furious.The 34-year-old explains she has received thousands of angry messages on Instagram and Twitter, some of them extreme, the worst from women who admit they cannot have children of their own.Khloe Kardashian enjoys a night off mummy duty with beau...The 39-year-old mother with a HEART-SHAPED WOMB: Russian...Share this articleSpeaking for the first time about the tide of abuse, she says: ‘They called me a “selfish, disgusting b****” who should be thankful for my four miracle babies.’One desperate woman asked for some of her eggs.‘I didn’t know what to say back. I’d never even thought about that. It was all quite shocking,’ she says. ‘I’m very honest and don’t beat around the bush, but I didn’t expect the amount of vitriol.‘It was like a bomb had gone off. I didn’t even think I had said anything that bad, but I admit that perhaps I didn’t really think about it that much.’Liverpool-born Danielle had three sons, Archie, Harry and George, with her ex husband Jamie O’Hara, the former Tottenham Hotspurs midfielder. The couple orced in 2014. Her fourth son, Ronnie, is with her fiancé, electrician Michael O’Neill.She continues: ‘I want a girl and if I can pay for it, then that’s OK, I can get one.’          The 34-year-old, pictured at home, has received thousands of angry messages on Instagram and Twitter, some of them extreme, on the subject of gender selection for babies  Danielle and fiancé, electrician Michael O’Neill, during her pregnancy with fourth son RonnieIt is, as she has found, a highly controversial stance – which makes it all the more remarkable that Danielle has agreed to address it head-on.The WHO says that sex selection raises ‘serious moral, legal, and social issues’ and can lead to the devaluation of women and gender imbalance.For all the public and official hostility, though, the fact is that the industry is rapidly expanding to meet a huge and growing demand.And if in Britain the demand remains unspoken, in America it is rapidly becoming the norm for those who can afford it.Dr Jeffrey Steinberg at leading US specialists The Fertility Institutes says he routinely treats A-list actors, pop stars and athletes.Tellingly, of 640 couples who came through his doors in 2017, more than one in ten was British.According to Dr Daniel Potter at rival American clinic HRC Fertility, he sees ten patients a month from this country who want to select the gender of their baby.It is, after all, an age-old wish. From cave paintings depicting a preference for sons, to Aristotle’s prescription for producing boys (tying off of the man’s left testicle), attempts to choose the gender of children go back centuries. But Danielle’s decision to obtain – or effectively buy – a baby girl belongs firmly to the scientific realm.She had first heard about the gender selection procedure in the wake of giving birth to Ronnie, now ten months old. Enquiring further, she learnt that the treatment is accurate in 99 per cent of the cases in which a baby is successfully born and started to investigate the possibility of arranging for the selection of a girl child in Northern Cyprus, another state where it is legal.After further questioning, however, she and fiance Michael settled on America, where they felt the overall safeguards would be stronger.The couple will marry next year, and she will travel to California.    Danielle Lloyd, pictured with sons (from left) Harry, Ronnie, George and Archie, had three children with former Spurs player Jamie O\u0027Hara and one with electrician Michael O’NeillOnce there, a number of her eggs will be harvested and fertilised, and then one or two of the resulting female embryos will be reimplanted in the mother’s womb. The rest will be stored for possible use in the future.It will cost her about £12,000 plus flights and accommodation – and that’s just for one round.But to Danielle, getting the little girl that she craves is worth every penny.‘There’s an urge inside me to have a girl. I just can’t let it go,’ she explains.‘I’ve got such an amazing relationship with my mum. I want to have that bond with my daughter. Why would anyone begrudge me that?‘I also want my boys to have that brother-sister relationship. Our family is not yet complete.‘Michael feels the same way. He really wants a girl. If I had four girls, we’d be going off and getting a boy.‘Realistically, if I’m going to have one more, if this science is there, why not do it? I don’t think it’s a selfish thing to do. I could be selfish and go on for years having more and more boys.‘I’ve got four lovely boys but I don’t want to get to 50 or 60 and think I could have had a girl but didn’t,’ she adds.‘The thought of not going to my daughter’s wedding or not having those chats I have with my mum. Girls always have that relationship with their mothers.’Her television profile does, she admits, make her a lightning rod for criticism, particularly from those who assume she is not merely comfortably off, but rich. ‘People say, “I bet she’s got ten nannies”.          Danielle Lloyd (pictured at home) will go to America for the gender selection procedure, which has been condemned by the World Health Organisation (WHO)‘It really gets my back up. Actually, no. And, before Michael came along, I did it as a single mother.’She claims to understand her critics’ point of view, yet remains defiantly convinced she has the right to press ahead.‘When I mentioned it on television, people phoned in and said that if they did what I was doing in China, where they can have only one child, the population would be just boys,’ she says.‘They told me stories about baby girls being flushed down the toilet. It makes me feel like crying, but I’m nothing to do with that sort of world.‘If I was sitting here with no kids and saying I’m doing gender selection because I only want a girl and not a boy, then of course I’d expect criticism.‘But I’m not.‘I realise people have strong opinions. But I still don’t understand how anyone can call me a disgrace because I want a little girl as well as my boys. I genuinely don’t get what the big deal is.‘If we were having this debate in America, the attitude would be completely different because gender selection is perfectly legal and respectable there. It’s like IVF. They get the egg, artificially inseminate it and then check if the embryo is a girl or a boy.‘They give you the option of inserting one or two embryos. It might not work with one, so you’d have to pay again.‘Obviously there are women who can’t have children and I can totally understand that. To some of them, what I’m going to do makes me a terrible person.‘But at the same time, a lot of women have asked me to let them know where I’m going for the procedure, because they’d love to go there too.‘Women who had already been through it got in touch to pass on their advice.’Her sons, too, are right behind her, she says.‘They ask me every day “Mummy, have you got a baby sister in your tummy yet?” When it comes to birthdays and Christmases, they ask for a sister,’ says Danielle.‘I can see why some people think it’s wrong and selfish. Why don’t you just appreciate the children you’ve got? And, so on.‘But I really do appreciate them. I live for my children and love being a mum it’s what I was made to do.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/18/01/4F2C2EA600000578-0-image-m-6_1534552659529.jpg","title":"Girl 19 model Downs syndrome win international beauty pageant","story":"    Kate Grant, 19, from Northern Ireland, is the first model with Down\u0027s Syndrome to win an international beauty pageantA teenager has defied doctors who \u0027painted a bleak future\u0027 and said she would never learn to read or speak, by becoming the first model with Down\u0027s Syndrome to win an international beauty pageant.Kate Grant, 19, took the top prize in the Teen Ultimate Beauty Of The World competition, held in Portadown, Northern Ireland, which celebrates ersity.The event has three categories for children, teenagers and over-20s and is open to anyone regardless of weight, height or marital status.It also supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation, a charity that helps fulfill wishes to children with life-threatening conditions.Forty candidates from around the world took part in the pageant, with Kate representing her native northern Ireland. After an interview with a panel of judges, Kate took to the catwalk in a number of themed-outfits, including jeans and white T-shirt for the casual look, a black and white cocktail dress for the formal round and a sparkling, turquoise sequinned dress for the Time to Shine category.   Cross-your-legs-rail!

If no one cookedate food from other cultures in the world what a boring life we\u0027d lead.\u0027Benjamin Tucker said: \u0027Are you honestly saying that white people can’t cook food from other cultures in case they get it slightly wrong?\u0027 Jamie Oliver and Dawn Butler have been contacted for comment. This is not the first time Mr Oliver has sparked controversy with his own versions of traditional recipes.Back in 2014, he enraged West Africans with a Jollof rice recipe on his website causing a huge backlash dubbed \u0027Jollofgate\u0027.Mr Oliver was criticised for his use of cherry tomatoes on the vine, when Jollof rice is traditionally made with blended tomatoes, onions, and bell peppers. The Motley Musings blogger said at the time: \u0027We have to ask ourselves who actually benefits from Jamie Oliver\u0027s appreciation of Jollof rice. This doesn\u0027t necessarily translate into value for Africans. \u0027For so long, different African cultures have been appropriated without any direct benefit to Africans themselves, and people are particularly sensitive to this.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/19/13/4F32525400000578-6075629-Putin_left_met_Austrian_Foreign_Minister_Karin_Kneissl_center_ba-a-4_1534680521885.jpg","title":"Vladimir Putin signs attends wedding Austrias pro Moscow foreign minister","story":"    Russian President Vladimir Putin writes wishes on the car during a wedding of Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl and Austrian businessman Wolfgang Meilinger (left) in Graz, Austria          Putin (left) met Austrian Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl (center) back in 2001 while attending a summit in Slovenia          Bride Kneissl was also pictured dancing with the Russian President as celebrations got underway after the sunny outdoor ceremony Austrian authorities imposed tight security measures around the site of the ceremony near the southern town of Graz for the celebrations as Putin flew in over the weekend.Kneissl, 53, who married businessman Wolfgang Meilinger, invited Putin to the ceremony when the Russian president was visiting Vienna this year, presidential advisor Yuri Ushakov said.The independent foreign minister first met the Russian president 17 years ago at a summit in Slovenia with the then US President George Bush in July 2001.She has sharply criticised the EU\u0027s handling of Brexit and Catalonia\u0027s drive for independence and poured scorn on Angela Merkel\u0027s open-door migration policy, which she has called \u0027grossly negligent\u0027.

Truth isn\u0027t truth.\u0027The former New York City mayor went on to clarify he meant \u0027truth isn\u0027t truth\u0027 when two witnesses give conflicting reports in an investigation. He cited former FBI director James Comey\u0027s  claim that Trump talked to him about his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who was being investigated as part of the Russia probe.Originally the president\u0027s team said Trump did not ask Comey to drop its look at Flynn and the Russia investigation when the two men met in February 2017. But Giuliani said last week the two men did not discuss Flynn at all. Comey, who was then FBI director, claims Trump said to him: \u0027I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\u0027But Giuliani said on CNN last week: \u0027There was no conversation about Michael Flynn.\u0027 Flynn, who was Trump\u0027s first national security adviser, pled guilty in December to lying to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador and is cooperating with Mueller\u0027s investigation. He resigned from the White House after 24 days when it was revealed he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about  conversations he had with Sergey Kislyak after the election.But Giuliani seemed to realize his \u0027truth isn\u0027t truth\u0027 statement could be misinterpreted, telling Todd \u0027Don\u0027t do this to me,\u0027 when the \u0027Meet the Press\u0027 host groaned, put his head in his hands, and pushed him on the issue.  Trump claims members of the press phoned to APOLOGIZE for...Trump says he \u0027allowed\u0027 White House attorney Donald McGahn...\u0027He will go down as easily the WORST in history\u0027: Trump...Share this articleTodd laughed, put his head in his hands and shook his head back and forth when Giuliani made his statement and said: \u0027Truth isn\u0027t truth?

Comey says you did talk about it. So tell me what the truth is. If you\u0027re such a genius.\u0027Todd then brought up White House counsel Don McGahn, who the New York Times reported is talking to Mueller\u0027s team: \u0027Don McGahn might know.\u0027 \u0027Don McGahn doesn\u0027t know,\u0027 Giuliani said. The former mayor went on: \u0027So we have two pieces of evidence: Trump says he didn\u0027t tell him. The other guy says that he did say it. So which is the truth?\u0027Todd conceded Giuliani had a point. \u0027Alright on that point you\u0027re right, on two people,\u0027 he said.          Giuliani clarified he was talking about the conflicting reports witnesses give on an incident during an investigation          Giuliani also talked about the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting attended by Donald Trump Jr.Negotiations have been ongoing between Trump\u0027s legal team and the special counsel\u0027s team on whether the president will sit down with them.Giuliani was also asked about the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, where Donald Trump Jr., Trump\u0027s son-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort meet with a Russian lawyer who had ties to the Kremlin.He doubled down on Trump\u0027s assertion the meeting - which took place during the heart of the presidential campaign - was to get information on Hillary Clinton.\u0027Because the meeting was originally for the purpose of getting information about Clinton\u0027 he said. \u0027That was the original intention of the meeting. It turned out to be a meeting about another subject and it was not pursued at all,\u0027 he added. \u0027And, of course, any meeting with regards to getting information on your opponent is something any candidate\u0027s staff would take. If someone said, I have information about your opponent, you would take that meeting.\u0027He also said the Trump campaign team didn\u0027t know they were meeting with a Russian and that the attorney, Natalia Veselnitskaya, did not represent the Kremlin.\u0027She didn\u0027t represent the Russian government. She was a private citizen. I don\u0027t even know if they knew she was Russian at the time. All they had were her name,\u0027 Giuliani said. \u0027They knew it when they met with her. Not when they set up the meeting.\u0027He added: \u0027All they knew was a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them.\u0027However, Donald Trump Jr. posted the emails about the meeting on his Twitter account.The emails were sent to Trump Jr via Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who represented Emin Agalarov, whose father, Aras Agalarov, is a major real estate developer close to Putin and who bought rights to the 2013 Miss Universe pageant that took place in Moscow and which Trump attended.One of the messages notes the meeting is with a \u0027Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow.\u0027 Explanations for the Trump Tower meeting, which has become a focal point of  Mueller\u0027s investigation into Russia\u0027s role in the 2016 election, have varied and a tweet from the president in early August added yet another one when he wrote the meeting was about Clinton.But the original statement from Donald Trump Jr about the meeting - which President Trump helped craft - said it was about Russian adoptions.  Donald Trump Jr. gave the New York Times a statement in July 2017, when the paper broke the story, that said the gathering was about an adoption program. His statement did not address whether the presidential campaign was discussed.The Russian lawyer at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has led a multipronged attack against the Magnitsky Act, an American law that blacklists suspected Russian human rights abusers and championed by financier Bill Browder, who Russian President Vladimir Putin named during the Helsinki press conference as someone Russians want to speak to in exchange for letting Mueller talk to Russian nationals.The Magnitsky Act so enraged Putin he retaliated by halting American adoptions of Russian children."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/19/17/4F36CFCB00000578-6076093-image-a-24_1534695428929.jpg","title":"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey fully admits companys bias left leaning","story":"    Jack Dorsey sat down with CNN\u0027s Brian Stelter Friday where he admitted his company\u0027s bias to be \u0027more left-leaning\u0027His comments come following criticism from conservatives, including President Trump, that Twitter is \u0027shadow-banning\u0027 right-wing users to stifle their voices on the platform .Shadow banning is the act of blocking a user or their content from an online community without being apparent to the user. Last month, President Trump tweeted: \u0027Twitter \u0027SHADOW BANNING\u0027 prominent Republicans.

The largest Venezuelan bank note is currently 100,000 bolivars but a cup of coffee costs 2million, making paper money effectively worthless (pictured, money on the streets of Caracas after it was thrown at police by protesting medical workers)           Maduro also wants to raise gas prices, which are currently the cheapest in the world, to tackle smuggling and raise the minimum wage by 3,000 per cent The largest current paper note is the 100,000 bolivar note, but it is worth just 3 cents at the black market rate.A single cup of coffee costs more than 2million bolivars, though that amount is increasing every day. The new currency will have two coins and paper notes ranging from 2 up to 500.The lowest represents the buying power of 200,000 current bolivars while the highest stands in for 50 million.The old and new currencies will remain in circulation together during a transitional period.The government made a similar move in 2008, when then-President Hugo Chavez issued new currency that eliminated three zeros to combat soaring inflation.Maduro also announced Friday a more-than-3,000 percent leap in the minimum wage, though it is unclear when that change will come in.Adding to confusion, Maduro said he wants to peg wages, prices and pensions to the petro - a cryptocurrency announced in February but which has yet to start circulating. He said one petro would equal $60, with the goal of moving toward a single floating exchange rate in the future tied to the digital currency.  Venezuelans spent the weekend stocking up on basic supplies, fearful that the start of the new currency on Tuesday will worsen food shortages          The crisis has also sent thousands of migrants fleeing for the borders as South America\u0027s formerly most successful country falls apart\u0027The next few days will be very confusing for both consumers and the private sector, especially commercial retailers,\u0027 said Asdrubal Oliveros, director of Caracas-based Ecoanalitica. \u0027It\u0027s a chaotic scenario.\u0027A coalition of opposition leaders and union officials said Sunday they are calling for a strike and protest on Tuesday.\u0027The measures announced on Friday are not any economic recovery plan for the country,\u0027 opposition leader Andres Velasquez said. \u0027On the contrary, they represent more hunger, more ruin, more poverty, more suffering, more pain, more inflation, more deterioration of the economy.\u0027Business owners say they fear the sudden wage hike would make them unable to pay employees without sharply increasing prices, despite Maduro\u0027s call to help small and mid-sized businesses for the first three months.Jesus Pacheco, who employs six people at his butcher shop in Caracas, said Sunday that he may have no option but to let go some of his employees to stay in business. He expects the slaughterhouse prices will go up for him.\u0027You\u0027re going to buy products, and they\u0027re more expensive,\u0027 Pacheco said. \u0027We are going to have to fire employees.

This photograph shows the iding line between the Kawangare slum and the affluent Loresho neighbourhood. Kawangare is one of Kenya\u0027s fastest-growing slums where around 650,000 people live, most of whom survive on less than $1 per day. Running water is scarce and the supply is often interrupted while there is only a basic sewer system, leading to high rates of disease. Many people living here are also HIV positive          Another image of Nairobi, showing the iding line between the slum of Kibera and a nearby golf course. Kibera is the largest slum in Africa and one of the largest anywhere in the world. Around 2.5million people, or 60 per cent of Nairobi\u0027s population, lives in this settlement but occupies just 6 per cent of the land. The average dwelling measures just 12ft by 12ft, and often sleeps multiple families inside          Mumbai, India. On the left of the image is the edge of the Dharavi slum, once the largest in India and the setting for the film Slumdog Millionaire. On the right are houses for more affluent residents who work at the National Stock exchange and some of India\u0027s largest companies, which are headquartered on the other side of the Mithi River (left)          The Dharavi is one of the most densely populated areas anywhere in the world. It was founded in 1883 under British colonial rule to accommodate factory workers pushed out of the city centre by the government, and was where poor rural workers landed after coming to the city. The blue rooftops are actually plastic tarps, used to keep the monsoon rains out          Mexico is one of the most unequal countries in the world, with just four men believed to control around 10 per cent of the entire wealth of the nation. This is Santa Fe, a former garbage dump and slum which was partly converted into an upmarket business and shopping district which fast became a symbol of wealth, though reminders of its past remain          Slums originally grew up around the landfill in Santa Fe as people worked as garbage pickers, selling whatever they could recover from the dump. The government initially intended to relocated everyone living here to make way for the new buildings, but after violent resistance from some, they were allowed to stay          Newly built housing in the Ixtapaluca development in Mexico City sits alongside low-income housing in the Alfredo del Mazo area. While it is not pictured, Mexico City is home to the world\u0027s second-largest slum area, called Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl, which comprises almost 1.2million people living in cramped, poured-concrete houses like the ones pictured on the right here          While most of Mexico\u0027s slums are seas of endless grey from the concrete, they are also threaded through with colour thanks to street markets which use brightly-coloured awnings for the stalls. For most of the city\u0027s poor, these markets provide everything from food to electronics          Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In 2012 the US estimated that around 70 per cent of the city\u0027s population lived in slums such as this one, located in the northern suburb of Mikocheni.

The slum is home to 30,000 who live in just 8,500 shacks. The homes are sandwiched between a graveyard, a fetid river and two wealthier suburbs. Power lines run above the shacks, bringing electricity to the rest of the city, by providing none for those who live below them          Johannesburg, South Africa.

The slum was created in the 1950s to house black people resettled from white-only areas during apartheid          Bloubosrand (left) is another wealthy suburb of Johannesburg with an average house price of more than £50,000. On the right is the slum of Kya Sands, which is filled with virtually worthless tin shacks. What look like roads running through the settlement are actually polluted waterways, while in the past it has been plagued by fires and xenophobic violence          Casey Park, Johannesburg. A tight knot of slum dwellings is located next to a section of much more affluent housing          Papwa Sewgolum Golf Course (left) is located next to a slum which sits just meters from the tee for the 6 hole. The golf course is named for Sewsunker Sewgolum, an apartheid-era golfer of India descent who won the 1965 Natal Open in Durban despite being the only non-white player in a field of 113. He was forced to receive his trophy outside in the pouring rain while the white player sat inside, because the clubhouse was whites only          Imizamo Yethu is a suburb of Hout Bay, in Cape Town. It is comprised of a designed housing area (left) and a slum area (right).

Venezuelans spent the weekend stocking up on basic supplies, fearful that the start of the new currency on Tuesday will worsen food shortages          The crisis has also sent thousands of migrants fleeing for the borders as South America\u0027s formerly most successful country falls apart\u0027The next few days will be very confusing for both consumers and the private sector, especially commercial retailers,\u0027 said Asdrubal Oliveros, director of Caracas-based Ecoanalitica. \u0027It\u0027s a chaotic scenario.\u0027A coalition of opposition leaders and union officials said Sunday they are calling for a strike and protest on Tuesday.\u0027The measures announced on Friday are not any economic recovery plan for the country,\u0027 opposition leader Andres Velasquez said. \u0027On the contrary, they represent more hunger, more ruin, more poverty, more suffering, more pain, more inflation, more deterioration of the economy.\u0027Business owners say they fear the sudden wage hike would make them unable to pay employees without sharply increasing prices, despite Maduro\u0027s call to help small and mid-sized businesses for the first three months.Jesus Pacheco, who employs six people at his butcher shop in Caracas, said Sunday that he may have no option but to let go some of his employees to stay in business.

Running water is scarce and the supply is often interrupted while there is only a basic sewer system, leading to high rates of disease. Many people living here are also HIV positive          Another image of Nairobi, showing the iding line between the slum of Kibera and a nearby golf course. Kibera is the largest slum in Africa and one of the largest anywhere in the world. Around 2.5million people, or 60 per cent of Nairobi\u0027s population, lives in this settlement but occupies just 6 per cent of the land. The average dwelling measures just 12ft by 12ft, and often sleeps multiple families inside          Mumbai, India.

The pair have a history of bitter disagreement over emissions policy.Abbott, who signed Australia up to the Paris climate agreement in 2014, said using energy policy to reduce emissions was “madness”.“I am just interested in trying to ensure that Australians have the lowest possible power prices and that people’s jobs are safe ... what that means is that we stop running a power system to reduce emissions,” he said.To placate the dissenters, Turnbull late last week moved to strip the emissions reduction target from the legislation.That did little to assuage the concerns of Turnbull’s internal opponents. Government MPs began sounding out conservative figurehead, Peter Dutton, the home affairs minister, for a possible leadership challenge. Abbott reportedly said he would give his support to Dutton.The Coalition held an emergency meeting on Sunday night to discuss the energy policy, and a poll published at roughly the same time showed a significant in decrease in support for the government, piling more pressure on Turnbull.On Monday, Turnbull capitulated and announced he would not include any emissions reduction target in his National Energy Guarantee policy. He said it was clear the government, which holds only a single-seat majority in the lower house, did not have the numbers.“Now in politics you have to focus on what you can deliver and that’s what we’ve done and will continue to do,” Turnbull said on Monday. Turnbull said he had “absolute support” of his party and Dutton.The decisions earned him the praise of maverick Coalition MPs. One conservative, George Christensen, a Queensland senator, said of Turnbull’s decision: “We have a new energy policy thanks to a band of ‘Liberal National rebels’ who stood firm and fought for common sense.”The debate comes as Australia deals with unusually early bushfires in the state of New South Wales. Environmental scientists have described the winter fires as “mind-bending”, and “unusual in the extreme”, and say climate change is extending the normal bushfire season.Successive Australian governments have struggled to implement climate and energy policies. Attempts to legislate mechanisms to reduce emissions have done enormous damage to former Labor prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard.Rudd faced a sustained and highly effective campaign over plans to introduce an emissions trading scheme in the late 2000s, and Gillard’s carbon pricing mechanism was attacked relentlessly in the lead-up to the 2013 election, which Labor lost.The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, seized on Turnbull’s backdown on Monday and described him as the “white flag prime minister”. “Mr Turnbull has demonstrated that he is not the leader this nation needs,” Shorten said.“Real leadership is about fighting for the principles you believe in. Real leadership is about not always giving in to your enemies every time they disagree with you..”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71d21c477e7be9e0271d5631c5340873f2039d14/0_1428_8558_5134/master/8558.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd00acedc28ceddf96f785671e072d0","title":"mulberry house of fraser profits","story":"Luxury bag firm, which operates 21 concessions in chain’s stores, expects £3m hitThe luxury handbag maker Mulberry has warned that it faces a slump in profits after suffering a £3m hit from House of Fraser’s collapse into administration.Mulberry, which has already reported struggling sales as wealthy tourists favour Paris and Milan over London, operates 21 concessions in House of Fraser, employing 88 staff.Mulberry said the collapse of the department stores group would cost it £3m in the six months to 30 September. Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct, which bought the retailer out of administration, is not obliged to pay the near-£1bn owed to House of Fraser creditors at the time of its collapse.The luxury goods group also warned investors that it continues to face a sales slowdown that will hammer profits in its current financial year to the end of next March.“The UK market has continued to remain challenging and sales in House of Fraser stores have particularly been affected,” the company said. “If these sales trends continue in the UK into the key trading period of the second half of the financial year, the group’s profit for the whole year will be materially reduced.”The company reported a £6.9m pretax profit in its last financial year, a drop from £7.5m after £2m of startup charges and £2.4m of operating costs relating to its new Asia subsidiaries such as Mulberry Korea.In the past year the luxury brand also created new entities in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan as it seeks to capitalise on Asia’s increasing number of middle-class shoppers.“Trading in the rest of the world continues to develop broadly in line with management’s expectations,” the company said. “The group is in a strong cash position and continues to follow its strategy to develop Mulberry into a global luxury brand.”In June, Thierry Andretta, Mulberry’s chief executive, said that while the company was “totally committed” to the UK market he hoped that over the long term the split between UK and international sales would be closer to 5050."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db60c44886665372053fdd1c8ea68f58b1555b05/0_57_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e495b320d10cf258ebdba140d8b9ee55","title":"american ceos pay dysfunction finance","story":"‘Let the market decide’ has been the mantra for decades. This dysfunction and inequality is the inevitable resultA new report from the Economic Policy Institute calls attention to the hardy perennial of how much America’s corporate titans make: bosses of the top 350 firms made an average of $18.9m in 2017. That’s a ratio of 312-1 over the median worker in their industries. Big bucks to be sure. And a big change since 1965, when the ratio was just 20-1. But what does it mean? And if there’s a problem, what is it, exactly?The US numbers have shock value. But bear in mind that they reflect not only the way companies are run, but also changes over decades in the structure of the US economy and tax law, specifically the rise of market valuations in technology and finance at the expense of the major industrial corporations, and a corresponding decline in unions, which held down the ratios in the sectors the industrial firms dominated a half century back. Plus, there is the radical decline in top marginal tax rates on income and capital gains, beginning in 1978, which gave executives strong reasons to restructure their pay away from inside-the-corporation perks (the penthouses and country clubs of yore) and toward cash and capital assets. The reliance of tech firms on venture capital and bubble psychology, rather than cash flow, deepened this trend. Note also that there is something a bit artificial about the resulting “wealth.” Jeff Bezos may have a net worth of over $150bn, mostly in Amazon stock, but he couldn’t convert it into cash if he wanted to, neither by selling nor by borrowing. Any effort to sell would demolish Amazon’s valuation and hence his own fortune. The rich aren’t like us – they have more money, true, but some of it isn’t really money and it can disappear, by the billions, pretty fast.Further, we know about the 350 CEOs because they head public companies – not hedge funds or private equity firms – and the SEC can (under mandate of law) oblige disclosure of how executives and workers are paid. Is the US really so exceptional? Compared to Japan, probably so the Japanese have largely retained the successful industrial model that displaced major American industrial firms a generation back. Compared to Germany, we can’t know German firms are in greater proportion privately held, so they don’t report, and German elites have memories of the Red Army Faction that induce caution and discretion, not advertisement of their wealth. Compared to British bankers, likely there’s not much to choose between the ultra-wealthy of London and New York. Let’s not get started on Russian oligarchs or Saudi princes, compared to whom US CEOs earn a pittance. The EPI report makes the easy, transparent and irrefutable argument that CEO pay is unrelated to skill. It’s an artifact of the general mood of the stock market and of the specific fads and power of technology, finance and oil. But we don’t need this evidence to overthrow the tired talking point of an efficient (labor) market. If the great financial crisis didn’t blow that one up for you, nothing will. The important issue raised by this report is one that it doesn’t discuss. Was it a good idea to align CEO compensation in the country’s largest corporations with the casino of the stock market? This has been the mantra of finance economists since the 1970s – maximize shareholder value! Let the market decide! Let the workers and the consumers and the public fend for themselves! The mantra has produced a world of corporate predators, looters and asset strippers, of technology and bank wealth on the coasts and industrial wastelands in between. In our era of quantitative easing and tax cuts to fuel stock buybacks, it has led to government policies aimed at making the stock market boom, while the corporations and their customers pile up the resulting debts. And so we have a country of wealth, dynamism and power, afflicted by decay, displacement, unemployment, foreclosures and blight – a country riven by resentments and anger and capable of believing the nostrums and bluster of Donald J Trump. America’s top 350 comfortable and coddled CEOs are not really responsible for this. For all I know, they are mostly hard-working, dedicated and capable men and women. But they are surely a fine microcosm of what we have become."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46630eeb7419aa7f599e33d5e43687658baed406/0_116_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=741e5dab9ba6aff23d714ddf5a17b39f","title":"me too edinburgh festival comedy young women","story":"2018 may be the year of young women as their influence goes far beyond the fringe. But amplifying voices is not enoughWhy are men, who have the whole world at their mercy, not funny? Please do not pretend not to know what I am talking about. To subvert Christopher Hitchens’ infamous Vanity Fair piece: I’m not saying that men are humourless, or cannot make good wits or comedians. But, almost a year after a string of accusations by women against Harvey Weinstein kickstarted the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements, male comedians simply aren’t having the most groundbreaking and hilarious conversations.In Edinburgh, people keep joking that 2018 isn’t a great year to be a straight white man at the fringe and, to an extent, they are correct. Young female comics are grappling with big questions in their shows, in inventive, transgressive, and brilliantly funny ways. Really, in terms of who is smashing it jokes-wise, there’s no contest.Two of the best shows I saw last week – both of which have been garnering four- and five-star reviews from critics – were by comics Rose Matafeo and Kiri Pritchard-McLean. Matafeo’s zany look at her own teenage sexuality and how it interacts with the internet (“Men with their shit together should be a porn category”) delves into her contradictory feelings about men and feminism (“I’d probably fuck the patriarchy if he had nice arms”).Pritchard-McLean’s show is altogether darker, though no less funny (full disclosure: in a bizarre inversion of the old boy network, McLean went to the same Welsh comprehensive as I did, though we are not close and, despite appearances, our school was not, officially at least, some kind of finishing school for angry feminists). Victim, Complex is the comic’s story of being gaslighted by the ex who cheated on her over the course of many years. The term is taken from the 1938 stage play Gaslight, and refers to a particular kind of emotional abuse which involves manipulating another person into doubting their own sanity. Since Donald Trump was elected, and in the wake of #MeToo, it has come into common parlance, spurred by Monica Lewinsky’s Vanity Fair article Emerging from The House of Gaslight and journalist Lauren Duca’s viral Teen Vogue column Donald Trump is Gaslighting America.It’s a form of emotional abuse that feels familiar to many young women, but it’s groundbreaking to see it dissected like this. It’s just one example of how something many of us have long known to be true but rarely articulate for fear of the usual dismissals, especially from men, is suddenly out there in the open, taking up necessary cultural space.Pritchard-McLean’s show is perfectly constructed, and at times deeply moving to the point where some audience members were near tears, yet the pathos is undercut by true belly laughs – but don’t trust me, read the reviews. Or even better, go and see the shows, and those by other young female comics. In addition to Pritchard-McLean and Matafeo, Natalie Palamides, Athena Kugblenu and myriad others are using comedy to grapple with this political moment.Feminist comics and theatre have been tackling difficult subjects for decades, but this year feels different somehow. People are listening, and responding, to young women’s voices. They are treating them as though they matter. They have always, mattered, of course, but now it’s less easy to dismiss them.“We always have had something to say but they have to listen now,” Pritchard-McLean tells me. But things need to change structurally, too. “The big problem now is that most reviewers are middle-aged men. And pervy men with power – from directors to venue owners, producers, high-profile comedians – are well known and retain their power. It’s tiring that it has to be women to sort this, because when we speak up they ignore us anyway. You wonder how long, and how loud, you have to shout for.”It’s not only in stage comedy that young women’s voices have been rising – writers and performers such as Michaela Coel, Issa Rae, Lena Dunham and Phoebe Waller-Bridge were tackling young women’s experiences long before #MeToo, and now there is an even greater appetite for these stories. Vicky Jones’s play The One, about a toxic romantic relationship, has been revived. It would be great to see the transgressive young female voices on the fringe make the jump to television.In literature, too, young women’s voices are being respected and rewarded. There are three women under 30 on the Booker longlist this year. Two of the novels – The Water Cure by Sophie Mackintosh and Normal People by Sally Rooney – have gender and abuse included in their themes, while Daisy Johnson’s Everything Under explores gender roles and gender fluidity. Reni Eddo-Lodge’s Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race has spent weeks in the bestseller charts, as has Dolly Alderton’s Everything I Know About Love (Alderton and co-writer Lauren Bensted are developing a TV comedy about Brexit). The poetry, plays and podcasts of young women are also thriving.It wouldn’t be a stretch to say that 2018 is shaping up to be the year of young women. But it’s important to remember that amplifying voices is not enough. The commercial potential of young women’s voices, the existence of an audience interested in hearing them, is obviously being noted. But on its own it’s not enough. The cultural industries themselves need to change. “They want to monetise us but not make our lives any easier,” says Pritchard-McLean. “Men need to take some responsibility for harbouring perverts, manipulators and abusers. Just because they’re nice to them doesn’t mean they’re not a perv.” Unfortunately, such structural changes are likely to take a hell of a lot longer.• Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a  columnist and author"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44f0edbeeb7b9fc75ab5dc4c47bbac91c2fe5643/76_430_1903_1143/master/1903.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16c46787e50e6525b48ce57dc70a4eb3","title":"right to buy conservatives tory party housing association","story":"Almost a year ago, in panel after panel at the Conservative party conference, audience members and politicians alike expressed both fear and frustration. Fear of Jeremy Corbyn’s popularity among voters under 45, and frustration that when it came to one of the biggest drivers of support for him – the housing crisis – the Tories had no new ideas.One clear predictor of voting intention is your housing tenure, with most private and social renters backing Labour in last year’s general election. Meanwhile, the number of renters is growing as house prices continue to stand at eye-watering heights – even if there have been small decreases recently.Housing tenure can be affected by government policy. Margaret Thatcher, in the 1980s, announced plans to turn Britain into a nation of homeowners, greatly expanding the right to buy council houses – knowing that homeowners by and large vote blue. With far less of this stock now available, the Conservative government, continuing a policy first mooted by David Cameron and George Osborne, are left with housing association property to sell off. As ever, we are fed empty promises that affordable homes will be built to replace those sold, but this has never reached one-for-one levels with the sale of council stock.Right to buy isn’t a heartfelt attempt to get people on to the housing ladder: it’s a move to shift people from a tenancy more secure than most private rentals into the market, selling off housing association assets at a huge discount. A home can recoup rent for a housing association or council for as long as it stands, with the money being reinvested into housebuilding and local services. Once you sell one of these homes, it’s gone for ever: this is a huge false economy, and ultimately takes property that is desperately needed for low-cost housing out of that market.The move is deeply cynical, and reveals the hatred the Conservatives harbour towards social housing. The bedroom tax turfed people, many of them disabled, out of their homes, while the government disseminated myths about people living it up in council houses the size of small mansions. Then, after complaining about a shortage of social housing, arguing it must only go to the most destitute, the Conservatives push ahead with a fire sale of housing association homes, starting with a pilot scheme involving 70 local authorities in the Midlands.The plan is clearly to further plunder the UK’s dwindling social housing stock until municipal accommodation is a distant memory, and in the process, they hope, create the next generation of homeowning Conservative voters. There is no sound economic basis for such a policy, and the ethical or moral reasons put forward for pursuing it simply do not stand up to scrutiny. This is a naked attempt to buy votes, and the fact it has been tried before shows how truly bereft of ideas the Conservatives are.For years now they have been doomed to desperately try to repeat the policies Thatcher mooted in the 1980s, all the while discovering how far their heroine went in ransacking the state. To paraphrase the Iron Lady: the trouble with Thatcherism is eventually you run out of other people’s assets.But the move to right to buy may not work as intended, and could even backfire. On paper, right to buy looks like a great deal for buyers – until many find they simply can’t keep up with mortgage payments, even with a large initial discount: the cost of food and fuel keeps rising and is drastically outstripping wages.As panicked party members knew last year, the Conservatives have no fresh ideas for housing. This policy – rehashed, reheated and barely thought through – is the perfect example of their floundering efforts, and one that could cost the economy more in the long term, and easily end up costing the Tories votes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90f173708e32ba8335a5f1b80962431fa859c63/0_0_2835_2034/master/2835.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6d49b93f8104f927c7b1e9398be345cf 1440w","title":"new gcses put pupils under more pressure say school leaders","story":"Students to receive results with grades 9-1 after changes initiated by Michael GoveThe tougher standards demanded by the new style of GCSEs being awarded for the first time this year have put pupils under a great deal of additional pressure, according to school leaders.Hundreds of thousands of pupils in England will receive their results this week, with grades from 9 to 1 replacing the familiar A* to G.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the “bar has deliberately been set at a higher level” as a result of changes initiated by the former education secretary Michael Gove.“The new exams are harder, contain more content, and involve sitting more papers,” Barton said. “We are worried about the impact on the mental health and wellbeing of young people caused by these reforms and it is our view that such a substantial set of changes as this should have been introduced in a more managed and considered manner.“It is to the credit of schools that they have responded to this situation by providing their students with extensive pastoral support in order to alleviate stress and anxiety despite severe funding pressures.”Hailed as the most significant change in the examination system since O-levels were replaced 30 years ago, the “more demanding, more fulfilling and more stretching” exams were introduced to help the UK better compete internationally, Gove said in 2013.The fruits of that effort will be seen on Thursday when the results of 20 of the new GCSEs are published, including those in biology, history and Spanish.Gove’s changes stripped out assessed work that had accounted for a substantial proportion of marks towards the final grades. In chemistry and biology, for example, non-exam assessments accounted for a quarter of a candidate’s marks, but in the new GCSEs everything depends on the final exams.Ofqual, which regulates public examinations in England, has pledged to maintain continuity in the proportion of grades awarded. Cath Jadhav, the director of standards at Ofqual, said exam boards would use statistics to counteract any dip in results caused by teachers being less familiar with the content and pupils having less support material.“Across all subjects, grade boundaries will be set this summer to ensure that students this summer are treated fairly and are not disadvantaged by being the first to sit new GCSEs,” Jadhav wrote in a blogpost explaining the way grades would be set.According to Ofqual, the new grade 7 will start at the same standard as the former A grade, meaning 9, 8 and 7 grades replace the old A* and A. The 9 is equivalent to the top half of A* awards, while an 8 encompasses the bottom portion of A* and the top part of an A, making comparisons with the old grades difficult.“Grade 9 is not the same as the old A* grade. It’s a new grade designed to recognise the very best performance. So in every subject there will be fewer grade 9s awarded than A*s in the old GCSEs,” Jadhav said.Last year maths, English language and English literature were the first subjects to be examined under the new system. About 2,000 pupils gained 9s in all three subjects. As few as 200 pupils have been forecast to achieve a full set of 9s in eight or more subjects this year.“It was already very hard to achieve the top grade of A* under the old system, and it is even harder to achieve the top grade of a 9 under the new system,” Barton said. “Young people striving for those top grades may therefore feel disappointed if they do not achieve them, even though they have done exceptionally well in the grades they do achieve.”Because a number of courses, including economics and design and technology, will not offer the reformed exams until next summer, parents will be confronted with children holding a mixture of numbered and lettered grades.The previous C grade will be fixed to the same boundaries as the new grade 4, but both a 4 and a 5 will be regarded as a pass grade in the same way as a C, with the Department for Education describing a 5 as a “strong pass”.The new combined science GCSE will be awarded as a double grade, to reflect the greater amount of content being taught. As a result, candidates will be awarded double grades ranging from 9-9, 9-8 and so on, down to the lowest 1-1 grade.The changes do not affect Wales and Northern Ireland, which are retaining the old GCSE grades. Scottish students sit exams under a separate system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d63b8a7b8a2b7ba126ac9996d35255de87b223f4/0_0_5115_3069/master/5115.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6dad029c012ab3c3150e8520d5969435","title":"2018 bird photographer of the year in pictures","story":"Pedro Jarque Krebs from Peru scoops the top prize of £5,000 for his vibrant image of American Flamingos preening"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a522097207dff99640aafdac044e90622b4fb0dd/1_0_4014_2409/master/4014.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e468174fb3cb4aa1c9f2f7db30f4871f","title":"gay icons like to dress up bob mackie on cher tina turner and dressing elton john as donald duck","story":"The fashion designer has worked with Marlene Dietrich, Barbra Streisand and Diana Ross, and is most famous for the outfits he created for Cher. Here he reminisces about sequins, surprises – and why he’ll never retireYou could dine out for a lifetime on Bob Mackie’s stories. After 60 years of designing sequin-encrusted stage costumes for Cher, Bette Midler and Diana Ross, to name a few, the 79-year-old has anecdotes to spare. He sprinkles them into conversation like glitter.He once dressed Elton John as Donald Duck, complete with tail and webbed feet, making it very difficult for the Rocket Man to play the piano. He worked with Tina Turner during her post-Ike transformation, when “she wanted to look like a sexy cave woman”. Barbra Streisand, he says, “was always questioning everything. ‘Does this really look good? Can we try on three or four, then decide?’ With that kind of sensibility, you work harder, believe me.”He was friends with Marlene Dietrich, an uber-perfectionist whose gowns would be worn out by multiple minute alterations before they had even left the fitting room. She would also root around “in our community refrigerator, and throw out old food if she found it. And if someone was sick, there was always something in her purse that would work. She was like a grandmother.”And then there is Cher, his closest collaborator, with whom, in the 70s, he developed a design philosophy best described as “more razzle-dazzle, less fabric”. Without him, Cher has said: “I would have been a peacock without feathers.”It is in the shadow of Cher – or, at least, of two Cher-like mannequins – that we meet in a hotel in London. Mackie is in town for the launch of a vast wardrobe clearance. Two days hence, he will board a cruise ship from Southampton to New York City with more than 100 of his sketches and gowns, for a seaborne exhibition to promote a sale at Julien’s Auctions, in Los Angeles and online, on 17 November.Why sell the frocks now? “When you have been in a business as long as I have,” he says, “you end up with a lot of interesting things. I certainly don’t need to keep the lot of them. I still have a lot of memories left.”Although he jokes about his age, Mackie comes across at least 20 years younger than he is: he poses energetically for our photographer, goofing around between the two immobile Cher surrogates. One models a yellow halterneck jumpsuit decorated with a huge sequinned sunflower, the other a crimson, cheongsam-inspired gown embroidered with a gold dragon. Mackie is neatly dressed in a gold-buttoned navy blazer with a cobalt-blue, silk pocket handkerchief. His hair is the colour of weak tea and he has a wide, boyish face. He looks like the treasurer of a local Rotary Club, or a daytime gameshow host, rather than a purveyor of showgirl chic. His face clouds over briefly, just once, when he runs a finger along the seam of the yellow jumpsuit and says it needs to be tweaked. (“I knew he wouldn’t be happy with that,” mutters one of his colleagues.)Some of Mackie’s most vivid memories are of Cher. When they met, he says, her look was totally new: “She was the first hippy, really the bellbottoms, the fur vests, the long straight hair. She created a whole fashion turnaround.” Together, they built her next visual incarnation, which often centred on her naked abs. “The doctor,” he says, “said she had some kind of strange malady of tight stomach muscles.” (Mackie refers frequently to the lithe proportions of his most famous canvas he has been known to point out that her armpits were the best in the business.)Their fashion hits included the sequin-studded, feathered “nude” dress she wore to the 1974 Met Gala, which created “a lot of hullaballoo”. Afterwards, “I got a lot of calls from performers wanting something ‘like Cher wears’ because it got a lot of attention.”More eyeballs were drawn by Cher’s 1986 Oscars ensemble, a sort of “Big Bird goes for a night out with Maleficent in Las Vegas” number, with a perilously low-rise skirt. The outfit was conceived as a dig at the Academy, which, Cher felt, had snubbed her that year. “I wasn’t sure if it was the proper, polite thing to do,” says Mackie, noting that he was “apprehensive” about it (he is always apprehensive, he explains a wardrobe malfunction is often just a millimetre of tit tape away). “Some people were horrified but it was in every newspaper,” he says. Cher loved it, of course. He says, with a knowing smile: “Halloween’s her favourite holiday.”It was often Cher pushing Mackie to create more revealing and outlandish outfits, not the other way around. For example, she came up with the mesh bodysuit worn to mount a cannon in the video for If I Could Turn Back Time. He thought it was “vulgar and horrid. I told her: please, I don’t want any credit for this.”Mackie grew up in a more reserved time. His childhood sounds pretty dour: between the ages of six and 14 he lived with his British grandmother, who “believed children should be seen and not heard”. His escape was the cinema. He recalls the “religious experience” of seeing the ballet scene from An American in Paris for the first time. He built mini movie sets, complete with stars dressed in paper outfits, on top of his dresser.In 1960, he married LuLu Porter, a singer, actor and acting teacher. They had a son, Robin, and orced after three years. That year, when he was 23, he started working on The Judy Garland Show, assisting costume designer Ray Aghayan, who became his partner, in life and business, until his death in 2011.Garland was, he says, “a phenomenally talented inidual, but she had been so mistreated in the beginning, as a child, that she was very troubled”. The show was disastrous, with a high turnover of personnel, but the situation proved unexpectedly useful for Mackie, as he quickly met almost everyone who was anyone in the industry. It sounds tougher for Aghayan who, in the past, Mackie has said, received phone calls from Garland in the middle of the night, asking him to take her to hospital. Clearly, the dark side of Hollywood is never hidden for long, no matter how thick the crust of glitter.Mackie is also from a time before debates about cultural appropriation in design were commonplace. Cher herself has recently been criticised for the 1973 song Half-Breed – even that title might make a contemporary audience wince – and for the Mackie-designed Native American war bonnets she wore when singing it.Mackie doesn’t understand the fuss. “People are becoming much too sensitive about their cultures we’re losing the humour, and that is very sad. She wore that for 40-odd years. Now, all of a sudden, you have a couple of hard-nosed people saying: ‘Oh no, she can’t.’ Well, you’re a little late honey.”That said, he confirms that Cher won’t be wearing a war bonnet for her forthcoming tour, even though he has faithfully remade a lot of the other costumes. “I just ended up doing a whole new costume, with a different twist to it.” (The claim that Cher can sing this song because her mother has some Cherokee heritage seems to hold less water these days. Mackie says: “I don’t know how much Native American blood Cher has in her, I don’t think very much. I think she gets her dark good looks from her Armenian father.”)Mackie’s life is still monopolised by work he is working on the costumes for a huge Cher-themed Broadway musical. “I think I’m the oldest living designer in Hollywood,” he says. Will he ever retire? “I hope not.”Work has been a balm in difficult times. The year 1993 was unbearable. His son died, at 33, from an Aids-related illness, and Mackie was forced to close the New York fashion business he had launched in order to move beyond pure costume design. Rather than lying low to grieve, he went straight back to work, with Midler, on the TV movie Gypsy, a project that, he has said, saved him.Midler, of course, is yet another gay icon: Mackie’s life seems to be inextricably linked with women with that epithet. He himself has been called, “the patron saint of drag queens,” he says. He talks fondly about being chased down the street by half a dozen drag Chers. Gay culture has changed a lot, he says. “It used to be something you didn’t discuss now everyone knows everything and everyone’s an expert.”Has Mackie created gay icons – by swathing them in sequins – or have existing gay icons approached him because they like his aesthetic? “It works both ways,” he says. “Certainly, most gay icons like to dress up.” They are also, often, women who pile on the shimmer to shine at dark times, who must always project otherworldly charisma and talent. That is quite a challenge, says Mackie, “because your public always expects to see it. They want to be delighted – ‘Oh, she’s so beautiful did you see what she wore?’ – but very often these actresses are just homebodies with kids at home and a husband. It’s when they go out and make the bucks they have to change the whole thing.”Perhaps the biggest surprise about Mackie is his earnestness. “I’m very serious about this,” he says. “It’s not just flamboyant, crazy stuff. It’s all very worked out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/700834ac21a5e25e4cf7a3183991a8fd4e08ac7a/0_196_3636_2181/master/3636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec75c0080f41e9d8859750b9337e9fd3","title":"asia argento accused paying off actor metoo weinstein jimmy bennett","story":"The actor and #MeToo campaigner – who accused Harvey Weinstein of rape – reportedly paid $380,000 last year to former co-star Jimmy Bennett One of the most prominent activists of the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment recently settled a complaint filed against her by a young actor and musician who said she sexually assaulted him when he was 17, the New York Times reported. Argento, 42, settled the notice of intent to sue filed by Jimmy Bennett, who is now 22, for $380,000 shortly after she said last October that movie mogul Harvey Weinstein raped her, the Times reported.Argento and Bennett co-starred in a 2004 film The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things, in which Argento played Bennett’s mother.Bennett says in the notice that he had sex with Argento in a California hotel in 2013. The age of consent in California is 18. The notice says the encounter traumatised Bennett, affected his mental health and damaged his career, the Times reported.The notice claims that Bennett arrived at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey to meet Argento in her hotel room on 10 May 2013, with a family member. Argento asked to be alone with Bennett and the family member left. Bennett claims Argento gave him alcohol before proceeding to kiss him and perform oral sex before having intercourse with him. The documents say that Argento then asked to take a number of photos with him. Photos of Argento and Bennett semi-clothed in bed, as well as an Instagram post of their faces taken on that day, were included in the notice of intent to sue. Three people familiar with the case said the documents were authentic, the Times reported.Argento became one of the most well-known activists of the #MeToo movement after she told the New Yorker magazine that Weinstein raped her at the Cannes film festival in 1997 when she was 21. Argento told the magazine that she continued to have a relationship with Weinstein because she was afraid of angering him.Weinstein has been indicted on sex crime accusations involving three women, but not including Argento. He denies all charges of non-consensual sex. Since the Weinstein allegations became public, Argento has spoken out about sexual harassment both in Hollywood and her home country of Italy and given high-profile talks on the subject at Harvard University and at the Cannes film festival. The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things was directed by Argento and based on the novel by JT LeRoy. In the film, she plays a drug-taking prostitute struggling to care for her young son, played by Bennett, who is raped by one of her boyfriends. Her character persuades her son to cross-dress and act as an increasingly seductive “little sister”. Writing on Twitter in the wake of the New York Times report, Rose McGowan – who has also accused Weinstein of assault – wrote that her “heart is broken”.  has reached out to Argento for comment, but at the time of publication had not received a response.

To the person who, in the comments after my recent article about the deadly nightshade family, constructively noted that the aubergine, an Asian plant, was in fact brought to Europe during the middle ages by the Arabs, who cultivated them in Sicily and Spain, where they thrived. The Italian name melanzana, from the latin mala insana, or “unhealthful fruit”, reminds us, though, of how they were perceived by many. In his essay Eggplant – Food of the Plebeians, Massimo Montanari tells us the Renaissance cook Bartolomeo Scappi called the aubergine pomo sdegnoso – “contemptible apple” – and that in 1568 the naturalist Pietro Andrea Mattioli called them pianta volgare – “vulgar plant” – and observed how only the vulgar ate them “fried in oil with salt and pepper”. The writer Costanzo Felici expressed similar distrust for the people who ate the vulgar plant “avidly, cooked for the most part in embers or on the grill, or even fried ...”Even fried! I agree with the Italian proverb (and the conviction of every Glaswegian fish-and-chip shop) that “whatever can be fried is good to eat”, especially plaice, chips – and aubergines. It is aubergine time here now, and at the market they’re upstaging even tomatoes with their inky-black curves and blotting-paper mottles. Aubergines turn my cooking head to Sicily, see me heating pans of oil, despite the heat, to make caponata (aubergine fried in plenty of oil, then united with balanced celery, onion, a little tomato, capers, olives, sugar and vinegar) , or aubergines Ustica-style (fried, then dressed with mint and vinegar). Sometimes I make what my partner Vincenzo’s uncle calls “insoles”– slices of aubergine, boiled or grilled, then dressed with olive oil, or – now that I have the recipe – I make Enza’s aubergines.As you might remember from the pesto alla trapanese recipe three weeks ago, Enza works in the kitchen at the Anna Tasca Lanza cooking school in Sicily. She is a good cook who will tell you her strength is cakes, Sicilian sweets and preserves. But we think her savoury dishes are the very best sort of home cooking: tasty and generous – especially these aubergines. They sound a bit odd written down, but they’re delicious rounds of aubergine, topped first with cheese – such as scarmorza, provola or mozzarella –, then thin rings of onion, nubs of anchovy, and finished with the Sicilian calling card of breadcrumbs, oregano and olive oil. The slices of aubergine slump into softness, the cheese slumps into the aubergine, the onion sinks into the cheese and anchovy into that, and the breadcrumbs and oregano form an irresistible crisp top.As with cheese on toast eaten on a plate on a tea towel in front of the TV, the joy is the contrast between the molten part and the crisp lattice around the edges. Satisfaction, too, is when, as you take a round from the baking tray, you drag a significant piece of cheesy lattice from surrounding pieces which, despite a cursory gesture of cutting it with your fingers, you put on your plate. All is fair in love and crisp bits.At the school, Enza’s aubergines are served either with a great big green salad, or with boiled potatoes tossed with cracked olives, capers, olive oil and sweet onion (red onion works, too – just soak the slices in a mixture of vinegar and water for 20 minutes, which smooths the edges and stops them repeating on you all night). They can be made in advance, but bake as near to eating as possible the cheese should stretch like the telephone cords our kids wouldn’t recognise, and sizzle slightly in your mouth.2 aubergines, cut into 5mm slices (you want 16)Olive oilSalt and black pepper1 onion, peeled and sliced into thin rings400g scamorza, provola, or plain or smoked mozzarella8 anchovies, halvedDried oreganoDry breadcumbsLine a flat baking tray large enough to accommodate the slices in a single layer, with baking parchment.

Share the onion rings between the 16 mounds, topping each with half an anchovy, a pinch of oregano, a grind of black pepper, a good sprinkle of breadcrumbs then zigzag each with more olive oil.Bake at 200C390Fgas 6 for 20 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbling, breadcrumbs crisp and the edges darker.

An opening-day defeat by Watford was desperately disappointing but, as poor as United were, Brighton bossed this match from start to finish. Martín Montoya, a deadline-day arrival from Valencia, impressed on his debut but it was the presence of the wily Glenn Murray and the purring Pascal Gross, a £3m buy from Ingolstadt, that again proved pivotal. Better still, Chris Hughton still has a wealth of attacking talent, including the striker Florin Andone, to infuse his team with. This kind of match will not necessarily define Brighton’s season but they naturally foster optimism. Ben Fisher Burnley are not in the Europa League yet – they still face a final play‑off against Olympiakos beginning this week – but the curse seems to be taking effect. Most uncharacteristically Sean Dyche made half a dozen changes for the last tie against Istanbul Basaksehir, so it is probably not fatigue that is to blame – at least not fatigue from playing extra matches. Yet tiredness from long midweek trips cannot be ruled out, and nor can the hours lost in training and preparation. At least part of the reason Burnley finished seventh last season was because they were able to give the Premier League their unided attention, and Dyche is very good at all the small details that go into readying his side to face bigger opponents. Watford hardly count as that, but they played very well at Turf Moor it was the home side who were a shadow of their usual selves. Burnley are playing more games than anyone else and it shows.

They host Arsenal and Manchester City and visit Chelsea and Burnley across four weeks but the Cardiff manager, who takes his team to Huddersfield before that testing run of fixtures, knows home form will be pivotal: they have lost just once at their own ground in 2018. “We are going to take one or two drubbings in this league, so we just have to not read too many papers at times, when things aren’t going so well and just stick to the task,” Warnock said. “I think this stadium can become a fortress, really. Even the top-six sides, I don’t think they’ll enjoy coming here.” BFSeveral factors were behind the wild entertainment on show at Stamford Bridge on Saturday and one of them was undoubtedly what must now be referred to as The Curious Case of N’Golo Kanté. As was the case against Huddersfield Town on the opening day, a midfielder renowned for his defensive excellence was a notable attacking presence. On 78 minutes he almost scored with a header that flashed just over and was then one of the most advanced players in blue when Marcos Alonso struck late on. Kanté is revelling in the freedom Maurizio Sarri has given him but could the manager’s boldness have the effect of reducing Chelsea’s solidity? There were certainly occasions when Arsenal found pockets of space outside Chelsea’s area that Kanté would have been in, had he not been on another charge upfield. Sachin NakraniUnai Emery preached calm after the game on Saturday, aware his job at Arsenal is but two games old and nobody can fix their mess in that short amount of time. Hopefully he will get that patience and calm, but along the way he needs a bit of help from his players, too. What he doesn’t need is players spurning simple chances, but that’s what he will get with the players at his disposal. Regular watchers of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at Borussia Dortmund will tell you that the striker is capable of the implausible, both good and bad: he will oscillate between brilliant goals and the sort of blooper we saw in the first-half on Saturday, as he skied a shot over a virtually open goal from 10 yards out. The unpredictability of his forward line is just another thing Emery will have to deal with. Nick MillerThe first thing to say is that Wolves will play a lot worse than they did at Leicester and win this season. The woodwork thwarted them on three separate occasions and Matt Doherty missed a sitter when the game was goalless. Adama Traoré produced a bright cameo that showed just how dangerous he can be with his electric pace, while João Moutinho and Rúben Neves are a class act in the centre of midfield. Yet only time will tell whether Wolves have enough quality in the striker department. Although Raúl Jiménez made some intelligent runs and was unlucky to hit a post, the Mexican is not a prolific goalscorer, while Léo Bonatini, who came off the bench and made a hash of a chance that Traoré set up, managed only 12 goals in 43 Championship games. It will be a shame for Wolves if some of their hugely impressive creativity goes to waste. Stuart JamesMauricio Pochettino’s six-minute answer to a question about Toby Alderweireld gave Tottenham’s Kremlinologists much to chew on. For the uninitiated, a summary: there may have been troubles in the past but everyone in the matchday squad against Fulham (the Belgian included) was now committed to the cause. Such commitment is something Pochettino has been talking about since pre-season and, one is free to infer, it may not have been present last term, when Alderweireld barely featured during the run-in. But on Saturday we were reminded what he brings to Tottenham: strength, intelligence and ball play. Spurs looked much more confident with him in the side. After a summer in which the club failed to add to their ranks, having Alderweireld available this season may be an advantage worth talking about. Paul MacInnesIt is hugely encouraging for a team as settled as Bournemouth that David Brooks already appears to have a good understanding of Eddie Howe’s demands. The midfielder’s performance in in the win against Manuel Pellegrini’s unbalanced West Ham demonstrated the value of dipping into the Championship and the early signs are Howe has found a big talent. The Wales international was the only new signing to start for Bournemouth at the London Stadium and the 21‑year‑old did not look fazed by his lack of Premier League experience, creating a fine chance for Callum Wilson, almost scoring twice and earning the free‑kick that led to Steve Cook’s winner. “The only surprise for me has been how quickly he’s adapted to the position because last season he was playing as a No 10 for Sheffield United,” Howe said. “We’ve used him as a wide player and he’s settled very well.” Jacob Steinberg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Find good-quality moisture-wicking clothing that won’t rub or cause issues when you start running in it for longer.Tell someone you run regularly and the chances are they will ask if you have done a marathon. Other distances are available! Training hard to improve your 10K or 5K time (or, indeed, your time for a shorter distance) is just as rewarding – and has the benefit of eating up less of your leisure time. Shorter distances also put less pressure on you – if a 5K goes wrong, you can do another one a week later. The reason the pros only do a couple of marathons a year – at most – is that recovering from a hard run of 26.2 miles can take weeks, if not months.Studies have shown repeatedly that the limits of our endurance are dictated by our heads as well as our bodies. For example, research by Prof Samuele Marcora found that cyclists in an endurance exercise presented with positive subliminal cues, such as action words (“go” or “energy”) or happy-face pictures, were able to exercise significantly longer than those who received sad faces or “inaction” words. You can practise this positive reinforcement yourself by finding a mantra to repeat in your head. Also, always break a long run into manageable chunks so that it seems less daunting.Want to get faster? Alas, there is no shortcut. You need to practise by sustaining faster speeds over shorter distances – this is the principle of interval training. The simplest way to do it is by time – for example, run faster for one minute, jog for one minute, repeat 10 times.Before you commit to a big race – particularly a marathon or even an ultramarathon – talk to your friends, family and support network. These intense periods of training can take a lot out of you, physically and in terms of time, and you need backup and to know it is not causing you – or anyone else – too much stress.It may seem like something only “proper” athletes need to worry about, but sleep – or lack of it – and poor nutrition can seriously hinder your recovery. If I had a training motto, it would be: “It’s not what you can run, it’s what you can recover from.” You do not need to go overboard on protein shakes – just make sure you get enough shut-eye and eat healthily."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cffdcba6514c9963bfa4ed2595fd5a7366b741f/0_95_4442_2666/master/4442.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c908b7cdd142c691ac5b1a88f2033c7","title":"lana del rey defends decision perform israel music universal","story":"American singer says she does not necessarily support governments in countries in which she performsLana Del Rey has defended her decision to perform at Meteor festival in Israel this week, in defiance of calls from other musicians for a cultural boycott of the country.She intended to perform “with a loving energy with a thematic emphasis on peace”, she said, adding: “I’m doing my best to navigate the waters of the constant tumultuous hardships in the war-torn countries all over the world that I travel through monthly.”The Palestine Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel issued a statement in response: “We urge you to reconsider. We doubt that you would have played in apartheid South Africa likewise, artists refuse to play in apartheid Israel.”Performing in Israel remains highly politicised, with many arguing that its military action in Palestine is egregious enough to warrant a boycott. The New Zealand pop star Lorde was criticised for booking a concert in Tel Aviv, and backed down after “a lot of discussions with people holding many views”, saying: “I didn’t make the right call on this one.” Her decision was supported in an open letter by musicians including Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel and Roger Waters, plus other Israel critics such as like Ken Loach, Angela Davis, John Cusack and more.But other musicians have, like Del Rey, defended their decision to perform. In November 2017, Nick Cave said he was making “a principled stand against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians” and complained of “a sort of public humiliation from Roger Waters and co” for those who do choose to play in Israel. Radiohead went ahead with a concert in Tel Aviv in July 2017, with Thom Yorke arguing that “playing in a country isn’t the same as endorsing its government … We don’t endorse Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America. “Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6609f1b553c0b7a58d5b69f9f886ac91f815305/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f579b35ff27231f187ec9c211ef59a7b","title":"how matteo salvini pulled italy to the far right podcast","story":"After years on the fringes of Italian politics, the populist leader of the Lega has stoked anti-immigrant panic and barged into power• Read the text version hereSubscribe via Audioboom, iTunes, Soundcloud, Mixcloud, Acast \u0026amp Sticher and join the discussion on Facebook and Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1538f3700bf387edd1a2d3c7050e2001f158e2/206_773_2336_1401/master/2336.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=539ed5550c446a11f11cf5dccd8846c7","title":"chris ashton could face premiership ban sale red card friendly castres","story":"• Full-back sent off for fighting in Castres pre-season game• RFU set to make decision after considering referee’s reportChris Ashton is facing the prospect of being banned for the start of the new Premiership season after he was sent-off for fighting during Sale’s pre-season victory over Castres last Friday.Ashton has a nervous wait to discover if he is cited by the Rugby Football Union, which is likely to make a decision on Monday, once the report of the referee Romain Poite has been considered. Video footage of the ill-tempered fixture against the Top 14 champions appears to show Ashton throw a punch at the Castres scrum-half Rory Kockott, who was also sent off for his part in the fracas. Sale’s Romanian prop Alexandru Tarus was also shown a red card in a separate incident. Even though the match – which Sale won 20-17 – was a pre-season friendly, the same disciplinary process applies as if it were a competitive match.A lengthy suspension would be a damaging blow to Ashton’s England hopes, having made the summer switch from Toulon to keep his World Cup dream alive. He won an immediate recall to Eddie Jones’s squad for a pre-season training camp earlier this month but his chances of being included in next month’s get-together would be put in jeopardy if he receives a ban. Sale, meanwhile, will be desperately hoping their marquee summer signing is available to start their season away at Harlequins on 1 September. If Ashton is cited he will face a disciplinary panel this week and his poor disciplinary record is likely to count against him, having served two lengthy bans in 2016. In January that year he was suspended for 10 weeks for making contact with the eye area of Ulster’s Luke Marshall and in September he was banned for 13 weeks for biting Northampton’s Alex Waller. Both those suspensions are a key part of the reason why Ashton has not played for England under Jones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50ed5c69d87aa3d78d22419ebbc175d88345fab5/0_0_4278_2567/master/4278.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a674c3b3cc269fc7e8aa760f7eec7b69","title":"japan basketball players kicked out of asian games after night with women","story":"Four players from Japan’s men’s basketball team have been sent home in disgrace from the Asian Games in Indonesia for spending the night with women in a Jakarta hotel.Delegation head Yasuhiro Yamashita told a news conference that the players left the athletes’ village following their game against Qatar on Thursday to eat at a restaurant where they met a Japanese-speaking local, who told them about a bar where they could meet women.The quartet, who were wearing their team uniforms, spent a couple of hours at the bar before checking into a hotel with four women, staying there until Friday morning, Yamashita added. Officials named the players as Takuya Hashimoto, Keita Imamura, Yuya Nagayoshi and Takuma Sato.“The Japan Olympic Committee decided to withdraw their accreditation and send them back to Japan early this morning. “We have a specific disciplinary code, it’s a clear breach of the code of conduct for the Japanese delegation. The athletes should be role models of society, not only in the sporting venues but also on other occasions.” Yamashita said the Japanese Olympic Committee took the issue of discipline in their team very seriously. The next Olympics will be hosted by Japan in Tokyo in 2020.“A day after our arrival here the Chef de Mission and other top officials told the athletes that they had to be role models in Jakarta,” he said. “It’s disappointing that after that instruction and encouragement, this kind of issue happened, I deeply apologise to the Japanese people as the head of the delegation.” Yuko Mitsuya, chairwoman of the Japan Basketball Association (JBA), also apologised for the incident, which she described as “disgraceful”.“As athletes representing Japan their actions were unspeakable, and there is no excuse for their indiscretion,” she said in a statement posted on the JBA website. “We do not have all the details yet, but we will conduct interviews with the players involved and report later about how they will be punished.” At the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, swimmer Naoya Tomita brought embarrassment to Japan when he was caught on surveillance cameras stealing video equipment from a journalist. He was later fined by a South Korean court and banned from competition for 18 months by the Japanese swimming federation.Japan, who won basketball bronze at the last Asian Games four years ago, beat Qatar 82-71 in their second game in Jakarta and top qualifying Group C. Their next fixture is against Hong Kong on Wednesday, with the squad reduced to eight players.“The players flew back home at their own expense,” Yamashita added. “The remaining eight players, officials and coaches will stay here to continue to play for the rest of the competition.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/036a5cb3f073542e56871d38fee1b13ec26cf86e/0_158_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31e06adcb3cd4022fc542aa9b0012274","title":"england v india third test day three live","story":"While you stare blankly waiting for the OBO to return, why not sign up to The Spin and get our weekly cricket email.So there we go - India will have enjoyed that, watching England charge in to zero avail. England bowled well, but Jos Buttler dropped the one chance they made, and they’ve an acrylic afternoon waiting for them on the other side of the break. 60th over: India 194-2 (Pujara 55, Kohli 53) The batsmen exchange singles, Pujara behind square on the leg side and Kohli to midwicket, and that’s lunch. “re: Over 54,” emails Scott Poynting, “when a Sunday school teacher used to do that, my Mum called it ‘bible bashing’.”Paging Roger Mellie and his Profanisaurus...59th over: India 192-2 (Pujara 55, Kohli 53) Rashid pushes a slider through and Pujara presses forward anticipating turn. There is not, so takes the ball on the pad but outside the line, and when it cannons the bat he’s relieved to see it pass off stump - just. Pujara then edges a single to leg, Kohli allows two behind square on the off side, and we might just have time for one more over before food. 58th over: India 189-2 (Pujara 54, Kohli 51) Joe Root will have his first bowl of the summer, which tells you plenty about how teams have batted against England. And, I guess, how well England have bowled. Anyway, Root is milked for three singles. 57th over: India 186-2 (Pujara 52, Kohli 50) Rashid has bowled pretty well without threatening much, and cedes just a single from this latest over – to Pujara, who heaves towards cover. 56th over: India 185-2 (Pujara 51, Kohli 50) Sangakkara reckons Buttler not Bairstow should be keeping, and that seems right to me - Buttler is a bonus batsman and Bairstow is one to rely on, but he doesn’t play that way. Sure, they don’t want to wind him up by taking the gloves off him, but that’s captaincy and that’s sport. Sanga also reckons Rory Burns could do a job as an opener, and as a Peaky Blinders extra. Maiden. “Student attempts at arson are one thing misguided attempts at pedagogy are quite another,” emails Edmund King. “My most abiding memory of fifth-form chemistry is a moment in the dying moments of one lesson, sometime in the eternal 90s. We’d been making hydrogen and my teacher noted casually that he’d made some oxygen with another class earlier in the day and that ‘he’d always wanted to do this.’ I was packing my bag and preparing to leave when there was a massive explosion and heat flash and I lost my hearing for about 5 seconds. When the roaring subsided I could hear my classmates cheering our now sheepishly smiling master, as pieces of his shredded lesson plan wafted about the room and teachers from adjoining classrooms ducked their heads in the door to confirm that we were all still alive. My teacher’s name was Mr Fear. I do wonder what he is doing now.”55th over: India 185-2 (Pujara 51, Kohli 50) After one to Pujara, there’s Kohli’s 50, earned via single to cover. He is so ridiculously good, rinsing this series and its apparently difficult conditions just as he rinses everything else. 54th over: India 183-2 (Pujara 50, Kohli 49) There’s not much going on here now, but after two and one to Kohli, Pujara turns a single to deep backward square and that’s his fifty. If he and Rahane are in form, the rest of this series is set up. “My father always used to tell the story of a pupil not paying attention in an (a?) R.E. lesson, was discovered day-dreaming and was beaten about the head with a copy of the bible in time with the immortal words ‘God is love’ reverberating through his brain. Education, huh?”53rd over: India 179-2 (Pujara 49, Kohli 46) It’s that time again: England are complaining about the ball. The umpires check - does that thing through which it is passed have a name? A sphereguage? – and it turns out to have been fine all along. Rashid delivers three dots, then Pujara takes a single into the covers and Kohli cuts three to backward point. The runs aren’t coming easily, but they’re coming. 52nd over: India 175-2 (Pujara 48, Kohli 43) Expecting a bouncer, Kohli chases a wide one and misses, then makes up for it shortly afterwards with a flowing push through cover. He’s quite good at cricket, it turns out, and add two more with a squarer push then four more with an inside edge. Naturally, Stuart Broad shakes his hand in congratulation, then collapses in mirth at the hilarity of it all. 51st over: India 165-2 (Pujara 48, Kohli 33) Rashid into the attack and it’s his bunny on strike, so he starts with a googly that Kohli sends to backward square for one. Then, after three decent dots, Pujara takes the width offered and cuts four. “The non-sports section of the  carried the story about Mitcham cricket club today,” emails Simon Levine, “at 333 n.o., the cricket green is the oldest in the world to have continuous cricket right up to today.

Anyway, Kohli nurdles a single into the leg side, then Pujara has two to midwicket. “As a teacher, all these tales of school-based arson aren’t making me feel any better about going to work today,” emails Mac Millings. “In fact, it’s my first day back after a long summer of preventing my own kids from tearing each other apart.Most memorable moment? 6-y-o daughter standing over her fallen 13-y-o brother, screaming, ‘That’s what you GET!’”At least you raised them to like Radiohead. 50th over: India 157-2 (Pujara 42, Kohli 31) ... it may have been, but we don’t even check because there was an inside edge. 50th over: India 157-2 (Pujara 42, Kohli 31) Broad cracks Kohli on the pad ... not out ... looked like it was going down to me ... and England review...49th over: India 157-2 (Pujara 42, Kohli 31) Kohli takes two via cover-drive, then forces what I suppose is a square cut through backward point for four. Bairstow is going for an x-ray, the ECB have tweeted - he looked in all sorts. 48th over: India 150-2 (Pujara 42, Kohli 24) Another maiden, this time for Broad. Thus are overs forced into legs. “On the subject of Anderson’s brilliance, I’m convinced he doesn’t get nearly as many wickets as he deserves because the weakness of other bowlers allows batsmen to just try to survive and see him off,” reckons David Murray. “So many of England’s wickets by lesser bowlers are due to the pressure he creates and batsmen relaxing or trying to score when he goes off: Ali and Stokes particularly have got heaps of wickets with poor balls but you hardly ever see Anderson get a wicket with a poor ball.”Stokes strikes me as that Botham-type character for whom things just happen, and the wickets at the other end was also a big perk of having Flintoff or Morkel in your team. They didn’t always attack the stumps, but they were different and brilliant to the brilliance at the other end. 47th over: India 150-2 (Pujara 42, Kohli 24) Two singles off the over. England are bowling pretty well here, but in so doing they’re ensuring that they’ll need to do so for longer. That’s pretty funny. “In my long-ago school days one was not suspended one was beaten, by all manner of instrument, canes, rulers, rolled scarfs, shoes,” emails Anthony White. “I was once plimsolled by (sir) Norman Fowler, possibly for the dreadful crime of running in a corridor, I forget. But I wonder if this has left me psychologically scarred and averse to voting Tory.”I just missed corporal punishment, though soft versions of it - the neck-grab, for example - persisted. My old fella had a teacher who would invite miscreants to “Bow your head in shame”. They would, and he would then zetz them over the top of it, with a telephone directory. 46th over: India 148-2 (Pujara 41, Kohli 23) Anderson will not come back for one more, Broad appearing for his first charge of the morning. Kohli sends his first ball through cover for one, and I’m wondering if England can use Bairstow’s injury to snatch the gloves away and force him to earn his spot as a batsman. That’s nice of me. I hope he’s feeling better. Get well soon. Etcetera etcetera. You’re a victim of circumstance! Meanwhile, enjoy the rest of today’s glorious cricket.45th over: India 147-2 (Pujara 41, Kohli 22) Drinks is extended – are extended? – while Buttler replaces Bairstow, who looks fair crook, his left hand covered with his cap so no one can see. Buttler, meanwhile, looks most enthused. Can England maintain pressure? Pujara sees away a maiden, andI wonder if Anderson will come back for one more. “Amateur,” chides Geoff Saunders. “You weren’t even trying. Back in the day, late 70s, I went on audit to a company in Stoke-on-Trent. They had a warehouse full of lighter fluid containers. A pallet of the stuff fell off the forklift and spilled lighter fluid on the floor. One guy says to the other “I bet I could throw a match on that and it wouldn’t burn”. 2nd guy replies “Don’t be stupid etc etc.” First guy, “No it only burns under pressure.” So they made their bet, and first guy throws a match on the lighter fluid. Biggest fire in Stoke-on-Trent since the war.I think unintended consequences rather than psychopathy.”Surely 2nd guy intended precisely those consequences? 44th over: India 147-2 (Pujara 41, Kohli 22) Excuse me, but I’m just having a moment watching Anderson bowl here. The over itself is unremarkable, but he’s just so ridiculously good, so much of the time you know what, it’s not exactly how good he is, but how expert he is. Meanwhile, his final delivery shoots away after Pujara leaves it, and ing to stop prevent four, Bairstow clatters his left hand and after treatment has to depart. They take drinks. “In the interests of teaching OBOers to fish,” emails the heroic Tony George, “tell them to go to bbcsport, click on ‘England v India 3rd Test - Live’ and then on ‘Listen to TMS Overseas’.I look forward to tomorrow’s requests. 43rd over: India 145-2 (Pujara 41, Kohli 21) This is turning into a decent passage of play. Stokes beata Pujara with a wide one - suddenly, he doesn’t look settled - then an edge doesn’t carry to Jennings at three. Another maiden, and if England can keep this up - if Anderson can keep going - there’s a wicket in the offing. “Go on then, I’ll bite,” says Ben Powell. “Only last night, I was ‘regaling’ my sons with the tale of how in the Lower 6th we used to fill syringes (appropriated from the biology lab) with lighter fluid, hold lit Zippos (it was that era, too) in front of them and then fire the plunger down hard to send a short lived jet of fire across the floor of the kitchens at school. But it was not this admittedly stupid teenage prank that saw me and two mates being suspended: that was for being caught in possession of a skeleton key that opened all the internal doors of the school.”That’s more like it. Though vanity forces me to add that it is only the real men who are still getting suspended in the sixth form (for more general high-spiritedness). 42nd over: India 145-2 (Pujara 41, Kohli 21) Jimmy Anderson is good at bowling. The cat sat on the mat. His first small canes Kohli on the pad not out says the umpire, and England don’t review because they rightly apprise an edge. Two balls later, he beats Kohli who plays at one just outside off, and that’s another maiden. “Interestingly, in Northern Ireland the pronunciations ‘aitch’ and ‘haitch’ are seen as religious identifiers,” tweets Ted O’Hagan, ‘Haitch’ being the Catholic form and ‘Aitch’ the Protestant. All due to segregated education of course.”Hold tight Dave Langlois, who has done the deed.Michael has beef for Bullon: “When you say ‘And by the way, speaking as a grammar pedant, saying ‘haitch’ instead of ‘aitch’ is nothing to do with grammar, it’s pronunciation – a different field” That isn’t grammar pedantry either, that is semantic pedantry.”40th over: India 142-2 (Pujara 40, Kohli 19) You’ve got to laugh. Pujara fences at one and imparts a chunky enough edge to take the pace off the ball. Buttler, moving to his left at two, doesn’t get down properly so has to go with one hand not two, and the catch is unsnaffled. Maiden. Does anyone have the TMS YouTube link, please? There are39th over: India 142-2 (Pujara 40, Kohli 19) It’s not going well for England, Kohli leaning forward to leading edge four through point. These are the only runs of the over, and the lead is a venerable 310. “Like James Whitehouse, I have two teenage daughters,” boasts Stephen Bullon. “Well, not quite like JW, just one actually. And he’s a son. Oh, and he left his teenage years behind a decade or so ago. But minor discrepancies aside, he too uses ‘’low that’ and it’s a straightforward refusal to accept something, or an expression of extreme unwillingness to do something. See also the authoritative (well, maybe not up there with OED) Urbandictionary: ‘another way of saying “allow that” which basically means “screw that”, to leave something alone.’So like ‘nice’, which used to mean horrible, it’s assumed an almost opposite meaning.And by the way, speaking as a grammar pedant, saying ‘haitch’ instead of ‘aitch’ is nothing to do with grammar, it’s pronunciation – a different field.”38th over: India 138-2 (Pujara 40, Kohli 15) Anderson slants one into Pujara, who who angles the celery to help it to the midwicket fence. Anderson responds well, of course, bringing his man forward and again defeating the outside edge. “No offence,” starts David Murray, “but surely setting fire to the floor for a joke IS psychopathic.”It wasn’t like that, sweardown. We had some lighter fuel and a lighter – it was the era of the Zippo – so were just messing about, lighting ourselves and various objects. There was no intent to damage, only to pass the time of day. 37th over: India 134-2 (Pujara 36, Kohli 15) Woakes has one keep low but Kohli jams down on it, then shives two through cover. I wonder how long England will hold Rashid back - if they wait for Kohli to ensconce, that might be a problem. Does anyone have the TMS YouTube link for today, please? 36th over: India 132-2 (Pujara 36, Kohli 13) Kohli takes one to long leg, bringing the lead up to 300, the only run of the over. “It’s ‘aitch”, not “haitch,’ chides Adrian Morris. “Grammar pedants have at it!”I agree – I was joking, and am currently have to convince my four-year-old that her nursery teachers are wrong. My mum used to work in haitch arr, and would underline the hatich in the name of anyone who spelled it for her using the incorrect diction. 35th over: India 131-2 (Pujara 36, Kohli 12) Pujara flips two into the on side, the only runs of the over. “I’ve been using variations on allow since I was about 1314 (now 23),” emails the disgustingly youthful Harry Borg. “Me and my friends have always used it to refer to something we don’t want to dohappen.”Is this the real life? Or is this just irony? 34th over: India 129-2 (Pujara 34, Kohli 12) This pitch is starting to agitate, and Anderson finds lift that attacks Pujara’s midsection - he manages to evade, and is then absolute chleansed by one which moves away. He manages to get a single next up, though, as Athers shows us Anderson’s wide grip on the ball - he doesn’t think the ball is moving in the air, so is seeking to bang it into the pitch and let natural variation do the work. And Kohli is then beaten outside off, coming forward does anyone in the world command their job as well as Jimmy-James?33rd over: India 128-2 (Pujara 33, Kohli 12) Woakes has the globe at the other end, and after three dots he serves Kohli a straight one which is easily flicked to the fence, but just gently enough to force Anderson into a reluctant chase. I hope he did that on purpose. “Having two teenage daughters constantly using the term ‘’low that’,” emails James Whitehouse. “Doesn’t it mean you don’t want something to happen or can’t be arsed? Ha, that’s me trying to be cool by watching the OBO at work.”Cool by watching the OBO? Fonzie has nothing to worry about. As far as I apprise, allow that is something one wants to occur, but it may now has developed into irony. 32nd over: India 124-2 (Pujara 33, Kohli 8) Anderson’s second ball is decent, back of a length and lifting, passing Pujara’s outside edge, and he diddles him for pace a second time two balls later. Shami and Sharma will be taking note, and Athers also reckons the pitch has quickened over the last day. Maiden.“You may not be aware,” says John Starbuck, our resident OBO historian, “but we’ve had this one before in the OBO, started by someone who sat next to Robin Smith on a train. Just dig that out, with all the associated stories, and today’s OBO topic is sorted.”Ok, let’s try another: I got to watch Robin Smith’s 167 not out because I was suspended from school for setting the science lab floor on fire – as a joke, not out of psychopathy, I promise. Send in your tales of suspension! Or arson! Here we go...Out come the players ... before the umpires. Whatever next! “The cricket ball has its nicknames - ‘cherry’, ‘rock’, and, I’ve learned today, ‘meteorite’, but what about the poor old cricket bat?” asks Mac Millings. “It is, I’ll admit, fuzzily early in my neck of the Deep South, but I can’t think of as many. ‘Willow’. ‘Celery’? Do your thousands of erudite readers (or Phil Sawyer and Ian Copestake) have any suggestions?”I’m afraid that I invented meteorite just this morning – earlier in the summer I tried a poorly-received riff asking for new synonyms. My guess is that the ball is so honoured because it’s a constant and regularly changed, whereas each batsman has his own celery. Harbhajan reckons India will bat all day if they can. That would be fairly amusing. “In light of the Indian resurgence, the best England can hope for would be a drawn series,” reckons John Starbuck. “India win this one and win or draw at the Ageas Bowl, leaving the Oval as the decider. From the general punter’s viewpoint, this has the advantage of a full set of tenterhooks. Unless weather.”An Oval decider would be great. ’Low that, as people half my age say. “I used to deliver Eddie Hemmings’ Sunday paper,” emails Richard O’Hagan, “something which I had completely forgotten about until I saw that clip. Funnily enough, he never seemed to be up at seven o’clock on a Sunday morning.”Who can beat this yarn? I once sat opposite Mike Atherton on a train to Manchester - he assured me that Lanky would win the County Championship and United would win the league. Our survey says...Email! “I think it was shameful to drop Curran after his very good performances and rush Stokes back. Surely everyone would have been better served for Stokes to wait a little? Earn his reprieve? As it is it turned out to be a very bad decision from a cricket perspective - we missed Curran as a bowler who is different, and provided no variation. Sowing and reaping. Can Stokes look Curran in the eye?”One thing I think we’ve learned is that Stokes is good looking people in eyes. And I also think he’s earned the right to his spot in the side – he’s been brilliant, he is brilliant. I’d have left out Woakes, though – for the variation, as you say, because I don’t think Woakes is ever going to make it overseas, and though he scored a ton, I think Curran is a better batsman. I’d like to see Jason Roy given a shy at Test cricket, but whether he can be chucked in at the top of the order I’m less certain – a chill at number five would make most sense. Except there’s no vacancy there and at least he has experience of facing top bowlers with the new meteorite. Otherwise, who is there? And then there’s Keaton Jennings. I feel bad suggesting it, because who wants to get after a nice lad doing his best, but he just doesn’t seem to have the technique for Test cricket - there’s less a score around the corner, more one at the other end of Hampton Court. Can he survive another failure? How many is Cook allowed? So are England looking for two openers? And who’s next? Though India are in command of this Test, it oughtn’t be so difficult to see a way for England. They have batsmen with the talent to bat time the problem is that they have only two batsmen with the application to match, and neither Alastair Cook nor Joe Root look like settling in. He was named man of the match in the second Test after making his maiden ton, but couldn’t collect the champagne because he was too young. Oh ok, go on then: here’s 17-year-old Sachin taking a blinder to get rid of Allan Lamb off the bowling of Narendra Hirwani. Nostalgia corner: those old enough to remember will find this deeply and distinctly unrelieving, but let’s go back to the first Test between these sides in 1990, at Lord’s. India need 24 to avoid the follow-on and Eddie Hemmings – Eddie Hemmings! – is bowling to Kapil Dev...Relief is a strange sensation. In the moment, there’s nothing better, but in the long run it can only be temporary because that is life, a serial not a series we’re not Columbo, we’re Pauline Fowler. Relief in a sporting sense, whether in victory or defeat,is usually associated with culmination, but at the midpoint of this match and series, relief is where it’s at. This is not simply thanks to the narcotising familiarity of an England batting collapse, but on account of a contest saved. At the outset, these looked like two evenly-matched teams: England are at home and have James Anderson India are confident and have Virat Kohli. And that’s how it looked through the first Test, but once England won that and parlayed it into a Lord’s degradation, it was hard to see a way back. In Test history, only one side has come back from 2-0 down to win a five-match series, but more than that, India’s batsmen seemed unlikely to improve their technique against the moving ball before a visit to Trent Bridge, so beloved of, er, Branderson. The summer was over. Except that it wasn’t, and it isn’t. After enduring the worst of the conditions at haitch cue, India were inserted on a track that, surprisingly, is the best of the series, and after a doddering start imposed their class. They will spend much of today making England suffer, and either this evening or tomorrow morning, will skittle them in hilarious fashion to save our series and stave off the onset of autumn. Selah!

But could they be jumping the gun?HBO’s new Watchmen series is going to make a lot of people very angry. The whole thing is loaded with red flags: it’s an adaptation of a beloved comic book, the comic book’s creator is notorious for being opposed to any adaptations of his work and the series will take several unforgivable liberties with the text. This alone should ensure that it will be greeted with more roiling, seething below-the-line fanboy spite than anything else on TV.But that’s not all. The biggest red flag is something else: the HBO Watchmen series is being written by Damon Lindelof.Lindelof is the man responsible for Lost and therefore the man responsible for the Lost finale, and therefore the man who ruined television for ever. He wrote Prometheus, so he ruined Alien. He wrote Star Trek: Into Darkness, too, so there’s an argument that he is also indirectly responsible for ruining the entire 1960s. People hate Lindelof. Specifically, they hate him for taking the things they love and flushing them down the toilet. With Lindelof at the helm, fan consensus dictates that Watchmen is going to be a train wreck.However, to present an opposing view, I will be watching Watchmen. And I will only be watching Watchmen because of Lindelof. I don’t think there’s a single person on the face of the planet who would do a better job with it.People have struggled with adapting Watchmen before. In the 90s, Terry Gilliam failed to get a Watchmen movie off the ground. Darren Aronofsky stalled, too, as did Paul Greengrass. And when Zack Snyder’s Watchmen film ended up in cinemas in 2009, it was a mess. Crucially, it was a mess because it was afraid to deviate from the source material. By sticking to the comic book as closely as possible, the film ended up being overlong and weirdly paced a mishmash of tones that worked on page, but fell apart on screen.But Lindelof isn’t making a straight adaptation. He is using Watchmen as a launchpad for his own thing. This will be a “remix” of the comic book in the same way that Noah Hawley remixed the Coen brothers for the Fargo series. It will be set in the same world, but feature new characters and storylines. And, while this is bound to inspire all manner of wounded howls from diehard Watchmen fans, my guess is that it will be the truest on-screen iteration of Watchmen yet.Lindelof soars when his adaptations move beyond canon. Take The Leftovers, for example. At the start, it was a relatively faithful adaptation of Tom Perrotta’s 2011 post-rapture novel. It was fine, but so oppressively gloomy to sit through that you could never really get excited about it. But, once Lindelof had freed himself from the shackles of the text in series two and three, The Leftovers became his masterpiece. Perrotta’s characters were still there and his book’s core emotion was left intact, but in Lindelof’s hands it flowered into something far richer and weirder.It was still a meditation on grief, but one that opened itself up enough to recognise the moments of absurdity that come with bereavement. On paper, some of the flights of fancy that Lindelof took – the penis scanner, for example, or the lion orgy – sound too far-fetched to work. But in the moment, they felt even truer to the book than the direct adaptation did. Lindelof was doodling in the margins, but in a way that honoured the source. I am certain that this is what he will do with Watchmen, too.Of course, a few things stand in his way. Perrotta worked on The Leftovers as a writer, so he was always at hand to yank Lindelof back down to earth whenever he threatened to overstep the mark, but this won’t happen with Watchmen. Moore’s presence will be felt, but only as an unseen, disapproving force. He wants no say in the direction of the series, which means that Lindelof will have to rely on his own instincts to remain moored to the spirit of the book.Second, and perhaps more important, Lindelof has to contend with the uppity possessiveness of Watchmen fans. He has already got out in front of this a little – back in May before the series was greenlit, he wrote a long essay about his history with Watchmen partly to prove his credentials and partly to prostrate himself before the fans – but he only needs to enrage the neediest of Watchmen superfans to make his life a misery. Why anyone would risk putting themselves through that is anyone’s guess.But I believe in Lindelof, and I believe that his Watchmen series will be funnier, sadder, weirder and scarier than the book. And if it isn’t? I’ll just watch the Lost finale 10 times in a row instead because you were all wrong about that as well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/359446ca9861593883152c6438aa649a53bcca98/0_560_4753_2852/master/4753.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14d798a2d02279944598141d5978bec3","title":"michael cohen under investigation for 20m bank report","story":"Federal investigators are ‘considering filing charges by the end of August’ on Donald Trump’s former right-hand man Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s former lawyer and right-hand-man, reportedly faces a federal investigation into possible bank and tax fraud relating to more than $20m in loans.The New York Times reported that federal investigators in Manhattan were reaching the end of their inquiries and were “considering filing charges by the end of August”. According to the newspaper, their focus was falling on multi-million dollar loans Cohen received from two New York banks as well as on income his family gained from the city’s yellow taxi business.Federal investigators were also homing in on Cohen’s role in arranging hush money for two women who alleged affairs with Trump before the 2016 presidential election. The pay-offs might have constituted a breach of campaign finance law, the New York Times reported.The darkening cloud of federal prosecutorial interest amid possible imminent charges are likely to substantially crank up pressure on Cohen to co-operate with the on-going investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller. That probe is reaching a critical stage as Mueller seeks to determine whether collusion took place between the Trump campaign and Russia to sway the outcome of the 2016 election.Mueller is facing mounting calls to bring his inquiry to a rapid end before campaigning for the November midterm elections kicks off. Given those demands, any charges against Cohen are likely to be brought by the end of this month or delayed until after election day on 6 November.Cohen has been drawn into the legal purview of both Mueller and other federal investigators since his office and home were searched in April. Since then he has given strong hints that he is prepared to co-operate with prosecutors in exchange for lenient treatment.In July, one of Cohen’s legal team Lanny Davis released to the media a tape in which the attorney could be heard in discussions with Trump. The two were deliberating over a $150,000 deal to buy the silence of a former Playboy model Karen McDougal to prevent her allegations of an affair emerging two months before the 2016 presidential election.According to the New York Times, federal investigators are probing Cohen’s role in arranging hush money for McDougal. They are also interested in a $130,000 payment he helped make to the adult film actor Stephanie Clifford, aka Stormy Daniels, as a possible violation of campaign finance laws that restrict undisclosed donations.The newspaper reported that the focus on possible bank fraud stemmed from the engagement of Cohen in the New York yellow cab industry. In 2014 he took out loans with two financial institutions using 32 taxi medallions owned by the attorney and his family as collateral.The story of Cohen’s alleged legal peril dropped just hours after Trump went on a Twitter rampage in which he likened Mueller to Joseph McCarthy, the Wisconsin senator who led the 1950s clampdown on so-called “un-American” activities.“We are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby!” Trump tweeted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aad58216f405abb9f36282a6140ebb5c4570d8fc/0_58_871_523/master/871.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332460f7371ead2394d35af173c68a2e","title":"kindergarten dresses children as jihadists for parade in indonesia","story":"Manager apologises for independence day march costumes and denies trying to ‘instil violence’ into childrenA kindergarten in Indonesia has been criticised for dressing girls up in black, Isis-style costumes and replica rifles for an independence day parade, with organisers forced to apologise for the embarrassing gaffe.Photos of the “cultural” parade held in the city of Probolinggo, east Java, on Saturday showed lines of young girls marching on the street wearing niqab-style black veils, carrying cardboard cutouts of guns.The head of the TK Kartika kindergarten apologised “deeply” for the costumes, expressing regret over the decision and saying they were not trying to “instil violence” in the kindergarten children.“We raised the theme of the struggle of the Prophet to increase faith and devotion to Allah,” said kindergarten head Hartatik, when asked to explain the controversial attire.The kindergarten is on the site of an Indonesian military complex, and Saturday’s parade took place a day after independence day, which falls on 17 August, in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation.Asked to explain why the kindergarten had chosen the costumes, Hartatik admitted they had pooled props from previous years to save money.The kindergarten head did not offer any explanation as to why the jihadist-style costumes had been used in previous years.Speaking at a media conference following uproar over the event, Probolinggo military commander, Lieutenant Colonel Kav Depri Rio Saransi said the parade was purely to educate the students about the “struggle of Islam” but was not intended to promote religious radicalism.“There is not the slightest bit of radicalism. I emphasise that purely there is no such thing as an element of intentionally showing the existence of radical activities,” he said, before offering a further apology.Images and videos of the parade went viral on social media in the country and hit the same day that Indonesia opened the 18th Asian Games in a spectacular ceremony in Jakarta, which celebrated the country’s rich cultural ersity.The Probolinggo parade is an embarrassing gaffe for Indonesia as it works to show its best face to the world through the huge sporting event involving 45 countries, the largest of its kind after the Olympics.News of the parade has also reached the Indonesian parliament, with House speaker Bambang Soesatyo describing it as an “inappropriate spectacle”.“Ordering children to wear black veiled costumes and carry replica weapons gives a poor perception,” he said, “Treatment like that could damage children’s ideas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/931fc86e0de7f57ddf9f5e88b0141bbb22638334/0_147_5982_3590/master/5982.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8c1dea16d86ab4bbcd874146a6d3a79","title":"russian presence divides czechs 50 years after prague spring","story":"Events of 1968 still influence debate about whether Russia should be seen as friend or foeA few times a day, an elderly Czech person will pay a visit to the photography exhibition in Prague’s Old Town Hall, which chronicles the crushing of the Prague Spring by Moscow in 1968, and complain as they leave.“‘The Russians are here again,’ they grumble to me,” said the curator, Dana Kyndrová, describing locals’ views on the thousands of Russian tourists who visit Prague each week and the 30,000 Russians who have residency permits in the Czech Republic.Tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of Moscow sending half a million troops from the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries to crush the reformist government in Czechoslovakia led by Alexander Dubček, which had been attempting to implement “socialism with a human face”.A debate is raging about whether Russia poses a strategic threat to the country today or whether relations should be improved with Moscow in spite of EU sanctions.Most politicians in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia see Russia as a threat, but the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, is an outspoken admirer of Vladimir Putin, while Slovakia was one of a handful of EU countries not to expel any Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in March, after disagreement among the ruling coalition.For some of the older generation, the anger at the Soviet Union from 1968 carries over on to modern Russia and Russians. Kamila Moučková, a television newscaster who was arrested during a live broadcast in August 1968, has said in interviews with the Czech media that even now she finds it hard to be civil towards Russians. Moučková was one of the first Czechoslovakian news anchors and became known for her critical broadcasts in 1968. She was later fired by the broadcaster and went to work in a plastic bag factory, returning to the screen only after the Velvet Revolution in 1989.“After everything the Russians did here, I am not interested in getting to know that country,” she said. “Perhaps I am too old ... to change my view. Until this day, when we play hockey with Russia I do not view it as a sport but as a political matter. I even have to persuade myself internally to behave politely to Russians when they stop me on a street to ask for directions.”After the Velvet Revolution, when Czechoslovakia finally made the transition out of communism, there was a tendency to look at the Prague Spring as merely a spat between different groups of communists. But many of the photographs on display at Kyndrová’s exhibition show how much of a national element there was in the protests.There were signs and graffiti demanding “Russians go home”, and on the Bratislava war memorial someone had drawn a logo equating the Soviet star with the swastika.Kyndrová was 13 at the time her mother was a photographer who took some of the photographs on display. “My father took me out on to the streets and said: ‘Look at this and remember it forever.’”Later she studied foreign languages, learning French and Russian – much to the irritation of her grandfather, who after 1968 did not want anyone in the family to speak Russian. She ended up travelling to Russia frequently from 1976 onwards, and has released a photography collection about Russia.“The events of 1968 still play a part in the way I think about Russia. Russians always are very friendly when they find out you’re Czech, but it’s better not to talk about history,” she said.In contemporary Russia there is still a denial about what Moscow’s troops did in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, with all the focus instead on the heroics of the second world war victory. Kyndrová said she had an exhibit planned in Moscow in 2005 called “1945-1968-1989”, exploring the different episodes of Soviet military involvement in Czechoslovakia. “But at the last minute we got a phone call and they asked to rename the exhibit ‘Russian-Czech dialogue’ and take out some of the pictures. I refused.” In Slovakia and the Czech Republic there are those on both the far left and the far right who favour improved relations with Russia and dismiss the historical grievances as irrelevant. “Think of our history with the Germans, and now we are friends,” said Jaroslav Doubrava, 70, a senator and one of the most enthusiastic supporters of modern Russia among Czech politicians.Doubrava had recently returned from a trip to Crimea, organised despite heated protests from the Ukrainian embassy in Prague. He praised Russia for “performing miracles” in the territory.Peter Marček, an independent Slovak MP who had recently made a separate trip to Crimea, said: “To me, August 1968 was the aggression of the communist Soviet Union, not a hostile act of the Russian nation.”Unlike Poland or the Baltic states, the two countries do not have a centuries-long complicated history with Russia. For many ordinary Czechs, Russia is of minimal importance. It may not be deep-seated distrust of Russia rooted in 1968 that is behind the anti-Russian political mood, but recent actions by the Kremlin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f074d8872d13a8086832ecf2a96b28f0d3a2a9da/0_13_3449_2070/master/3449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88bf33332c4c6abede7df93d2e8451b8","title":"separated south and north korean families take part in rare reunions","story":"Emotional scenes as relatives take part in first cross-border reunions for three yearsSiblings long assumed dead and parents who were separated from their children have come face to face for the first time in more than six decades as 89 families from the two Koreas were reunited in North Korea on Monday.The reunions, the first in three years, are a symbol of the painful isions that remain long after the end of the 1950-53 Korean war. Families embraced and many cried to the point of being unable to speak for several minutes.Han Shin-ja, 99, was reunited with two of her daughters, 72 and 71, both wearing traditional Korean hanbok dresses. All three were overcome with emotion as they held each other close. “When I fled home in the war …” Han began to say, before becoming too choked up to speak. The clothing, which the two countries have in common, is a reminder of their shared history, but the significance of the meeting was made even more powerful by the fact that if past reunions are any indication, this will be their only chance to meet. “Uncles, take my deep bow,” said Seo Soon-gyo, 55, as her 87-year-old father, Seo Jin-ho, met two younger brothers, Chan Ho and Won Ho.About 330 South Koreans from 89 families, many of them in wheelchairs, gathered with 185 lost relatives from North Korea, embracing with tears, joy and disbelief.The brief reunions, which will last only 11 hours, took place in the North Korean tourist resort on Mount Kumgang. The two Koreas renewed exchanges this year following a standoff over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programmes. Lee Su-nam, from South Korea, saw his brother Lee Jong-seong for the first time in 68 years. In an interview with the  before the reunion he described himself as very lucky to have the opportunity, but added: “I think there’s going to be a lot of difference, in the language, in the way of thinking, and the lifestyles we lived. I can’t ask him what kind of jobs he’s had and the troubles he’s had under the North Korean regime.”On Monday he wept so hard that North Korean staff had to console him.The reunions highlight the stark differences that remain between the two countries. South Koreans prepared gifts for their relatives, often basic necessities such as winter jackets, socks, underwear, medicine, toothpaste and food. Choco Pies, a marshmallow between two pieces of cake and covered in chocolate, are particularly popular in North Korea, and were previously offered as bonuses to workers in joint manufacturing projects.Families are discouraged from giving cash, for fear it may be taken by North Korean authorities, and the South Korean government has told its citizens to politely refuse any gifts with propagandistic overtones.The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, himself a member of a separated family from North Korea’s eastern port city of Hungnam, said on Monday that the reunions should be sharply scaled up, held regularly and include exchanges of visits and letters.“It is a shame for both governments in the South and the North that many of the families have passed away without knowing whether or not their lost relatives were alive,” Moon told a meeting with presidential secretaries. “Expanding and accelerating family reunions is a top priority among humanitarian projects to be carried out by the two Koreas.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54b3d9fcc9231610fa5f8282670ff5f43f4866dd/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2544a14984bdf7a68e417ea039f138f","title":"xi jinping calls for absolute loyalty from chinese army","story":"President’s speech seen as bid to increase control over military in face of criticismThe Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has called for “absolute loyalty” from the military in a speech to leaders of the People’s Liberation Army.State-owned CCTV devoted a third of its Sunday evening broadcast to the event at which Xi, dressed in the PLA uniform, shook hands with officers and received a standing ovation.“Strengthening the party’s leadership in the army is necessary for making China and its army powerful. The party’s absolute leadership of the army should be insisted on,” he said, according to CCTV. “We must … cast the ideological foundation of the army’s absolute loyalty to the party.”Since taking office in 2012, Xi has amassed more control over the military than almost any predecessor who also held a position as chairman of the central military commission, or head of the Chinese military.Yet, his insistence on loyalty may indicate a level of insecurity. Xi’s speech at a conference of the military commission comes amid a flurry of rumours and reports of criticism within China’s political class and intellectual circles over his handling of the economy, domestic health scandals, and a trade war with the US.Adam Ni, a China researcher and visiting fellow at the Australian National University, said: “The PLA is the final backstop to any political backlash that Xi may confront in presenting himself as absolute leader. In the end, those critical voices can only go so far because he has control of the gun.”Sunday’s speech was Xi’s first public appearance since the end of the secretive annual summer retreat of China’s most influential leaders in the seaside town of Beidaihe. Ni said: “The fact that he has to keep having these campaigns means he is encountering certain resistance within the military, that he’s feeling insecure, that he’s paranoid about his position … so he has to keep super-vigilant.”One of China’s most powerful organs, the PLA is coming under tighter control by the party. Under Xi’s tenure, both high and lower level military cadres have been replaced by those seen as more loyal to him. He has reduced the size of the military commission from 11 to seven members, concentrating power in a smaller group. And as of this month, the military has begun implementing the party’s internal disciplinary regulations over its own protocols.The regulations govern everything from how PLA soldiers use their mobile phones to their behaviour online. All social media accounts of PLA soldiers must be registered with the authorities. Xi’s presence has also been increasingly visible in military parades, exercises, and events such as Sunday’s."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3601899.1534768414!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"obama speechwriter to unveil statue of former us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCody Keenan with Barack Obama in the Oval Office, July 23, 2013. Photograph: wikipediaFormer US president Barack Obama “has gone about as far as he can” in indirectly criticising his successor, Donald Trump, according to Mr Obama’s former director of speechwriting, Cody Keenan. Mr Keenan, a seventh generation Irish American, is in Ireland following a holiday in Italy for his “first real holiday since leaving the Obama White House”. While here he is holding meetings with the Washington Ireland Programme where he is Writer in Residence. He will also attend the unveiling of a statue to Barack and Michelle Obama at the Barack Obama Plaza, in Moneygall, Co Offaly, on Monday. Asked if he wrote Mr Obama’s July speech in South Africa, delivered on the 100th anniversary of Nelson Mandela’s birth, in which Mr Obama cautioned against “strongman politics” a reference taken to be a stinging rebuke of Mr Trump, Mr Keenan said the speeches were always Mr Obama’s, his own role being just to assist. But he added the former president “has definitely spoken out and made more statements than any other ex president had to”, Mr Keenan said. Asked about Mr Obama’s future intentions in relation to criticism of the Trump administration, Mr Keenan said “I think he will take it as it comes.” He said Mr Obama had made the point that it is now “up to everybody else” in the political arena to take part, and for outsiders to “show up and vote” in the midterm elections. The midterm elections will mostly be held on Tuesday, November 6th, in the middle of Republican president Donald Trump’s term.Mr Cody also revealed the former president’s speech in Dublin’s College Green – in which he spoke positively about Ireland using the words “Is féidir linn” (yes we can) were inspired by a slogan both men saw just hours before the event, on a t-shirt in Dublin. Mr Cody said the then US president had cottoned on immediately to then taoiseach Enda Kenny’s use of an Obama speech for Mr Kenny’s own College Green address. In the original 2008 version Mr Obama said: “If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.”Mr Kenny said: “If there’s anyone out there who still doubts that Ireland is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our ancestors is alive in our time, who still questions our capacity to restore ourselves, reinvent ourselves and prosper, today is your answer.” Mr Cody said the Americans saw it as a witty homage to the US president. In Moneygall Mr Cody will unveil a Mark Rode statue of the former president and first lady adjacent to the Visitors Centre at The Barack Obama Plaza. The unveiling will take place at 1.30pm. A renowned sculptor, Mark Rode has created what is described as an intimate bronze statue. The owner of the Plaza, Pat McDonagh, said he is committed to helping ensure the story of Obama’s Irish ancestry and his connection to Moneygall village will be promoted.The plaza is managed by President Obama’s eighth cousin Henry Healy, dubbed by Mr Obama as “Henry the Eight”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3601116.1534716467!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how dev almost lost the 1966 presidential election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTom O’Higgins (top left) hailed from a venerable Fine Gael dynasty and ran an American-style campaign while Seán Lemass was pivotal in reminding voters of Dev’s patriotic credentials. Photographs: The Politics students might be astonished to learn that Éamon de Valera was re-elected for a second seven-year term as Uachtaráin na hÉireann in 1966 without making a single campaign speech.He did not personally canvass for votes, did not engage in debate with his sole opponent, Fine Gael’s Tom O’Higgins, did not comment on the issues and did not even hold a final rally.But Fine Gael leader and future taoiseach Liam Cosgrave insisted there was nothing in the Constitution, written or implied, that indicated an outgoing President could not campaign.As another presidential election looms, comparisons are being made with 1966. This was the last time the incumbent officer holder was challenged when seeking re-election.The practice of politics, the media landscape and societal issues have changed dramatically since the electorate was asked to choose between de Valera and O’Higgins. Yet, there are similarities with the upcoming contest as President Michael D Higgins is set to be opposed for a second term, just as de Valera was then.Higgins has said he will nominate himself in accordance with the Constitution and stand as an Independent candidate.De Valera did not avail of that right in 1966. He agreed to be nominated instead by Fianna Fáil members of the Oireachtas.The question now is will President Higgins stay aloof from electioneering, as Dev did, or will he embrace the hustings with the risk of the presidency being brought into discussion of Government policy?De Valera’s opponent, Tom O’Higgins, was of a Fine Gael dynasty, a TD for Laois-Offaly, a lawyer, a former minister for health and a nephew of Kevin O’Higgins, the minister for justice assassinated in 1927.He toured the country with his wife Terry, addressed 130 public meetings and took part in American-style motorcades with marching bands.Fianna Fáil confidently expected de Valera – the last surviving commandant of the Easter Rising and a towering figure in 20th century Ireland – to be re-elected unopposed in the golden jubilee year of that historic event. The party was furious when Fine Gael opposed him.Dev, who was 84 and with failing eyesight, attended many public events as part of his official presidential duties. But he refrained from making any public comments that might be construed as political.Fianna Fáil ensured, however, that his presence at many of those gatherings had the trappings of his old election rallies. Old IRA veterans, wearing War of Independence service medals, provided guards of honour and party supporters sometimes shouted “up Dev!”He travelled by train to Mallow on May 15th to attend an Easter Rising commemorative pageant with a cast of 2,000 local people at the local racecourse. The Irish Press, which he had founded, assigned two reporters and a photographer to cover the visit.The line between presidential protocol and party politics became blurred. As others formally greeted de Valera as “Uachtaráin” or “Mr President”, the veteran Fianna Fáil TD for Cork North East, Martin Corry, just stepped forward and shook the hand of his old political leader with the salutation, “welcome chief.”Supporters had earlier gathered to greet Dev at each railway station where the train stopped along the route from Dublin. Babies were held up by their parents to see the President, who spoke from the State coach, a special carriage attached to the regular train.The following day, The Irish Press began publishing extracts from his upcoming biography by Lord Longford and T P O’Neill. The series of articles illustrated with photographs from momentous moments in his long career continued over 14 issues until the eve of polling.When the President was driven to Waterford on May 28th for the conferring of the freedom of the city on William Cardinal Conway, bonfires blazed along the route while supporters carried placards, waved flags and escorted him with bands through various towns.Fine Gael, while mainly focusing on the future, did not entirely turn their backs on the past. The O’Higgins campaign began at his ancestral home in Stradbally, Co Laois, where his family’s record of national and public service was invoked.His father, Dr TF O’Higgins, brother Michael, sister-in law Brigid Hogan-O’Higgins and uncle Kevin, had all been elected to the Dáil. His father and uncle had also served as cabinet ministers. One of his great-grandfathers, TD Sullivan, was a Fenian poet and patriot.Fianna Fáil’s campaign seemed to be going well. There was an after glow from the golden jubilee celebrations of the 1916 Rising, many of which were attended by de Valera. But it was a difficult time for the government politically.Farmers were marching for better prices. And there was growing industrial unrest, continuing a pattern from the previous year when 89 disputes resulted in work stoppages by almost 40,000 people.Fianna Fáil, fearing the voters might use the presidential election to send a protest message to the government, conducted a big campaign. Ministers addressed 100 meetings and the party issued 128,000 posters, 120,000 car stickers and two million canvassing cards. It also distributed 1.7 million copies of an election manifesto.There were no significant opinion polls at that time. But the main political parties had a network of members in each parish, who were so tuned into the mood of the electorate it was claimed they could tell how people voted from the way they walked.Fine Gael’s campaign directed by Gerard Sweetnam TD, a formidable organiser, tapped into the changing public mood by highlighting “the need for a youthful, forward looking president to personify the real Ireland and what it can best contribute to modern civilisation”.It too ran a lively campaign during which it distributed more than 1.7 million copies of the O’Higgins manifesto, as well 1.25 million canvassing cards, 157,600 posters and 100,000 lapel badges and car stickers.Speeches by O’Higgins were not reported on radio or television, but normal news coverage was given to events attended by de Valera as Head of State.Fine Gael protested that their candidate was unfairly treated, but RTÉ said it had been following established election coverage practice and had not been subjected to political pressure from any source.O’Higgins, who was just short of his 50th birthday, travelled an estimated 22,000 miles around the country in five weeks, sometimes attending as many as three rallies a night.The new style campaigning was well illustrated when he toured Limerick city in a small red open sports car on May 28th, while a light aircraft flew overhead and dropped balloons with election slogans.But the old ways were not totally abandoned as both sides canvassed door to door and held church-gate meetings. Cattle sales at an open air market in Carndonagh, Co Donegal, on May 2nd were even suspended to hear O’Higgins address the assembled farmers.De Valera was odds-on favourite to win. He was revered by his loyal followers for his national leadership and long service. But the electorate was changing. Many of the old values he had espoused were being questioned as a new generation looked more to the future than the past.Nowhere were the changes more apparent than in the new ballrooms where the Royal Showband, the Dixies and the Miami were attracting large numbers of young dancers more interested in The Hucklebuck than the Siege of Ennis.Lemass assured the electorate, however, that de Valera’s re-election would be “an affirmation by the people that the aims for our country which have directed him throughout his life remain constant, and that patriotism is as relevant in the island of 1966 as it was in 1916”.But there were worrying signs for Fianna Fáil. The perceptive  political writer John Healy sensed early in the campaign that something was happening: “The Fine Gael tail is up. It is running as it has not run for a long time. It will be an interesting finish indeed.”He noted that O’Higgins, and his wife, ran the gauntlet of the aisles twice at a special ardfheis in Dublin’s Mansion House and were given two standing ovations, one before lunch and one after. The first lasted 54 seconds, the second 46.Fianna Fáil campaign director Charles Haughey, then minister for agriculture, was worried by the grassroots feedback. He called for an all-out effort by party workers on polling day to ensure de Valera would win.He also went into the Dáil five days before voting to announce a £5.5 million package of measures to boost farm income. The aid was expected but farm leaders believed the timing had to do with the campaign.Both parties mobilised thousands of cars to transport voters to and from the polling booths which were open for 13 hours in 38 constituencies with 6,200 presiding officers and clerks on duty.But glorious weather meant many people went to the seaside instead. And there were also some hints of political apathy. A sign on a wall in Kingsbridge, Dublin, read: “Arkle for President.”The turnout was 64.7 per cent, which meant 602,585 people, one-third of the 1.7 million electorate, did not vote. De Valera had just 10,617 votes to spare over O’Higgins (558,861 to 548,144), a margin of less than 1 per cent.The President said he was glad to have won his last race, “even though it was only by a short head” and explained why he had not nominated himself.It would have been mere pretence to do so, he said, noting that no person could hope to win a presidential election without the support of some organisation or party.Lemass regarded the result solely as “a tribute to a man who had given exceptional national service and an indication of the people’s confidence to fulfil the duties of the presidency in a manner which will do credit to our nation”.O’Higgins, who later became a High Court judge, a judge of the European Court of Justice and Chief Justice, wrote in his autobiography A Double Life that he felt he had acquitted himself well and had come out of the contest with his integrity intact.“The description ‘a close run thing’ used by the Duke of Wellington to describe his famous victory at Waterloo, might well have been applied also to the result of the Presidential election in Ireland in 1966,” he wrote.Fine Gael claimed a moral victory and a vote of no confidence in the government. But their supporters were tantalised by the thought of what might have been – just one extra vote in every ballot box for O’Higgins would have elected him president and caused a seismic political shock."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

the last remaining rebel stronghold - could create a humanitarian disaster. Some 2.7 million people are trapped in Idlib, which is controlled by a complex patchwork of jihadists and more moderate rebels. The UK government said it had spent £152 million pounds on humanitarian programmes in Syria for the financial year 2017-2018.Britain had increased its aid as well as supply of armoured vehicles and training to Syria\u0027s opposition in 2013.Syria\u0027s northwest is the last major region still held by rebels.The conflict in Syria has killed an estimated half a million people, driven more than 5.5 million people out of the country and displaced over 6.5 million within it.In 2011, the United States adopted a policy that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must leave power. But Washington and its Western allies, including Britain, have subsequently watched Assad\u0027s forces, backed by Iran and then Russia, claw back territory and secure his position.On Friday, the US state department announced it was cutting $230m (£180m) from its budget to stabilise areas of Syria captured from Isis, saying it had been compensated by $300m in extra contributions from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other US allies.Please review our commenting policyBritish air stewardess who fell off cruise ship says yoga and singing helped her survive 10 hours in seaChaos and missed flights at Gatwick as IT error forces staff to write flight details on whiteboardsPope calls on all Catholics to uproot \u0026#39this culture of death\u0026#39 in unprecedented  letter on sexual abuseShots fired at US embassy in Turkey amid escalating row between Nato alliesWestminster suspect appears in court charged with attempted murder in alleged attack outside ParliamentImran Khan to scrap hundreds of  staff and move to three-bed home as he pledges new austerity drive for PakistanKorean families separated by war meet for first time in more than sixty years Children\u0026#39s literacy levels fall as social media hits readingParking tickets rise tenfold to 6.4million as ministers are urged to crack down on \u0026#39cowboy fines\u0026#39Spanish police shoot man dead as he tries to attack officers with knife near BarcelonaHMP Birmingham, England\u0026#39s worst prison, taken over by Government after inmates \u0026#39seized control\u0026#39Taiwan\u0026#39s president visits Nasa space centre, in a move likely to anger BeijingEdinburgh Fringe: Joke about being fired from a Job Centre named funniest at this year\u0026#39s FestivalGreece emerges from final bailout - but \u0026#39still has long way to go\u0026#39The 8 things you might have missed this weekendOxford professor \u0026#39told to retire at 67 to allow ersity\u0026#39New earthquakes on Indonesian island Lombok kill 5 and trigger fresh panicDonald Trump\u0026#39s fixer Michael Cohen \u0026#39being investigated over $20m loans\u0026#39 as he rages on TwitterFaster broadband has delivered £9 billion boost for UK business, according to new figuresCustomers being ripped off for gas and electricity to be moved onto cheaper deals We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"imran khan scrap hundreds staff move three bed home pledges","story":"Imran Khan will forego the lavish lodgings normally used by Pakistan\u0027s prime ministers and live in a three-bedroom house with the use of only two servants rather than hundreds, he said.The newly sworn-in leader used his first address to the nation pledge a new austerity drive and rail against waste as his country faces a severe economic crisis.The former cricket hero said it was shameful that the sprawling prime minister\u0027s house had 524 staff and a fleet of 80 vehicles, 33 of them bulletproof.

In the movie, Stallworth\u0026nbsp(played by\u0026nbspJohn David Washington) manages to prevent a bomb going off at a civil rights rally, making him\u0026nbspa hero on the\u0026nbsppolice force.\u0026nbspHowever, Riley claims the event – along with may other things depicted on screen – was created for the adaptation in order to ender the audience more towards the police. “It’s a made up story in which the false parts of it try to make a cop the protagonist in the fight against racial oppression,” he\u0026nbspwrites.Riley’s alleges\u0026nbspthat Stallworth\u0026nbspwas part of\u0026nbspCOINTELPRO, a series of covert and often illegal operations\u0026nbspconducted by the FBI to disrupt political organisations, and\u0026nbsp“infiltrated a Black radical organisation for three\u0026nbspyears” to\u0026nbsp”sabotage” a group who stood against racist oppression. He\u0026nbspargues that a\u0026nbspFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) proves this and\u0026nbspthat the operations Stallworth took part in\u0026nbspworked against\u0026nbspblack causes.\u0026nbsp“Without the made up stuff and with what we know of the actual history of police infiltration into radical groups, and how they infiltrated and directed White Supremacist organisations to attack those groups, Ron Stallworth is the villain,” Riley writes.\u0026nbsp25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and Watson“To the extent that people of colour deal with actual physical attacks and terrorising due to racism and racist doctrines — we deal with it mostly from the police on a day to day basis. And not just from White cops. From Black cops too. So for Spike to come out with a movie where a story points are fabricated in order make Black cop and his counterparts look like allies in the fight against racism is really disappointing, to put it very mildly.”Riley finishes the essay by pointing out that Lee was allegedly paid $200,000 by the New York Police department to direct an advertising campaign to improve their image with minority communities.\u0026nbsp“Whether it actually is or not, Blackkklansman feels like an extension of that ad campaign,” he concludes.\u0026nbspLee has yet to comment on Riley’s essay.Sorry to Bother YouEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/20/08/adam-rowe-fringe.jpg","title":"edinburgh festival fringe best funniest jokes job centre 2018","story":"Created with Sketch.Adam Rowe wrote the gag while on stage in LiverpoolClick to followThe Independent CultureAdam Rowe, winner of the Fringe\u0027s best joke awardA joke about being fired from a jobcentre has been crowned the funniest joke of this year’s Edinburgh Festival Fringe.Adam Rowe\u0026nbspconquered the 11th annual Dave’s Funniest Joke Of The Fringe award with the line: “Working at the Jobcentre has to be a tense job – knowing that if you get fired, you still have to come in the next day.”Rowe began doing stand-up comedy in 2010, leaving behind a bar job after being named Liverpool comedian of the year in 2011.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe Independent OnlineSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/12/14/phoenix-lightning.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/12/14/phoenix-lightning.jpg","title":"uk weather latest forecast updates when sun heat returning","story":"Created with Sketch.Temperatures could reach high 20s\u0026nbsplater this week -

That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance sectors and is affiliated to the Labour\u0026nbspParty.Mr Rickhuss highlighted London School of Economics data concluding Brexit was already costing the average UK household more than £404 a year by June 2017.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table“If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table, including reopening negotiations with Europe and retaining the status quo.“Community would not shy away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in

gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/11/15/phnewclarkcityeyelevel.jpg  width= 1500  height= 846  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/11/15/phnewclarkcityeyelevel.jpg","title":"manila rubbish waves monsoon philippines city waste rubbish","story":"Created with Sketch.Footage shows tonnes of trash being swept back into coast-side streetsClick to followThe Independent OnlineWaves of rubbish crash into Manila after monsoon washes city garbage into seaMassive waves of rubbish have been filmed crashing into the shore of Manila in the Philippines after a storm burst the city’s rivers and washed several tonnes of dumped litter into the sea.Footage posted on social media shows residents and city workers struggling against a tide of debris made up of plastic, foam, clothing, deadwood and domestic waste.Trash can be seen completely carpeting the water as officials and volunteers attempt – fruitlessly – to clear it from the bay.Other clips show streams of garbage washed up in the capital city’s roads and side streets, following a seasonal monsoon.It was such a horrible scene,” said Matthew Doming, who shot some of the footage as his university club, the Bedan Environmental Philosophers Organisation, took part in the clean-up effort.In a statement posted with the video, Mr Doming, who attends the city’s San Beda University, added: “We\u0027re aware that we can\u0027t clean the entire Manila Bay in just one day and it may take years of countless effort.

Everything you need to knowThe Hajj, the five-day annual pilgrimage\u0026nbspundertaken by Muslims to the holy city of Mecca, is currently underway.The journey to Saudi Arabia results in the world\u0027s largest single gathering of people and this year began on the evening of Sunday 19 August and ends on Friday 24 August.Here\u0027s everything you need to know.One of the Five Pillars of Islam, the Hajj is a sacred duty every Muslim must undertake at least once in their lifetime (unless they are prevented from doing so by ill health or financial hardship).The Quran\u0026nbsptraces its origins to the story of Abraham, ordered by Allah to leave his wife Hajara and infant son Ishmael in the desert of ancient Mecca as an act of faith. Hajara searched frantically for water, passing between the hills of Safa and Marwah\u0026nbspseven times, but found none, only for a fresh spring to burst from the ground beneath the child\u0027s foot.Abraham constructed the Kaaba on the spot, the black stone cuboid at the the centre of what became the Great Mosque, around which worshippers walk counter-clockwise seven times in solemn contemplation of their faith as part of the Tawaf.The Prophet Muhammad later marched from Medina to Mecca, his own birthplace,\u0026nbspto rid the Kaaba\u0026nbspof pagan idols in 632, reconsecrating it in honour of Allah.The pilgrimage in homage to the miracle and its legend today serves to unite Muslims and remind all followers of Islam that they are\u0026nbspequal in the eyes of god.As such, pilgrims strip themselves of the material trappings of wealth and status and wear the plain white seamless robes of Ihram\u0026nbspto indicate their spiritual state.In addition to circling the Kaaba, pilgrims say two Rakaat prayers at the Place of Abraham, re-enact Hajarah\u0027s hunt for water between\u0026nbspSafa\u0026nbspand Marwah, drink from the Zamzam\u0026nbspWell, stand vigil at Mount Arafat and on the plains of Muzdalifa\u0026nbspand cast stones at three pillars, a symbolic act\u0026nbsprepresenting evil being driven from the hearts of men.The Hajj takes place between the eighth and\u0026nbsp13th\u0026nbspday of\u0026nbspDhu\u0026nbspal-Hijjah, the date of which alters every year by the Gregorian calendar because the Islamic lunar calendar is 11 days shorter.Eid\u0026nbspal-Adha\u0026nbspalso falls on the\u0026nbsp10th\u0026nbspday of the month. This is a Festival of Sacrifice in honour of Abraham\u0027s willingness to sacrifice Ishmael at Allah\u0027s request, a supreme act of faith, which he was prevented from having to carry out by the deity providing him with a goat to slaughter in his son\u0027s stead.Today, the same animal is sacrificed in memory of the story. It is cut into thirds: one portion is given to the impoverished, another to friends and relatives and the last retained\u0026nbspand eaten by the family.Is the Hajj safe?Two million pilgrims are expected to take part this year, thousands of whom are embarking from the UK.While the occasion is a holy one, overcrowding led to a fatal stampede in 2015\u0026nbspwhich killed over 2,000 pilgrims and Hajj fraudsters attempting to con visitors remain a real problem.“Some will arrive in Saudi Arabia to discover the accommodation they booked does not exist while others will find that their whole trip is in fact a scam set up by illegitimate travel operators that have disappeared with thousands of pounds of their money,”\u0026nbspthe politan Police have warned.Advice on staying safe includes making sure\u0026nbspyou travel with a reputable tour operator who is ATOL-protected and part of a recognised trade association such as ABTA. All members of the latter have to follow a code of conduct, reducing the risk of fraud.\u0026nbspEnsure you have all of your terms and conditions in writing and make sure your flight details, accommodation and Hajj visa are all valid, experts advise.\u0026nbspIn pictures: Muslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat for Hajj Muslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or the Mount of Mercy), where the Prophet Muhammad is believed to have delivered his final sermonA Muslim pilgrim prays as another takes a photo on the Mount Arafat Muslim pilgrims arrive at the plains of Arafat Muslim pilgrims arrive at the plains of Arafat Mount Arafat during the HajjMuslim pilgrims pray on Mount Arafat (or Jabal ar-Rahmah) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims pray by the Namira Mosque on the plains of Arafat during HajjMuslim pilgrims pray by the Namira Mosque on the plains of Arafat during HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or the Mount of Mercy) during the HajjA Muslim pilgrim wheels his children on a wheelchair towards Mount Arafat Pilgrims circle the Kaaba as they pray in the Grand Mosque of Mecca ahead of the HajjMuslim pilgrims arrive at the plains of Arafat Muslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat  (or Jabal ar-Rahmah) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or the Mount of Mercy) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims shelter from the sun under a bridge near MeccaMuslim pilgrims walk towards Namirah mosque on Mount Arafat during the HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or Jabal ar-Rahmah) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or the Mount of Mercy) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or Jabal ar-Rahmah) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or the Mount of Mercy), where the Prophet Muhammad is believed to have delivered his final sermonA Muslim pilgrim prays as another takes a photo on the Mount Arafat Muslim pilgrims arrive at the plains of Arafat Muslim pilgrims arrive at the plains of Arafat Mount Arafat during the HajjMuslim pilgrims pray on Mount Arafat (or Jabal ar-Rahmah) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims pray by the Namira Mosque on the plains of Arafat during HajjMuslim pilgrims pray by the Namira Mosque on the plains of Arafat during HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or the Mount of Mercy) during the HajjA Muslim pilgrim wheels his children on a wheelchair towards Mount Arafat Pilgrims circle the Kaaba as they pray in the Grand Mosque of Mecca ahead of the HajjMuslim pilgrims arrive at the plains of Arafat Muslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat  (or Jabal ar-Rahmah) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or the Mount of Mercy) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims shelter from the sun under a bridge near MeccaMuslim pilgrims walk towards Namirah mosque on Mount Arafat during the HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or Jabal ar-Rahmah) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or the Mount of Mercy) during the HajjMuslim pilgrims gather on Mount Arafat (or Jabal ar-Rahmah) during the HajjYou should make sure your travel insurance covers all aspects of the journey and that the appropriate vaccinations have been taken.

TV host GRILLS People\u0027s Vote spokesman in heated rowThey include Theresa May agreeing a deal with the EU as early as October and getting it through Parliament ahead of leaving day, next March 29.Other scenarios are Parliament rejecting her deal and either settling for a no-deal exit or sending her back to Brussels for more talks.Mrs May herself could declare it impossible to strike a deal so Britain leaves without one, or she might not get a deal but Parliament sends her back to negotiations rather than quit without agreement.The report says it is possible the Government or Parliament could order another referendum for voters to break a deadlock. (Image:  )But it notes: The mechanics of referendums are far from easy.Problems include that the UK does not have a comprehensive blueprint for referendums, so details have to be decided each time - probably sparking bitter political skirmishes on issues like timing and who should have a vote.Even more problematic, what would the referendum be about? the authors ask.Tory former Cabinet minister Justine Greening has suggested a three-question referendum with the choice of leaving the EU with no deal, leaving on the PM\u0027s deal, or staying in the EU.But the Institute said this raised timing issues.The UK is only guaranteed staying in on its current terms if it withdraws its Article 50 leaving application by March 29.Only an outline withdrawal agreement could be made by March and some details of a long-term deal would have to be hammered out afterwards - which the report said could see MPs agitating to have different versions of Brexit on the ballot paper.Meanwhile the Electoral Commission watchdog says six months are needed for a referendum to be well-conducted - which would probably mean the Government postponing exit day, which Mrs May has said she will not do.People\u0027s Vote campaign march to Parliament, (Image: WHEATLEYWENN)Institute for GovernmentThe authors concluded: In short, a Greening-style referendum on the timescale she appears to propose (before the UK formally leaves the EU) would only work if it produces a majority for Remain.It would not settle the issue for any other outcome.\u0026nbspBut it is not practical to ask people to vote on the arcane issues of the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp - which would come down to a fight about the \u0027orce bill\u0027.So, in practice, unless there is a clearly emerging majority (which can survive a bitter referendum campaign) for Remain, a referendum would solve nothing.

There would be no Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus or arguably Lady Gaga without Madonna.She might not be the best singer or dancer in the world, but she’s certainly the best at just being Madonna.You simply can’t imagine anyone ever telling her what to do. She’d laugh in their face.Madonna had always known how to grab attention, whether it’s publishing a book stuffed full of naked photos of herself, faking self-pleasure on stage, or kissing Britney Spears.And only Madonna could have bounced back from almost being strangled by her bright red Armani cape when she took a tumble and fell on her backside during the Brit Awards three years ago.She merely dusted herself down and carried on regardless, but I bet whoever was in charge of her wardrobe that night would have been given the b******ing of their life.Madonna is always in charge, professionally and personally. Even during her brief fling with aging lothario Warren Beatty, he was very much a bit player in the Madonna Show.That must have badly bruised the ego of a man who had always had the upper-hand in his relationships until then.It has to be said her love life hasn’t been anywhere near as successful as her career.There was a brief, destructive marriage to American actor Sean Penn in the Eighties and in 2000 she married Guy Ritchie, but the couple divorced eight years later.Since then she has dated a string of handsome and often young men, but they usually seemed to have the whiff of a photo opportunity about them rather than anything long term.She chews them up, spits them out and moves on to the next one.Madonna seems happiest as a single mum.She has uprooted the family to Lisbon, in Portugal,  because her adopted son David wants to play professional football.With her vast wealth she could easily have bought him a team such as LA Galaxy but she has always had a Calvinistic work ethic that she has tried to pass on to her kids.She has also made up with son Rocco Ritchie after a bitter custody battle and appears to be in a very good place.In an era where most young female vocalists all sound the same — bored, whiny and more than a wee bit yodelly — we really do need a one-off like Madonna.I hope she had a fabulous birthday on Thursday in Marrakech, Morocco, and danced until dawn to all of her greatest hits.Happy 60th birthday, ma’am, and I’ve no doubt you will still be in your fishnets and basques when you get that 100-year birthday message.Just when the royals and their advisers thought the whole fiasco between Meghan Markle and her dad had gone quiet, there comes a bizarre twist.Meghan’s rent-a-gob half-sister Samantha, who seethes with rage and jealousy, has announced that Thomas Markle is bringing out his own clothing range.This led to speculation as to what the brand might be called.  “Markle \u0026amp Spencer” or “Primarkles”  (thank you, Alan Carr). But joking aside, surely this can’t be a serious  concept.Apart from being a crass, money-grabbing exercise cashing in on a quasi-royal connection, who on earth would buy garments from a pensioner who dresses like a hobo?I’ve had a great deal of sympathy for Thomas  in the past. He was treated poorly in the build-up to the  Royal Wedding, when his daughter married Prince Harry.He should have been embraced by his new family and given guidance on how to deal with the  media attention.Instead he was cast adrift. The result? Those stupid paparazzi set-up photos and a series of interviews that painted Meghan in a poor light.Every time her dad talks on TV or to newspapers and magazines, her popularity is dented.The two of them obviously have a fraught relationship. It turns out Thomas didn’t attend Meghan’s first wedding in 2011 either.Thomas increasingly comes across as bitter, angry and dislikable.To gain media attention he keeps making more and more outrageous accusations.My advice would be to stop listening to his bitchy daughter Samantha and maintain a dignified silence.All thoughts of profiteering through a clothing range or any commercial activity must be abandoned forthwith.That just might mean there could be some  sort of reconciliation in the future.Otherwise he will lose his daughter forever.ONE of the week’s most astonishing stories involved a young US woman who has been given her life back with a groundbreaking face transplant.Three years ago, Katie Stubblefield, from Mississippi in the US, tried to take her own life and shot herself in the face with a hunting rifle. She was just 18.Doctors saved her life but she was left with a mass of scar tissue instead of a face.Katie, the youngest person ever to receive a face transplant, endured more than 30 hours of surgery.Of course, the operation requires a donor – and in this case it is  a very sad story.Katie received the face  of a mum who died of a drug overdose.She was a registered organ donor and her grandmother bravely approved the donation.That decision can’t have been easy and we should always salute those who are donors, and the loved ones who give their consent.Katie won’t look like anything like her donor because the “face” is moulded on to her new bone structure.She continues to heal and  make progress, but this kind of surgery is still in its infancy.She will always look “different” but she has a second chance of life and now wants to help others in anguish and with suicidal thoughts.It’s an incredible story of despair that turned to  hope.  The skill and dedication of the team of surgeons and medics that helped her is awe-inspiring.I’m always surprised to learn that Caroline Flack is 38 years old.The presenter looks a  lot younger – and at the moment she is acting like a lovesick teenager going through the agony and ecstasy of her first serious crush.Her off/on romance with red carpet fever victim Andrew Brady is becoming laughable.This week the couple apparently had yet another spat in a London ­restaurant.If these two are to have any chance of staying together long term, they need to get out of the public eye and spend some quiet time alone.I’m sure Caroline knows of a certain Love Island that isn’t being used right now. That would do very well.The ending of the second series of The Handmaid’s Tale had me shouting in despair at my TV.I don’t want to give away too many spoilers but this cliffhanger will break your heart.It also, however, sets up season three for long overdue revenge.As always, astonishing performances from Elisabeth Moss as  June/Ofglen and Yvonne Strahovski as Serena Joy.They will soon fight it out for real when the TV actress awards are up for grabs.I’ve lost track of the amount of slippers our border terrier puppy Angus has chewed up, but this week he surpassed himself by getting his paws on his Pet Passport and virtually destroying it when we were in Spain.Luckily a  local vet issued him with a Spanish version and he now boasts dual nationality.He’s suddenly developed a liking for an afternoon siesta, but at least we were able to get him back into the UK – although who knows what will happen to him after Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jeremy did not honour those responsible for the Munich killings”.Holding a wreath should not be reckoned to be any kind of endorsement of the wreath we know Jeremy deplores this kind of thing and, indeed, all other forms of wreath.Hark, though, at how quickly the approved line may shift. What was a “smear” yesterday is a forgotten truth today, airbrushed from history because, well, that’s the way these people do these things.The new line is Jeremy wants to see “a fitting memorial to everyone who died in every terrorist incident everywhere”.I dare say he’ll be visiting Enniskillen soon. Of course.And yet, in one sense there really isn’t very much to look at. Or, rather, very little that is new. This is who Corbyn is and who he has always been.He has never bothered hiding this, leaving one to assume he only does so now because there is some small, nagging part of his brain which accepts it might be sensible to do so, since failing to hide it might prove politically inconvenient.Even so, he cannot change. Anyone who has been at university will recognise Corbyn and all his fellow travellers.These were the people — some of them clever but not many of them intelligent — who fouled student politics for everyone else.The chiselling parsers and pedants and revolutionaries whose appetite for procedural minutiae bored everyone else into submission.And usually that would be that. They would, most of them, grow up eventually. But not St Jeremy and not his devotional disciples, either.They are greyer now but as instantly recognisable as they always were: Experts in room-clearing.They ought, by rights, to be confined to dingy rooms above down-at-heel pubs, where they could cut and paste their thuddingly dreary newsletters. Instead, mystifyingly, they have been given control of one of Britain’s great political parties.How much will this summer of anti-Semitism really cut through with the average voter? Less than you might think, I suspect.In the first place — and this may be a good thing — Twitter remains a niche platform and political Twitter a niche even there.Secondly, the public have already made up their minds about Corbyn and they think he’s a dud.Each month YouGov asks whether Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May seems the best available Prime Minister and each month Corbyn trails.Sometimes he is also beaten by “Don’t know”. That’s Corbyn: He can come third in a two-horse race.But, they splutter, look at what a kind and gentle and decent man he is. Why can’t other people see that he’s a valiant activist for peace?Possibly because, for a decent fellow, he spends a startling amount of time with thoroughly indecent people.He keeps falling in with the wrong crowd while never being a member of the wrong crowd himself. There is no need here to document the long list of unsavoury people with whom Corbyn has been happy to associate himself because, really, what is now the point? He is who he is and we know who he is.In Corbyn’s world every-thing has a single, simple explanation. Colonialism is the root cause of all root causes.That insight — if we can call it that — dictated his views on Ireland just as it dictates his views on the Middle East, Cuba, Venezuela and everywhere else.From there it is but a short leap to the kind of deluded wishful thinking that animates what passes for his thinking. Once you have assumed that Northern Ireland should not exist, you absolve yourself of any and all need to think about what should happen next.You may ignore the inconvenient, and stubborn, reality that Northern Ireland — like, well, Israel — does exist and is not going to disappear.Practical politics means wrestling with things as they are, not as you think they should have been decades previously.But if you start with the theory, you may avoid practical reality. If this leaves you with nothing — precisely nothing — useful to say then so be it. You will at least remain pure in heart.If this means you are no kind of “peace campaigner” at all, that’s fine too, because you will be shielded by your own impenetrable sanctimony.As poses go, this is an awfully comfortable one but it’s not serious politics.Perhaps Corbyn really is just unlucky. But it seems more probable that he’s not. And that, far from being the decent man of legend he’s actually thoroughly indecent.The only possible alternative is that he’s thunderously, crushingly, toe-curlingly thick.On balance, however, it seems more probable that he is, in fact, both.Enough of this. Enough, already.GOT a story? RING The Sun on 0207 782 4104 or WHATSAPP on 07423720250 or EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Those who have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Many people are deeply sceptical about the tedious stumbling blocks that have bogged down the process.Almost half — 48 per cent — think the political classes are deliberately making heavy weather of Brexit in the hope it will convince the public to change their minds.Six in ten believe the EU is out to punish the UK by refusing to compromise in talks on trade and free movement, our Deltapoll survey says.But the vast majority are convinced a departure deal will be hammered out in the end, even if it takes longer than expected.Former Cabinet minister Priti Patel last night said: “The Sun on Sunday’s poll shows that the British people ultimately believe we can build a stronger future for our country outside the EU.Nearly half of adults believe the weather goes in cycles and that heatwaves come around from time to time.Barely a third of voters believe the human race is responsible and that we will have more extreme temperatures unless we act soon.Our poll found that a majority of 18 to 24-year-olds blame global warming for the hottest British summer since 1976.But in every other age group, most people think it has little or nothing to do with climate change.Six in ten over-55s believe it was “just another hot summer”.“It is clear that most people are sick to the back teeth of being ­bullied by the EU and listening to politicians at home erecting all kinds of obstacles to prevent them honouring the referendum result.“The Government should sit up and heed the results of this poll. That means being tougher in negotiations with Brussels and doing what the nation voted for — to get Britain out of the EU.”Most people — 55 per cent — are against a second in-out referendum, according to our poll.Forty per cent think we should just leave in 222 days’ time as planned with or without a deal.Fifteen per cent want a vote on the final deal, but not a re-run on whether or not Britain leaves the EU.Overall, only 13 per cent have changed their minds on Brexit since the referendum on June 23, 2016. Most of those were once Remainers. Fifteen per cent of them admit to having shifted their view — equivalent to 2.4 million people.That compares with just 11 per cent of Brexit backers, 1.9 million, who have had a rethink.Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the poll had “nailed the lie” that many people regret voting Leave.Deltapoll director Martin Boon said the findings show most people are taking a tougher stance on Brexit.He added: “Half the public believe themselves to be under siege from the political classes trying to change their minds.“But the message they are sending back is that they haven’t changed their minds and the likelihood is they won’t.”Voters are evenly divided on whether there will be a hard border after Brexit. Twenty-two per cent say there will, 21 per cent say otherwise.There is also a split over whether leaving the EU will prove a historic mistake. Forty-four per cent think it will, 30 per cent believe it will not. One statement united 59 per cent of voters — “I’m really bored by Brexit.”Separately, our poll found that most people think former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was right to raise the difficult and sensitive issue of women wearing burkas. Two-thirds believe he was right to start a debate about the Muslim veil.But some say he should say sorry because he went “over the top” by comparing wearers to “bank robbers” or “letterboxes”. Half of Tory supporters and 36 per cent of all voters believe his remarks were right and he has nothing to apologise for.A further 28 per cent say he went a little too far with his language and should admit it.He gets no support from 23 per cent, who say his remarks were offensive and he should say sorry.Deltapoll interviewed an online sample of 1,904 adults aged 18+ from August 14 to 16. Results have been weighted to the profile of all GB adults.The Labour leader has defied the odds after damaging revelations about the friends he keeps.Half of voters believe Labour has a problem with anti-Semitism. More than a third say Mr Corbyn is part of that problem.But a Sun on Sunday Deltapoll has Labour three points ahead of the Tories.If there were an election tomorrow, Labour would be 31 seats short of a majority but with enough MPs to form a government with Scottish Nationalist support.Tory backing has been sapped as traditional supporters switch to Ukip in protest over the PM’s weak handling of Brexit.There is little to celebrate for any of the party leaders who all get negative popularity ratings.Mr Corbyn scores minus 35, while Theresa May is on minus 26 — only two points better than floundering Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable.Today, a Sun on Sunday poll shows that idea to be total codswallop.Voters simply want our politicians to get on with delivering Brexit.The majority of people have not changed their mind since the referendum.Our poll shows those that have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Project Fear has never worked, and it is not going to suddenly start working now. The public are wise to it.Our poll makes it clear that fudging Brexit would unleash serious anger among the electorate. The Government should take notice.Almost half of voters already reckon that the political classes in Britain are making heavy weather of Brexit, in the vain and misguided belief that they can get the public to change their mind.Meanwhile, the drop in support for Theresa May in the polls and Ukip’s rise is a further indication of what the public thought of her Chequers proposals.Millions more will abandon the Tories if Brexit ends up being fudged.Remoaners and Brussels have done their best since the Leave vote to make us think we made a terrible mistake and that the cards are stacked in the EU’s favour.Well, today’s poll is clear.We didn’t and they’re not.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even those of us who will never hit the big time have an Instagram audience waiting to “like” our every selfie.So this is just the logical next step towards making cosmetic surgery available to the masses, rather than the few.Some have argued that Superdrug Botox is actually a good thing, because it bridges the gap between the elite Harley Street options — where you pay several hundred pounds for an appointment with an “aesthetic doctor” — and the more backstreet treatments carried out by hairdressers with just a few hours of training.I disagree. Being able to buy a syringe or two of Botox when you are out shopping for your hairspray legitimises — and normalises — the act of injecting poison in your skin in the name of beauty.Being able to buy Botox over the counter, so to speak, makes it seem like no big deal — just another tick in the “maintenance” box, and as reasonable as tinting your lashes or getting your ears pierced.And that is the problem. All decisions we make about our appearance boil down to personal choice. And if it makes someone feel better to tinker cosmetically or surgically with their natural looks, that’s their choice. No one should judge them for it.But there is a wider problem.Increasingly, women think that whatever they look like naturally isn’t good enough. More and more, the “solution” is invasive cosmetic enhancement.A mainstream shop making Botox available for less than 100 quid is surely only going to add to the pressure some women feel to change their appearance using more than just make-up.Superdrug presents itself as responsible because it will refuse to treat under-25s, when other clinics will.That is shocking — not so much that some clinics WILL treat under-25s but that anyone so young could think they need Botox.You can’t blame Superdrug for this epidemic. It is simple supply and demand.The question is: Why the growing desire among women to look frozen?It’s not like you can get away with saying you’ve not had it when you have, because it’s so obvious.I’ve got a friend whose husband jokes that she needs to hold up little signs saying “happy” or “angry” when she feels an emotion, since her face is so paralysed by botulism.While I’m a big believer in your body, your choice, I’m also a believer in scratching the right itch.The truth is if you feel good about yourself, you look good. If you feel bad and lack confidence, nothing, no amount of Botox or fillers, will ever change that.Just look at Meg from Love Island, above, who, even after an estimated £40,000 worth of plastic surgery, is still massively insecure.Because it’s not what’s on the outside that counts, it’s what’s on the inside.The problem is our society tends to give far too much weight to the outside. That is especially the case for women, but increasingly for men, too.I realise all of this is easy to say, harder to act on. I’m as susceptible as the next person to comparing myself with ­others more beautiful — and possibly more airbrushed — and finding myself lacking.I’m just glad that, when that happens, I know the thing that will make me feel better is far more likely to be self-acceptance than Botox.After all, if you tighten a prune you don’t get a grape — you just get a tight prune!So the really big question is, how to achieve self-acceptance when we are surrounded by all these images of perfection?Well, we are all on our own journey with that one but I’ve got some suggestions which might help.The first is to focus on what you have, rather than what you don’t. And the second is to never, ever compare yourself to anyone else.Forget Botox, you can have that advice for free.You’re welcome.We all enjoyed cheering on the Three Lions players that would quickly become our heroes during the World Cup in Russia this summer.Sadly, those heady days are over and we were reminded of the seamier side of sport this week with the arrest of England rugby union ace Danny Cipriani.His embarrassing brawl outside a Jersey nightclub came hot on the heels of England cricket’s Ben Stokes’ trial over his clash with two men during a night out.Stokes was cleared, but what links these sorry sagas is our drinking culture, which dictates that consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is a normal way of letting off steam.Sportsmen are supposed to be role models, as they influence young people and need to keep themselves in good physical shape.But as long as we think it is OK to binge and push our bodies to the limits rather than sip a few drinks, then violence, injuries and stupid mistakes will continue to be a regular feature of our nights out.And if you are an England sports star, then public shame is just one of the tragic consequences – along with the end of your career – that you might have to face.Why should anyone be surprised at the news that sexual harassment in the police force is rife?Let’s face it, it happens everywhere. So why should the police be any exception?I thought they might hold themselves to higher standards. But no.A new survey reveals that dirty jokes, inappropriate touching, leering and being pressured to have sex are daily issues for many police staff.In a survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland, half had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague.Shockingly, one in five had also been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.Our head of police at West Ham is a woman.She is smart, tough, brave and would never put up with this type of behaviour.Part of the problem is that many women accept these actions as “normal” and don’t even know how to object. We must learn to stop putting up with it.But it is much more important that men learn what is OK and what is not.End of.Jacinda Ardern – the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has continued to work since becoming a mother in June – was criticised this week for “using her baby as a prop” after she was seen breastfeeding her daughter at a public meeting.I guess whoever coined that phrase has never had the experience of looking after a baby who needs to be fed – right NOW.Nor will they have dealt with the very loud consequences of that failing to happen.Instead, what about congratulating Jacinda on doing such a great job of being a working mum?We said farewell to two legends last week, let’s remember them with this wonderful meme....So interesting that the day after A-level results arrived, more than 26,000 university places were still available.An Ipsos Mori poll found that while most students still think university is “important”, that is down from 86 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.Since a degree is expensive – and no guarantee of a job – you can see why people are questioning the validity of one.However, there is no viable alternative.There are just 10,000 degree-level apprenticeships available, compared with 300,000 university places, according to Sir Peter Lampl, of the Sutton Trust.We need to think how we prepare young people for work and we need more technical qualifications at degree level that offer the chance of a bright future.GOT a story?

We didn’t and they’re not.DEFENCE Secretary Gavin Williamson was right to stand up to France after they tried to bill us £2million for helping them stamp out a jihadi insurrection in Mali.Mr Williamson reportedly threatened to ground our choppers in retaliation.

I was starting to think I was going to have to go back home to my long suffering and much more sensible wife and explain why I had been back to the Wondiwoi mountains and not found anything.I was really rushing around. I couldnt quite get the photo. I was thinking calm down, this is a really, really rare species, it might be the last one.I needed to steady my hand and lean on something, but the thing Im leaning against is covered in spines.But I was also thinking I could be coming home with a lot of photos of a lot of leaves.I was thinking to myself I have to be careful here and not fool myself, but I went through my mental check list of their features and realised hang on, this has absolutely got to be the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo.I felt like Captain Ahab if he had got photos of Moby Dick.Michael plans to return to the near-impenetrable mountainous rainforest next year with conservationists, experts and camera traps to find more.He also plans to apply for permits to allow him to bring back poo samples which experts have already offered to DNA match with the 1928 skeleton currently housed in Londons Natural History Museum.He flew from Gatwick to Indonesias capital Jakarta last month, followed by an internal four-hour flight to a town called Manokwari, then he took a ferry to Wasior.He recruited a hunter turned guide Martin, interpreter Norman and four porters, and they bought enough rice, noodles, sardines and chili sauce to last two weeks.Michael had visited the same region a year earlier to look at rhododendrons and orchids and the team trekked up Mount Wondiwoi to a camp they had previously created at 700m.Battling through bamboo thicket with machetes, they cut further to 1,300m where they formed a second base camp using logs, tarp, sacks and nails.They spent the following days exploring the mountain to look at orchids but they reached 1,700m they spotted the tell-tale claw marks at the base of trees.A few expeditions have returned to the region - but it remains largely untouched and unexplored due to the remote location and impenetrable thick vegetation on steep slopes.We started to see these claw marks at the base of tree and even I started to think hang on, said Michael.We were in the same area and we started to smell this funky scent and saw tree kangaroo poo.On the last and seventh exploration day they were returning to camp when eagle-eyed Martin spotted a tree kangaroo on a branch 30m up, on July 31.They surrounded the tree and stood in silence for 30 minutes while Michael snapped using an £80 second hand long lens, in the last minutes of dwindling sunlight.Tree-kangaroos are small animals which inhabit tropical rainforests in New Guinea.Most species of tree-kangaroos are considered endangered because of hunting and their habitats being destroyed.The Wondiwoi tree-kangaroo is the rarest having only ever been seen in Indonesia, once, 90 years ago.Michael Smiths pictures are the first time the animal was caught on camera.Experts agree the creature in the photo appears to be the 1928 Wondiwoi tree kangaroo - with yellowy fur, with a short tail, wide face and broad paws - which is housed in the Natural History Museum.There are other tree kangaroos in Indonesia - but they live at lower altitudes or in different mountain regions, and are a different colour.Basically we found the animal the last half hour of the last day we had available to search, and even that was because I decided to go down all in one day rather than two as planned."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000427551688.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"humpback whale high fives diver as they swim together in incredible photographs","story":"The majestic giant was also snapped extending it flipper and rising out of the ocean to peek at the explorers boat.Sydney photographer David Edgar was on an expedition in Tonga, located in the South Pacific, when he snapped the interaction with the mammal.Daivid said: “The photos came from a two to three-hour encounter with an extremely playful adolescent male.“The whale came right up to the boat and would spyhop – which is swimming vertically and sticking his head out of the water to look at us.“A group of us got into the water and, within moments, the curious whale was circling around us and swimming right underneath us to get a good look.“He did this for about half an hour as our group bunched together tightly in the water, basically staying in the exact same spot.”The inquisitive whale amazed David with its willingness to interact.The photographer added: “He’d gently place his pectoral fin out in front of us, and just leave it hanging there as he swam around us.”Despite weighing up to 40 tonnes and growing as long as 60ft, Humpback whales are remarkably agile.They are known for their underwater wailing -

These wonderful guys rescued me.Several passengers today told The Sun Online that she had a row with her partner earlier that evening.One said: My wife and I had a cabin just above hers at the back.When the incident was reported by the Captain at 0600, he said that an area in the middle of deck 7 had been sealed off.Do you know Kay Longstaff?

I think they wanted to know whod been serving her.Her (partner) was looking for her for hours before the alarm was raised that shed gone overboard.A third person said Kay and her partner were arguing, adding: This is what (the) concierge told us willingly.Meanwhile, a rescuer has revealed how Kay told them how she survived 10 hours in the sea.They said: She said the fact that she practices yoga helped her as she was fit. And she said she was singing to not feel cold in the sea overnight.She is believed to have fallen overboard around 60 miles south of Pula shortly before midnight last night.Photos show the Norwegian Cruise ship has safety railings designed to prevent people from falling overboard which are around four feet high.The edges of the ships are also closely monitored by CCTV cameras. Its not clear at this stage if Kay fell or jumped.She was found at around 9.30am this morning local time (8.30am UK time) around a mile from where she vanished and was lifted to safety.Wearing just denim shorts and a top, Kay plucked from the 20C water by coastguards and taken on board a rescue boat.Asked her name and where she was from by reporters, she replied: Kay... from England. She was treated by medics and taken to hospital in Pula where she was kept for monitoring by doctors.A hospital official confirmed: The British woman was brought to the hospital and her life is not endangered.Croatian authorities are set to examine CCTV footage from the ship amid reports the alarm was raised after she left her bag and passport on deck.It is understood the Brit, who was said to have signs of hypothermia when found, was later reunited with her family, who were also on the liner.Friends of Kays have now taken to social media to wish her well.One wrote: Omg so pleased youre OK and youre strength got you through that horrid ordeal... bless you... so pleased you are ok darling xxxxxx.Another wrote: OMG Kay! So glad youre ok I couldnt believe my eyes xxx.SEA survival expert Mike Tipton said last night Kay was lucky to have plunged into warm water.He added: “It would have been a pretty frightening experience but everything that needed to be in place for her to survive was in place. It was warm water and it was flat, calm water.“The survival times are usually one hour in five degrees, two hours in ten, six in 15.“But as soon as you get to around 20C then you can predict survival up to about 25 hours.”Mr Tipton, co-author of Essentials of Sea Survival, went on:  “Being female she is going to have about ten per cent more body fat than a man so she is going to be able to float.”He added: “The  luckiest thing was they were able to find her. It really would have been like looking for a needle in a haystack.”Kay said she was “sitting at the back” when she fell from the ship at about 11.45pm on Saturday.Croatian Ministry of Maritime Affairs spokesman David Radas said: “Our rescuers were in touch with the Norwegian Star’s crew and by checking  CCTV knew the exact moment she fell in the water.He also told The Daily : After they found her the rescued woman was not injured, just exhausted, hypothermical and in shock.When they reached the coast she felt pretty much recovered. That was also confirmed the hospital staff after they conducted preliminary health check.A spokesman for the cruise company said: A report was made that a guest aboard Norwegian Star had gone overboard while the ship was returning to Venice.As soon as the report was made the ship began a search and notified the appropriate authorities.The ship will be delayed on her return to Venice.Ship captain Lovro Oreskovic added: The British woman was exhausted when we pulled her out of the water.Luckily for her and for us we have located her at the open sea.She was raising her hands and waving when she noticed the ship, it was a real miracle that she survived not only the fall from 20 metres but spending 10 hours in the sea. That is a rare case.On a cruiser they thought she did not survive. But obviously she was fit and has made it. We were extremely happy for saving a human life.The Foreign Office is understood to be in contact with Croatian authorities over the welfare of a British national rescued at sea."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000020701603.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"one in five brits do not know europe is a continent study finds","story":"Researchers found two thirds have no idea the world is made up of seven land masses, with one in four wrongly believing there are only five.And three per cent - or the equivalent of 1.5million people - even think Great Britain is its own continent.Another one in four don’t know Antarctica is home to the south pole.The poll was commissioned by British Airways Holidays as A level and GCSE students receive their results.But despite 63 per cent of adults describing themselves as ‘well-travelled’, visiting an average of nine countries each, just one third reckon they would pass GCSE geography if they were to take the exam now.The study also found 54 per cent of Brits admit their knowledge of world locations, capital cities or landmarks is ‘ok’ or ‘poor’.Almost one quarter think the most commonly spoken language in Brazil is Spanish, rather than the correct answer of Portuguese.And one in four are unable to name the Sahara Desert as the largest hot desert in the world.Sixty-three per cent have no idea there are 50 stars on the US flag and more than one in 10 struggle to name India as the home of the Taj Mahal.And one tenth also think the Canadian city of Toronto is a US state and the same number pin pointed Athens as the home of the famous Colosseum instead of Rome.But when it comes to capital cities, Brits do a little better with 78 per cent able to identify Copenhagen as the capital of Denmark and 85 per cent correctly naming Washington D.C as the US capital.The research polled 9,000 adults from 13 countries, including the US, France, Germany, Russia, Brazil and Australia.One in four Australians struggle to name the Colosseum’s home as Rome, while almost one in five of French respondents and one in 10 Italians aren’t aware their home countries are part of the Alps.Only 54 per cent of Australians correctly said Budapest was the capital of Hungary, whereas UK based respondents fared better with 66 per cent selecting the correct answer.Six in 10 Germans could name India as the home of the Taj Mahal, yet a third of Russians don’t know Brazil’s language is Portuguese.Claire Bentley, Managing Director of British Airways Holidays, said: “We all know most love to travel and our holidays are often one of the highlights of the year.“But it’s unsurprising that Brits scored highly when asked to pick out capital cities. “With the number of city break destinations growing and packages starting from £99, weekend breaks are hugely accessible.“New destinations are opening up all the time, the web has made the world more accessible, and with our extensive route network there’s always more to explore and more ways to broaden your geography knowledge.”Travellers can learn more by exploring British Airways’ interactive map here or test their knowledge by taking the test themselves."},{"url":null,"title":"stunned tourist films 20ft strange looking something lurking in loch ness","story":"A video posted by the unnamed person purports to show the legendary creature poking out of the waters of the loch.Went to the beach Loch Ness for a day out as the weather was lovely so I thought Id make the most of it,” explained the YouTube poster.“I lay back sunbathing with a friend on the beach, having lots of laughs.“Then as the day went on, we looked at the water and saw something unusual.“It looked about 20-feet long and kept going up and down, so I turned my camera video.“We couldn’t believe what we were seeing!

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have courses that are more demanding and exams that are more searching. And yet the results could be said to coming out better. More people seems to be getting these grades than I was expecting.While the number of students receiving 8s is higher than perhaps expected, fewer than 1,000 pupils are expected to get Grade 9s, about 0.2 per cent.Students achieving lower rankings could suffer most from the tougher system.Pass grades (4 and above) fell slightly in Maths and English last year, while results showed that slightly older GCSE students, aged 17 or above, struggled with the new exams.A Department for Education spokesman said: Our new gold-standard GCSEs dont just raise academic standards but the new grade 9 provides stretch at the top end of the ability range to recognise and reward truly exceptional performance."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AD-PIC-Sink-Hole2.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=720\" height=\"960","title":"sinkhole swansea south wales car craig y nos castle","story":"Castle assistant Karen Davies, 54, found her Fiat Panda had sunk bonnet first into the ground after finishing her shift at the attraction.Son Luke, 30, said Karen parked in her usual spot but was later told by colleagues about the sinkhole.He said: She was in shock and at first she thought it was a joke.The car was upside down.

The government insists there will be no additional cost to the taxpayer.Under the contract, G4S is liable for any additional costs where there has been a forced \"step-in.\"G4S has welcomed the move.The notorious prison, which was the scene of rioting in 2016, has been issued with multiple improvement notices this year.In March, one notice related to concerns about high levels of violence, low levels of activity and cleanliness.Most recent figures show that Birmingham had the largest volume of assault incidents of all prisons in the 12 months to July 2018, with a total of 1,434.In July, the prison was graded \"poor\" in all four categories: safety, respect, activity and resettlement.The urgent notification notice was the first issued for a prison run by a private company and it requires the government to formulate an action plan within 28 days to make improvements.Today\u0027s measures include::: Putting in place a new governor to lead the prison, which Sky News understands will be Paul Newton, the former governor of Swaleside prison. He will also have a new senior management team.:: Allocating experienced HMPPS officers to bolster existing staffing at the prison.

Private prison giant G4S has been stripped of its contract to run squalid HMP Birmingham after one of the most shocking inspections ever seen. Rats and cockroaches ran free in the jail as blood, vomit and excrement lay unattended and fearful staff locked themselves away in their offices. Chief Inspector Peter Clarke called for an independent inquiry - declaring there had been a dramatic deterioration after the worst UK jail riot for 20 years in 2016. Mr Clarke blamed austerity after Tory ministers slashed 7,000 officers - only to rehire 2,500 amid safety fears - and said the contract between government and G4S has failed. Yet arrogant prisons minister Rory Stewart claimed there were many reasons for the explosion in violence.  From today the Ministry of Justice will run HMP Birmingham for at least six months, and longer if conditions do not improve. Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon said: This should be a nail in the coffin for the flawed idea of prison privatisation. So as the political debate rages, what did the report actually say? We\u0027ve looked at some of the most appalling findings. 1. \u0027Fearful\u0027 prison staff lock THEMSELVES away  Fearful prison officers are frequently hospitalised and lock themselves away in their offices in the clearly unsafe jail. Many staff were anxious and indeed fearful as they went about their duties, the chief inspector said. Wings were poorly supervised and prisoners routinely disregarded rules, even to the extent of open drug use. On more than one occasion we found groups of staff who had locked themselves in their own offices. We were told this was to prevent them, when busy, from being distracted by prisoners – an explanation that was neither plausible nor acceptable. 2. Urine and excrement are flung through cell doors  Inspectors found some prisoners were refusing to emerge from their cells for 24 hours a day due to fear of violence. Even while they were inside, other inmates squirted urine or threw excrement through broken observation panels in their doors. One distressed inmate said repeatedly they stole my mattress three days after the theft. Another clearly troubled man suffered appalling bullying when inmates adorned his door with the slogan Say No to BO and soaked him with a fire hose. Three inmates have killed themselves in the last 18 months and three more died from suspected \u0027new psychiatric substances\u0027 like Spice. Although probes are ongoing, there are significant concerns about the standards of care for those self-harming.  Communal areas in most wings were filthy, the report said. There were widespread problems with insects, including cockroaches, as well as rats and other vermin. We saw evidence of bodily fluids left unattended, including blood and vomit. I saw a shower area where there was bloodstained clothing and a pool of blood that had apparently been there for two days, next to numerous rat droppings.  Many cells were cramped, poorly equipped and had damaged flooring or plasterwork. Most toilets were poorly screened, many were leaking and we saw cells with exposed electrics. Inspectors said virtually every window was broken or missing in the older part of the Victorian jail and vulnerable inmates were placed in squalid cells. By mid-August, work to replace windows still hadn\u0027t begun. Within a matter of weeks many prisoners will be forced to use blankets, towels or clothing to keep the cold out, the chief inspector wrote. 4. The cannabis fumes are so strong the inspector felt it  For the first time in his career, Mr Clarke said the blatant cannabis fumes were so strong he could feel the effects of the drug. One in SEVEN inmates had developed a drug habit - since arriving at the jail. We saw many prisoners under the influence of drugs and the smell of cannabis and other burning substances pervaded many parts of the prison, Mr Clarke said. I have inspected many prisons where drugs are a problem, but nowhere else have I felt physically affected by the drugs in the atmosphere – an atmosphere in which it is clearly unsafe for prisoners and staff to live and work. He added: When inspectors at one point raised the fact that drugs were clearly being smoked on a wing, the response from staff was to shrug. 5. An arsonist torched nine cars DURING the inspection week  Today\u0027s report paints a picture of a jail where inmates, not staff, were in control. Many violent inmates did not even face sanctions leaving them free to commit a reign of terror with near impunity, the inspectors said. That included an arson attack on a supposedly secure car park - destroying nine staff vehicles in the same week inspectors were there. We observed a prison where control was tenuous, Mr Clarke said. Accounting for prisoners was poor, with wing staff often not knowing where their prisoners were at any given time. In at least one case, a prisoner who had been removed from a wing where he had been intimidating others managed, inexplicably, to find his way back to the same wing.

The dozens of messages left Charlotte Kendall so terrified she didn\u0027t want to leave her house for three weeks - and when she did, her mum escorted her. The 20-year-old first met Terry Waymark, 36, when she served him a \u0026pound2 portion of chips during an evening shift at work. But after taking a business card off the counter for her animal portrait company, he began to relentlessly text, call and email her. Waymark asked her on dates, called her late at night and constantly asked to meet up with her – threatening he would return to her workplace if they didn’t.  However, Charlotte eventually went to police when he texted her to say he knew she had been on holiday to Cornwall for four days. Just one day later, police pounced on menace Waymark and he was found guilty of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. He was jailed for four years and given an indefinite restraining order at Portsmouth Crown Court. Now with her stalker - also a convicted arsonist - behind bars, Charlotte, from Portsmouth, hopes her story will encourage other victims not to suffer in silence. The brave young woman, who is due to study veterinary nursing at university soon, said: It was constant. It didn’t seem to matter if I replied or not as the texts just kept on coming. “He was constantly asking if he could phone me but I made it clear we could discuss everything over the email and texts. “But then he asked whether I had kids and if I was single.  “I instantly sent a text back and asking why my current relationship status would affect the portrait. “Then he was asking if he could take me out sometime as ‘he knew a lot about me’. “Then he mentioned he would drop off an iPhone 6 at my work so we could talk. “I was freaked out. “Then he asked if I worked in the chip shop and if I had gone away to Cornwall and that’s when the penny dropped. “I realised Terry was the customer who mentioned he was a police officer. “I’m just glad we’re all safe and he’s locked up. If I hadn’t gone to the police when I did who knows how far he would have gone? “I still work in the chip shop as I’m putting money aside for university.  “But I’m more reserved with customers now. I just keep it to the basic ‘hello’ and ‘thank you’ as I don’t want to go through that again. “But hopefully what I’ve been through will encourage others to report potential stalkers. Charlotte first met Waymark while working an evening shift at her local chippie in Leigh Park, Hampshire in October last year. Impersonating a local police officer, he lingered around the takeaway asking questions for 30 minutes before politely being asked to leave. She said: “It around 8.30pm on a typical Thursday when Terry walked in asking for a \u0026pound2 portion of chips. “I noticed he was a new face as I’ve worked there four years and know who all regulars are. “He introduced himself as a local police officer which at the time I thought was an odd thing to do.  “I don’t know anyone who goes around shouting about their job willy-nilly. “He didn’t mention his name but kept going on and on about his job. “He was going on about the murder rate and how much of a dangerous area it is. “Then it was a bit more light-hearted and he asked if I lived in the area and how my day was going. “But he was looking at me square in the eye. It was just intense. “Usually customers only wait around if they’re waiting for their fish to be battered but he was just there with his chips going cold.  “My boss had to come over and tell him we were closing to make him leave.” In what was dismissed as an awkward customer encounter, Charlotte turned up to work as usual for the next two weeks. But while talking to a regular about her upcoming trip to Cornwall the shop door swung open only to mark the return of ‘PC Terry’. “I was joking about the amount of pasties and ice creams I’ll eat before a man with a bald head and stubble walked in”, she said. “My initial thought was ‘oh God not him again’.” “I didn’t want to get stuck in another half an hour conversation so I hid round the back and got my boss to serve him. “He seemed to be in and out pretty quick and didn’t bother hanging around. “I managed to dodge him.”  But Charlotte was unaware the creep had managed to swipe one of her business cards with all her contact details. Later that evening she received an email from a potential customer asking for a painting for one of his kids - sealing it off with eight kisses. She said: “I thought it was weird but needed to put money towards my dog’s vet bills. “At the time I just thought ‘a commission is a commission’. “I messaged asking what animal he was after and within seconds I got a reply asking if he could call me. “I had just finished a five hour shift and was exhausted so I just made the excuse that my phone couldn’t take calls. “But that wasn’t working. He just continued to ask if he could phone me.  “At this point I just thought Terry was a pushy customer.” Over the next seven days Charlotte was receiving between 20-50 text messages a day. Charlotte told her mum who encouraged her to phone the police. “As soon as I mentioned his name the police officer said ‘Ah, he’s known to us.’ “The police told me to send one reply telling him not to contact me again. “They then told me if I received a response to come back and they’ll take action.” Despite assurances from the police that she was in safe hands, Charlotte was still fearing her harasser was watching her every move.  Not willing to take any chances, she swapped shifts in a bid to avoid bumping into him. She was also chaperoned by her mum and her pet dog to and from her 20 minute walk to work. Two days after Charlotte received a message from a new number asking her out. Realising who it was, she went straight to the police where they arrested Waynark immediately. He was locked up at Portsmouth Crown Court having been found guilty of stalking involving serious alarm or distress. The defendant had previously been handed a 24 week sentence for harassing an ex-girlfriend after she broke up with him for impersonating a police officer.

Kay Longstaff, 46, plunged off the 92,000-ton Norwegian Star 60 miles off the Croatian coast as it headed toward Venice on Saturday. She had spent the evening drinking on the vessel which was sailing to Venice from the port of Vargarola in Croatia and fell from the enormous ship, into the Adriatic Sea. The 46-year-old told Croatian media that she had fallen off the back of the ship. CCTV is now being studied to discover how she came to be in the water.  After 10 hours in the ocean she was rescued by a coastguard cutter and Pilatus PC-9 spotter plane. She was found at around 9.30am Sunday morning local time (8.30am UK time) around 1,300 metres from where she vanished and was lifted to safety. Not everyone who falls in the sea would be so lucky with several key factors attributed to her survival.  A rescuer said Kay\u0027s yoga fitness and singing helped her survive.  A rescuer said: “She (Kay) said the fact she practices yoga helped her as she was fit. “And she said she was singing to not feel cold in the sea overnight.” The sea is also relatively warm at this time of year. With the hot temperatures the Adriatic Sea is warmer than it would have been at roughly 25C.  If it had been 5C she would not have survived an hour.  But that did not stop Kay developing some signs of hypothermia shortly before being reunited with her family. Being a woman also helped with females having about 10% more body fat than a man so it\u0027s easier to float and you spend less energy treading water. Kay was taken to hospital after her ordeal but was discharged a short time later. Croatian Ministry of Maritime Affairs spokesman David Radas said: “Our rescuers were in touch with the Norwegian Star’s crew and by checking CCTV knew the exact moment she fell in the water. “Because they knew the time, they were able to know the exact position of the ship.”  He added to the Daily  that Ms Longstaff was not injured, just exhausted, hypothermic and in shock. When they reached the coast, she felt pretty much recovered. That was also confirmed by the hospital staff after they conducted a preliminary health check.

Steve Pearce and Sam Coley, both in their mid 20s, are now making millions since founding their tech product TickX, based at Tower 12 in Spinningfields, in the Northern Quarters of Manchester, Manchester Evening News reports. Their business product, which started garnering traction once backed by the Ministry of Sound, is founded on one basic premise: that humans are social animals who love to be entertained. Founded in 2015, the platform brings together events from 75-plus ticket sellers, including Ticketmaster, Headout and Skiddle, allowing users to compare prices and get the best deal for their night out - through the website and app.  The idea came to Pearce while he studied economics at the University of Manchester and found himself desperately sifting through flyers or scrolling websites for the best prices. He said: “There was a lot of conflicting information from ticket vendors and promoters and that’s when I saw the opportunity. “You look at almost every market globally and there is a billion pound aggregator, so if you are booking a flight you would use Skyscanner, hotels maybe Trivago or car rentals would be Rentalcars. We couldn’t believe that there wasn’t already a local or global firm filling that gap in the market so that’s when we decided to join forces on TickX. I bought a sports car instead of going to university The 26-year-old knew he had the business development and sales expertise but was lacking in the product and tech experience - which is where Coley excels. Having grown up on the west coast of Scotland, 25-year-old Coley admits being obsessed with technology and business from a young age.  “It started off with selling toys to my friends and then chewing gum at school to learning about tech and teaching myself to code. “When I was a bit older I set up an online auction site from my bedroom to sell boats called Bid Marine.” Calling it an ‘unbelievable learning curve’ the youngster headed off to Harvard University for work experience before setting up a software development company aged 15. “I started building websites for local businesses and that grew into app development and big scale projects like cloud software.” However, when his youth became a barrier to getting larger projects, the enterprising youngster took an office in the local town and employed his father. Defying expectations he turned down a place at university to focus on the company and fondly remembers buying his first sports car as his friends settled into student life. Starting up TickX Interested by Pearce’s concept for a ticketing comparison site, the pair set out to build a one-stop destination to discover what events were happening, who was selling tickets and at what price. “While Sam was building the platform on evenings and weekends I was going out and bringing on board ticket partners,” says Pearce. Once the product was built and they started getting traction the founders knew it was time to ‘put their foot on the gas.’ “We believe that fortune favours the bold so we wanted to give it a good shot.” This turned out to be very true as they managed to get Ministry of Sound on board after a cold call.  “It was their first ever tech investment and it was a huge stamp of validation for us having one of the biggest independent record labels in the world back TickX,” he added. Coley chips in brightly: “It allowed us to jump that stage of credibility which a lot of small companies struggle with. People instantly took notice and the name had a massive impact.” Now the platform pulls in 125,000 events from more than 75 ticket partners and prioritises them in order of cheapest first. Last year they sold more than \u0026pound4m of tickets and are on track to grow that significantly. In fact, they have set their sights on building it into a billion pound business here in Manchester. Coley explains: “The opportunity there is massive. Globally it is about \u0026pound160bn a year on experience spend - in the UK it’s \u0026pound7bn all in. “It’s a huge market and if we nail it then it is a massive opportunity - that’s why we are excited and why the investors are excited.” Turning down the Dragons Another reason people have been taking notice is their appearance on BBC hit programme Dragons’ Den where the duo audaciously turned down \u0026pound75,000 investment from three dragons. Filmed in May 2016, Pearce recalls: “We never applied to go on to the show. The researchers actually reached out to us after the Manchester Evening News featured TickX in a top start-ups list.” His business partner says: “As we were already trying to raise investment we had the research to hand on what the problem was and how it needed fixing - so we got invited to audition and two weeks later we were pitching to the dragons.” Comparing it to an ‘intense boxing match’ Coley also praised it as ‘an unreal experience’ - although they didn’t expect to be in the pitch for an hour and a half.  “It was pretty surreal because we had both watched the show since we were young and then to find ourselves in the den was crazy.” This intensified as Nick Jenkins, the founder of online greeting card retailer Moonpig, Touker Suleyman and entrepreneur Peter Jones made them offers. However, the pair felt what they were asking for in equity undervalued the business. “We made the brave, or stupid, decision to decline them,” smiles Pearce. “Actually, we realised there are other people out there who can add value to the business and once they were excited about TickX we could find the capital externally.” This risk paid off, literally, as they ended up raising ten times more than what they had asked for in the den. The \u0026pound750,000 funding round was led by 24 Haymarket giving access to a syndicate of industry leaders and high net worth individuals. They also got some investment from Nick Ferguson, the former chairman of BskyB, and tech innovator Stan Boland, who is devising a self driving car. “We were a young team at the time and we just decided to surround ourselves with the best investors, backers and advisors,” remembers Pearce. His business partner agrees emphatically. “We really want to build an A-class team so the first part of that was getting good investors on board including Tim Chambers, the former Ticketmaster executive, who probably had the best industry knowledge you could ask for.” And this desire to pull in the right mix of investors and business leaders has paid off for the team. “The advice for any young entrepreneur starting in businesses is just to really get out there and get meeting people,” explains Pearce. “Also an investor isn’t always what you think an investor is - one of ours is someone I previously worked with. I think it\u0027s important to remember that people invest in an idea and the team which will deliver it.” A second round of funding led by venture capitalists BGF Ventures raised \u0026pound3m and will help accelerate their push into Europe. So where is TickX today? The growth has been pretty significant from a few hundred users when they first launched in the UK to more than one million last year. And the only way is up after expanding into new territories, including Ireland and the Netherlands. Not to mention running the ticketing site for NME. So how does it work? TickX is not a ticket selling platform - instead it helps people discover what is happening and to go out more to live events. I find the co-founders are genuinely passionate about this - and albout making sure people don’t get ripped off. The model works as TickX receives a commission from the ticket partner’s booking fee, making them an additional marketing channel to help reach a wider audience and drive up ticket sales. TickX\u0027s audience is a very big mix, the paper reports. “We started off focusing on the student market,” says the Manchester graduate. “Then it was young professionals with gigs before we started to see the huge potential in theatre with high order values and commission.” Coley agrees: “Our vision has changed a lot over the last three years. “We started off by focusing on events and now we really see the whole ‘experience market’. “People are looking to spend less money on things and more on going out and experiencing the world. That’s why the market is exploding. “It’s not just about the Instagram story, people don’t want disposable things any more - they want these experiences.” TickX are looking to innovate around this, launching a cinema offering this month and also building on their tech capabilities.

Passengers scrambled to find out flight information as staff were forced to write down departure details on whiteboards following the technical glitch just after 8am. Travellers crowded around frantically checking which gate they needed to head for as IT experts tried to get the boards back up and running. Gatwick officials said the issues were due to an ongoing problem with Vodafone, which provides IT for the airport. Vodafone said it was down to a damaged fibre cable, which engineers were working hard to fix.   Passengers also claimed the mobile app was not working, as many took to Twitter to ask the airport\u0027s customer services team for their gate information.  Footage posted on Twitter shows scores of exasperated passengers crowding around one tiny whiteboard while an airport worker on a radio wrote down the latest details. Photos also showed employees standing in front of another boards in the departure lounge looking clearly stressed out as they looked at information they had written down. On passenger sympathising with staff wrote on Twitter: Can you imagine how many languages are there trying to ask questions? I wish them luck and Calmness for all.    And one traveller posted: Serious whiteboard based business continuity going on in Gatwick. All flight information screens down. Poor chap with a 2-way radio trying to keep it up to date with hundreds looking on. Canadian passenger, mezzo-soprano Elizabeth Humphries, tweeted: Appalling Gatwick Airport, with broken monitors and a tiny whiteboard for announcing gates. Thank goodness I have eagle vision and can read messy writing from a distance. Why not pre-assign gates like Canadian airports? #Laughable #TypicalBritain. And Tamara Salem tweeted: Gatwick Airport: The systems are down - get the whiteboard out! Generation Z: What are whiteboards? #OldSchool #BackInSchool.

A clip taken inside HMP Birmingham this year shows one lag puffing on what appears to be a cannabis joint while others play pool. Another seemingly shows a prisoner slumped down after seemingly taking the drug Spice behind bars. The government has finally had enough of poor standards at the G4S-run jail, and has been forced to step in and take control. Inspectors found the prison in “an appalling state” with high violence, widespread bullying, squalid living conditions and poor control by fearful staff. In the video which emerged earlier this year, prisoners livestreamed themselves jokingly calling themselves the slider gang - due to their matching blue and white striped flip-flops. One man claims to have a bag of weed and a phone charger.  The video – entitled \u0027English jail inside with iPhones smoking Cali\u0027 – was uploaded by a user called Ray in April. It shows six prisoners lying on a bed in a cell while listening to music while another lag is seen smoking what appears to be a cannabis joint. One inmate repeatedly says Cali which is slang for cannabis, before warning that the screw is active, in reference to the prison guard. The video also shows a group of prisoners standing in the rubbish-strewn communal area outside the cells sharing around a rolled up cigarette while others play pool.  The prisoner shooting the video then comments jail life before turning the camera round and telling the viewer, we can get big thing, small thing. And another video, passed to Birmingham Live inFebruary, appears to show a motionless prisoner lying face down on their bed. It is believed he had taken Spice. Yet another shocking clip from November last year shows prisoners eating cockroaches in a twisted I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! inspired game.  Disturbing footage shows one inmate declare “I’m A Celebrity, get me out of HMP Birmingham!” as he is dared to scoff the insects in a mock bushtucker trial . The creatures appear to have been plucked from the floor and placed on a plastic tray - just like the ITV reality show. The MoJ decision to take over the prison comes as the chief prisons inspector has invoked a special measure calling on the Justice Secretary David Gauke to launch an urgent and independent enquiry into the crisis. In a letter sent to David Gauke on 16 August, Peter Clarke demanded an explanation for how the prison had “been allowed to deteriorate so dramatically” since its last inspection 18 months ago.  Inspectors found that out of the 70 recommendations made at the previous inspection - just 14 had been achieved while none of the main recommendations concerning violence, staff-prisoner relationships, poor regimes and a lack of focus on education, training and work had been met. The damning letter reveals a catalogue of failures and paints a picture of a total loss of control on the part of the G4S management. HMP Birmingham has the largest volume of assaults (1,434) of all prisons in the year to July 2018. Experts found that the assaults were often serious and that prisoners and staff frequently needed hospital treatment.

People have been quick to point out that jerk seasoning doesn\u0027t typically go on rice - but chicken, fish and other meats. The TV chef has been accused of cultural appropriation by people on social media, including Labour MP Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities minister. She wrote on Twitter that the celeb\u0027s jerk rice is not OK and that his appropriation from Jamaica needs to stop, adding that jerk is not just a word you put before stuff to sell products.      She also wrote that Jamie Oliver should get a masterclass in jerk by Levi Roots, the creator of Reggae Reggae sauce. Jerk is a type of cooking that originates in Jamaica, where meat is dry-rubbed or marinated in a seasoning made up of all spice, scotch bonnets and other ingredients. People accused him of cultural appropriation because the ingredients aren\u0027t traditional. One Twitter user wrote: I was about to headbutt my desk over this tweet from Dawn Butler because most cultural appropriation brouhahas are nonsense.  Then I saw this description of Jamie Oliver\u0027s Jerk Rice. On what planet can garlic, ginger and jalapenos be described as Jerk?\u0027 Some people have been quick to jump to Jamie Oliver\u0027s defence: arguing that the UK is a multicultural country and cooking different cuisines isn\u0027t the same as cultural appropriation. One person tweeted: Now while I do think Jamie needs taking down a peg or three you\u0027re all getting very silly over this appropriation stuff. If no one cooked/ate food from other cultures in the world what a boring life we\u0027d lead.

More than half of UK airports charge for drop-off parking with some charging up to \u0026pound25 for just a 30 minute stay but there are ways to help you save money .  For example, drop-off or short stay charges at Liverpool John Lennon Airport start from \u0026pound3 for five minutes and can go up to \u0026pound10 for a half-an-hour stay on the day, while pre-bookable parking can start from \u0026pound6.50 for one hour.  It\u0027s even higher at Stansted. And, last month, Manchester Airport announced that people would be charged if they wanted to drop off passengers directly outside the terminals, reports the Liverpool Echo .    But the Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis has revealed how best to avoid the charges.  Before your trip, do your research before arriving at the airport. Many give you a \u0027cheap\u0027 first five or 10 minutes at the terminal drop-off area. However once that time is up prices quickly go into the tens of pounds.

The businessman woke up at around at 7am on Saturday morning and posted the keys through his hotel letter box only to find himself carless. Armed with all his belongings Mr Rivers was was confronted with a gaping hole in the road where his Mercedes Benz once was and a phone number pinned to a lamp post.  It wasn\u0027t until his wife, Asha, finally got in touch with a vehicle recovery company that Mr Rivers was re-united with his car, Daily Records reports.   The 52-year-old said: “I spent hours walking the streets but there’s no way I would have found the car without Asha phoning round the vehicle recovery companies.

Natalie Forester and Chloe Hattersley were feeding their children during baby swim sessions at Dimensions pool in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. They were then stopped by staff who asked them to leave the pool while breastfeeding and sit on the side. Stoke-on-Trent City Council, which runs Dimensions, says breastfeeding is welcome at the poolside, but is ‘discouraged’ in its swimming pools ‘for the health and comfort of the child and to avoid the risk of the child regurgitating or vomiting in the pool’.  But Natalie and Chloe say this policy does not make sense and is at odds with the Equality Act 2010, reports Stoke-on-Trent Live .   Mother-of-three Natalie, of Sneyd Green, was at an Aquatots session with her 18-month-old son Josiah when she was stopped from feeding. The 30-year-old said: “There were about five other parents in the pool with their children. The rest of the pool was closed to the public. “Josiah was distressed so I thought I would give him some milk. I thought if we got out he would get cold, so I moved away and turned my back to the group. I was only going to feed him for a couple of minutes to comfort him. “The teacher came over and said I couldn’t do it in the pool and I would have to sit on the side. I was made to feel like I was doing something wrong. “I didn’t want a confrontation so I moved, which I’m annoyed about now. I felt degraded.” Natalie asked for a copy of Dimensions’ breast-feeding policy, and found the rule under the Food and Beverage section.  She said: “Stoke-on-Trent has one of the lowest breast-feeding rates in the country and they should be encouraging people, not doing this.” First-time mum Chloe, of Middleport, had a similar experience while at an Aquatots session with her 17-month-old son Milo. The 19-year-old said: “I have breastfed in the water before, but on this occasion a lifeguard shouted across the pool to me to stop doing it. “Everyone was staring. Normally I would stand my ground, but I was really embarrassed so I just got out. “I’ve made an offical complaint. I don’t see how the council’s policy can override the law – it’s discrimination.” The Equality Act 2010 says it is discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.

Johnny McMenamin, 36, and his five year-old daughter were delayed at Reus airport in Spain for two hours last Monday, before spending nearly three hours on board the plane while it sat on the runway. They had been due to take off at 9.45pm for East Midlands Airport where they planned to go to a theme park the following day before making their way back home to Co Tyrone, in Northern Ireland.  Johnny said he was horrified that airline staff insisted he pay for a bottle of water and Pringles for his child when they finally took off, reports Belfast Live .  The father said he was even accused of stealing from the bar in an announcement from the pilot.  He said: After eventually boarding two hours late we didn\u0027t go anywhere for another two hours 45 minutes. Staff were rude and people were having to ask for water. By the time we took off my daughter was distressed and tired. Johnny said the dispute arose when he realised, after chatting to another passenger, that he had missed an offer of vouchers for refreshments that were distributed in the departure lounge. He claimed flight attendants on board refused to give him the same vouchers afforded to other passengers. He said: I couldn\u0027t believe they were trying to charge me for a snack for a child when we had been delayed for 4 hours 39 minutes.

Savvy Clair Hughes, 30, started researching ways to save money as a way of getting out of her \u0026pound3,500 overdraft. During her search, Clair, from Bury, Greater Manchester, stumbled upon a \u0027couponing\u0027 community online - and was hooked. Clair now estimates she’s saved “easily over \u0026pound15,000” - and even managed to put down a deposit to buy a three-bed semi-detached house with her partner, Shane Byrne, also 30. Revealing how she never pays full price for an item anymore, thrifty Clair, who works in a local school, said: “It’s become a running joke with my friends. Every time we go out, they’ll ask if I have a voucher – and I always do. “Discounts are always there to be had, it’s just a matter of being organised.  “Before I started this, I thought it’d be so much work, but now I’m so used to this lifestyle that it’s automatic to me. I must have saved easily over \u0026pound15,000.” Clair’s mind first turned to money saving back in 2010, when she moved in with Shane, a phone company trainer. Having recently graduated from Edge Hill University, near Wigan, where she studied drama and physical theatre, she’d maxed out her \u0026pound3,500 student overdraft – and felt the interest repayments were just “money down the drain.” After taking to the web for advice, she tried out a few clever money saving tricks like switching her overdraft to a zero-interest account. Then, a few years later, she came across an online community for “couponers” and decided to give it a go.  She started spending hours trawling the web for money off vouchers or discount codes, printing them all out to take with her whenever she went shopping. “It would initially take a couple of hours to get organised,” she said. “I’d go on supermarket websites to look through what I’d need in a shop, making a note of anything on offer, or anything I had a coupon for. “Eventually though it becomes second nature and you can do it in around half an hour.” Over the years, the coupon queen has managed to nab some impressive hauls. Two lamps worth \u0026pound140 cost her just \u0026pound35, and because she learnt buying in bulk is usually cheaper, she scored six months worth of dog food for her Pomeranian Poppy for a mere \u0026pound9. Around two years ago, Clair also began using cashback apps and websites where you are given money back on items ranging from beers to toiletries.  After each shop, she uploads pictures of her receipts, which are then scanned, and money is given back on certain items. “I’ve saved hundreds through that alone,” said bargain-mad Clair. “You can get cashback on most things, and it’s all something I’d have been buying anyway. If something is totally free, I always make sure I get it regardless of whether I’ll use it, as I can donate it to a charity or foodbank. “But with cashback, I make sure it’s worth my while.” Among her other top saving tips, Clair recommends taking part in paid online surveys, which have earned her hundreds in high street vouchers, hitting the shops at certain times of the day to take advantage of reduced ‘yellow sticker’ stock, signing up to receive trials or tester products or trawling cosmetics counters for freebies. She added: “I have managed to get a lot of freebies by messaging or writing to companies to compliment them on their products. People always assume you get freebies for complaining – but it pays more to be nice.  “I’ve heard a lot about a practice called wombling too, which is basically collecting other people’s discarded receipts from shopping trolleys to check for missed discounts.  I’d love to give it a try but there doesn’t seem to be a receipt to be found at my local supermarket.” Having set herself the goal of owning a home by the time she was 30, Clair - who has set up an Instagram dedicated to sharing her thrifty pearls of wisdom - was delighted to exchange just five days shy of her landmark birthday. And now, after Shane proposed to her on his birthday earlier in August, she is looking ahead to planning the ultimate shoestring wedding.

After a scorching summer, with temperatures well above average in most parts, forecasters are predicting a much chillier end to August. The mercury is expected to drop well below average which most areas in with a chance of seeing some rain. Latest computer models suggest frequent showers and longer spells of rain in the north and west, while drier, brighter periods are expected further south. However, there is even a risk of some light rain falling across southern regions, with it feeling quite humid as temperatures recover into the low to mid-20s C.  Before then, It is likely to be fresh across the whole of the UK with cooler conditions bowling in from the north-west. It should remain unsettled for most during the early part of the Bank Holiday weekend, with best of the conditions in the south of England and Wales due to high pressure located to the southwest of the UK. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “High pressure builds in from the North Atlantic through this week, it will bring a north-westerly flow of cooler air. After several weeks of persistent above-normal temperatures, the mercury is expected to dip well below average in some areas.  “From Thursday, things are expected to turn cooler with the chilliest day of the weekend on Saturday. As the high continues to extend eastwards, it bring a more westerly flow over the British Isles. “Temperatures will start to recover by Sunday.” Leading bookmaker Coral makes it odds on, at 4-5, that rain falls over the Bank Holiday weekend in London despite some warm temperatures forecast. Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead said: “The temperatures are set to be quite mild for the final Bank Holiday of the summer but in true English style we think there’s a big chance of some showers spoiling the day.

After a brief respite and some very welcome rain, the country will return to more humid, muggy weather in the run-up to the last Bank Holiday weekend of the year. Monday will begin with sunny spells in Scotland and northern England. Central areas will see spots of rain with cloud building in the north and rain spells expected after 12pm. But the Met said they won’t be “long-lived or heavy”, and that light winds will bring temperatures in the north to 22C and 26C in the south.   Yet the cooler weather isn’t bound to last long as the Met Office said it will be “quite humid and muggy through Tuesday and Wednesday”.  Highs of 26C are expected in the north, while the south may reach 27C or 28C depending on the sunshine. Londoners are also set for another 25C heatwave on Wednesday, but the Met said it’ll feel fresher because of rain, before it cools down to 20C on Friday.  It comes after the UK was battered by Storm Ernesto over the weekend, with the north being the worst hit and the Met forecasting up two-and-a-half inches of rain.     Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “Ernesto’s warm and humid air stays here for the first half of the week, with 26-28C from Monday to Wednesday in the South, with mainly dry weather for most. “A cold front brings rain on Thursday, but the Bank Holiday weekend looks relatively warm at 23C and a degree or two warmer not ruled out. “The South will be mainly dry, and the North still seeing good sunny spells, but less settled.” UV levels will be high or moderate across the country, while pollen levels will remain low. Summer 2018 has a chance of ending up the warmest on record for the UK, with the race for the top spot wide open, according to the Met Office.

Met Office figures show these warm months are on track to be the hottest since UK-wide records began in 1910.  Temperatures from June 1 to August 15 averaged 16.1C, hotter than 2006’s record 15.78C from June 1 to August 31. This summer’s average maximum temperature of 21.1C so far is also hotter than 1976’s record 21C. The soaring temperatures have seen packed beaches and parks - and also a surge in the number of sunburn cases reported to the NHS.

This summer will beat 1976’s record 17.77C in central England if August’s average temperature rises just 0.3C from 17.9C to 18.2C by the end of the month.    This summer is set to eclipse 2003’s scorcher as well as older hot summers including drought-ravaged 1826 and 1781, and 1666, when the Great Fire of London ripped through the tinder-dry city. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “It\u0027s been a damn good summer and the best I can remember. It’s one we’ll remember for many years. All parts of the UK have seen good weather. “Warm weather in coming days favours this summer challenging to become the hottest UK-wide summer on record.” It\u0027s no secret that hot weather can wreak havoc with your skin.  From oily sun lotion to air conditioning units - there’s no shortage of ways the summer can take a toll on your complexion.  But what does the hot weather really do to your skin, and how can you protect it? Candice Brown, specialist skin aesthetician at London Bridge Plastic Surgery and Aesthetic Clinic, gives her top tips on how to survive the summer with glowing skin.  Sun damage Candice says: “Damage from the sun is obviously the biggest threat to your skin during the summer months. “In hot weather even though most people will wear an SPF, if we sit in the sun all day it doesn’t matter how much sun lotion you apply to your skin - you are never going to stop the damage from occurring. “Alongside a good SPF I always recommend clients should be using a product that can repair the skin’s barrier. A good serum in addition to a product that can keep the skin hydrated is a must. “It’s also important to find a shaded area during the hottest hours of the day. I know some people are desperate for a tan, but you can still get a healthy glow by wearing an SPF and placing yourself in areas shielded from direct sunlight. “The short term effect that sun damage can cause to your skin just isn’t worth it irritation, redness and sensitivity. Sun damage and dehydration can also result in longer term effects such as the formation of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as pigmentation concerns.” Sudden temperate changes Candice says: “During the hot weather it’s not uncommon to go from direct sunlight to a really cool, air conditioned office.  “But going from hot to cold too quickly can cause redness and thread veins on the skin. I would say from midday to 3pm to try and avoid being in direct sunlight. This should reduce the threat of such extreme changes in temperature.” Sea and sand The beach can be a welcome break during a heatwave, but it’s not without its risks.  Candice says: “The sea and sand can be really irritating to the skin. On top of this, the salt in sea water is drying and can cause the skin to become quite sensitive.  “When the skin loses hydration it can lose brightness, leaving your skin looking very dull!”.  “I would recommend using products with Hydroxy Acid such as serums and toners to keep the skin hydrated at all times. If you’re going on holiday, take a repair masque to help with any damage that has been caused to the skin barrier from the sun that day.  “These products can easily be placed into your beach bag to keep your skin hydrated throughout the day. And make sure you’re drinking two to three litres of water every day.  Makeup Think you’re protecting your skin because your favourite foundation contains an SPF? Think again.  Candice says: “Don’t rely on make-up for the best source of SPF. “Unless you’re re-applying a really thick layer of makeup you’re not going to be getting a full SPF coverage. Make-up isn’t always applied evenly and it can come off easily throughout the day.  “You should be applying a separate SPF in the morning and then if you want to apply a tint afterwards then you can. This way you know every inch of your face is going to be covered and protected.” Pool water  Candice says: “The chlorine found in swimming pool water can make your eyes feel sensitive, and it can do the same to your skin.  “Chlorine tends to strip the skin of natural oils leaving your skin dry, itchy, flaky, and sensitive. So it’s really important to reach for a lotion or serum with alpha hydroxy acid to hydrate and help restore the pH balance of your skin”. Air conditioning It might be a blessing during a heatwave, but air conditioning units aren’t all good news.  Candice says: “Air conditioning in both the summer and the winter can cause problems, and can definitely affect your skin.  “It can dry it out making the skin feel tight and very dehydrated. So you probably feel as if you need to be using a lot more products to keep it looking and feeling healthy.  “Anti-oxidants through the summer and winter months are a must. Vitamin C is not only necessary for collagen production and maintenance, but also a potent antioxidant that can neutralise free radicals in the skin. “A good vitamin C serum and an SPF 30/50 are two products I would advise to apply to the skin before leaving the house” The Met Office’s Dr Mark McCarthy said: “It’s clear summer 2018 is exceptional for the consistent levels of warmth throughout the period.” Unfortunately the weather will not stay good for the upcoming Bank Holiday. Forecasters are predicting a much chillier end to August.

Accountancy giant PwC charging up to \u0026pound1,156 an hour feels as excessive as the Unite union claims, especially when concerns about the company’s previous work were raised by MPs Frank Field and Rachel Reeves, joint heads of a Parliamentary inquiry that accused the auditor of a conflict of interest. Field’s dig that PwC had “every incentive to milk the Carillion cow dry” is reinforced by the eyewatering invoices. The insistence by a financial behemoth that the cost would otherwise be higher will only infuriate victims of a terrible corporate failure. Carillion was an ugly face of capitalism, run for the benefit of a few at the price of the many. PwC is not covering itself in glory.  Theresa May has not just abandoned a Tory promise to get rid of mixed sex hospital wards but gone in total reverse. Close on 15,000 patients had to share wards with the opposite sex last year, a betrayal of 2010 and 2015 Tory manifesto promises. Uncaring May does not seem to care about stripping NHS patients of their privacy. What might be acceptable occasionally in exceptional emergencies is not OK when it happens because of poor management or because austerity cuts have forced hospitals to shed beds. Until the Tories sort simpler problems such as the banning of mixed wards they have no chance of finding a cure for the bigger issues.

In truth I\u0027d never fancied it myself, but in 2018, Tinder and other apps, like Bumble, seem to be the way to meet people. Personally I prefer talking to faces instead of typing on a screen - and there\u0027s something that\u0027s quite scary about the idea of meeting someone that you\u0027ve never met in person. But I downloaded it in an attempt to see what the modern world of dating is really like, and recounted the experience on Wales Online.  As little as two weeks ago, I thought Tinder was rife with people sending unwanted explicit images, flirting and basically finding people to have sex with. But apparently it\u0027s not (just) about that. Still, all over the internet, there are horror stories about people\u0027s experiences. One woman described being sent a picture of a penis with a measuring tape next to it by a guy she met, another described being given chlamydia by a guy who she later found out was already in relationships with two other women. In Wales, a would-be consultant harassed a woman he met on Tinder, sending her emails and hacking her Facebook account . While cases like this may be rare (at least, I hope they are), there\u0027s still good reason to be wary and it was hard to go into this with confidence. But at least you can\u0027t send pictures on the app. I found this out from a fellow user about an hour after downloading it - for that to happen I would have to add them on another form of social media such as Snapchat or Instagram . Sweet joy! I did not have to put myself through seeing genitals of various shapes and sizes for the purpose of this experiment. Saying that, the fear soon upped when I accidentally super-liked about three people in the space of the first hour. Not ideal.  From the get-go I knew I was never going to meet up with anyone - but as soon as I started swiping I could see what to avoid: 1. People without profile pictures. Why would you not show your face? 2. People with odd profile pictures. I saw everything from a set of sex toys to a quote that read \u0027I want to do bad things to you\u0027 to a chicken nugget. An actual chicken nugget. None of which encouraged me to swipe right. 3. People who had their hands down their pants in pictures. 4. People who are open about wanting hook-ups in their bios. If you like a six pack - you\u0027ll see a lot of them on Tinder. There are a lot of guys who post topless pictures of themselves or snaps of them working out at the gym. A lot also posted selfies with their dogs (I know what you\u0027re trying to do!) and kids, before quickly pointing out they were their nephews or nieces (Hey, I love kids but I don\u0027t have any of my own). During my short stint, I had one or two requests to add guys on Instagram but I gracefully declined. What I found more intriguing is that a lot of people don\u0027t actually talk on Tinder.

Chris Watts, 33, will appear in court today charged with murdering daughters Bella, four, and Celeste, three and wife Shanann, who was 15-weeks pregnant with a baby boy that they were going to name Nico.  Following his arrest on Wednesday his lawyer requested for DNA swabs to be taken from his dead daughters\u0027 necks. On Friday it was revealed the request had been refused, with a judge saying he \u0027won\u0027t tell experts how to do their job.\u0027  Last week Watts sobbed on TV as he appealed for the return of the trio before allegedly confessing he had killed them - but the cause of their death has not been made officially public.   The bodies were found on the property of Anadarko Petroleum, one of Colorado\u0027s largest oil and gas drillers where Watts worked. Court documents filed by defence lawyer James Merson said the girls had been submerged in crude oil for four days. His lawyers said the DNA would be tested by forensics expert Richard Eikelenboom, who worked on the JonBenet Ramsey trial. But his lawyer Megan Ring said in a two-page filing to a court in Weld County, Colorado, that a \u0027coroner, pathologist, or anyone working on behalf of the prosecution team in autopsy\u0027 don\u0027t plan to take swabs of the necks of the two girls.  Ring had asked that DNA expert Eikelenboom be allowed to do the testing, saying that they believed that DNA would remain on the necks of the girls \u0027in spite of the fact that the remains were in oil for four days\u0027 - revealing for the first time that the bodies were hidden on Monday. Autopsies on the bodies were conducted Friday, although an official cause of death has not been announced - although it is believed the request from Watts\u0027 defence team suggests they could have been strangled. A body language expert who closely studied the recordings of the interviews said last week that they thought it was apparent that the \u0027killer\u0027 dad was lying.  Lillian Glass told HollywoodLife that Watts\u0027 spoke too much and was giving out too much information.   He said at the time: I have no inclination where they\u0027re at right now. I\u0027ve exhausted every friend that I know of and every friend that I have has called friends that Shanann has that maybe I didn\u0027t know about. ... Just vanished.

The American couple, both 29, wrote about their moments of \u0027human connection\u0027 with strangers along the way, on a shared blog and in Instagram posts.  Jay insisted he believed humans were kind, wonderful and generous - despite what \u0027you read in the papers about the world being a scary place\u0027.

And two days later, IS reportedly released a video vowing \u0027to kill disbelievers\u0027. As they travelled, Jay had written on their blog: Evil is a make-believe concept we’ve invented to deal with the complexities of fellow humans holding values and beliefs and perspectives different than our own … By and large, humans are kind.

Laura Denmar, 26, was taken to hospital and needed stitches following the brutal attack, which also saw her boyfriend pinned to a wall. She had to have emergency hospital treatment after the attack in the Croatian resort of Split - and has now warned others about shady accommodation operators. The couple have cut short their month-long trip. Laura said: “We are doing okay now that we are back in the UK, but it was a really terrifying ordeal. “It was clear that the entire operation was not legal in the first place - and the attack was definitely premeditated.

Laura, a student at London’s Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, travelled to Croatia last month with boyfriend Jeremy, 39. She and the Canadian videographer booked a \u0026pound60-a-night hostel through a major website because of peak season hotel prices. But when they arrived in the city’s picturesque Old Town, on the Dalmatian coast, they were immediately sent away to a grimy suburb.  She said: We were told that we had to pick up the keys from a different hostel, and then make our way to the apartment. When we arrived we realised that it was not legitimate at all – there were 30 beds and only one bathroom and no one there running anything. We had nowhere else to stay and we had already paid so we decided to make do. On the last day, a cleaner came in early and told us that we needed to leave right away or pay more money. I told her that was unreasonable and refused to hand over any money and so she told us she would call the police if we did not leave. I knew what they were doing was illegal so I told her to go on and call the police. Instead she called a man who we think was the owner.

When they lifted her out to comfort her, they also discovered a hidden note, which read: The baby girl was born on 4th August 2018. The residents alerted police and took care of the newborn until officers arrived and took her to a hospital for treatment.  Medics say she is healthy and showed no apparent signs of illness or any birth defects. Good Samaritans have now been turning up to the hospital in South China hoping to adopt her. Local police, from Changmei in Huanjiang Maonan, confirmed the infant will remain with the authorities while they search for her mother or parents. If they are traced, they could face up to three years in jail if found guilty of abandonment.

The club had just been relegated and were in severe financial difficulties and Swan — Leith born and bred — stepped in.“He was a local baker and, after a couple of years of ‘toing-and-froing’ with the board, he was eventually elected chairman and would serve on the board for around 30 years.

I complicate my game sometimes but I’m working on just playing it simple and that’s what the gaffer and (assistant manager) Laurie Ellis want me to do.“They stress to me I have to play it simple at times and then do the magic when I can.”Not that it’s an easy process and Glass admits when he’s on the pitch he wants to be involved at the sharp end, doing the things that help win games.“I like to create chances and I really love to get shots in on the goal, it’s what my game is about.“I’m an attacking player and I like to excite but you can’t always do that and sometimes it is about keeping things simple and doing it for the team.”As those words show, this is a young man who does not lack confidence in his own ability but he’s also one who gives an honest assessment of his performances.For instance, while he was delighted to have played his part in a young United line-up that battled back from two goals down to beat St Johnstone’s U/21s in the Betfred Cup on Wednesday night, he was far from completely satisfied with his work.“It was a brilliant result, all the boys worked really hard to come from two behind like we did.“Obviously, the experienced players helped us a lot but I thought the young boys, including myself, dug in and we battled and battled.“St Johnstone were no mugs and I thought they really impressed so it was good to get on top of them by the end.“I know I wasn’t at my best but, like all the boys, I dug in and helped get the result.“I was maybe trying too hard at times for the killer pass or maybe trying to shoot too early.“Sometimes things don’t come off on the park but I still worked hard and helped the team and that’s what you have to make sure you do.”As he keeps grafting towards making the breakthrough in the first team on a regular basis, Glass was delighted by the victory, not least because it means there will be further opportunities to show he is ready.“This cup is a chance to get 90 minutes and, if I’m not playing in the league, I need to get games somewhere.“If it’s in the Irn-Bru Cup it’s better for me and the other boys, because they are very competitive, like league games.“You want to win them, both teams do, and it gives you the chance to show up well.“We want to do well in it and I think we can.“I thought our fitness was a big factor against St Johnstone.“We had a hard pre-season and I think we got the benefits of that against St Johnstone because we finished the game strongly and looked the fitter team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b76e6a876773.jpg ","title":"dundee woman louise can wed in style after winning tele competition","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA bride-to-be will walk down the aisle in style thanks to the Evening .Louise McDonald, 22, from Charleston, was named the winner of our Wed in Style competition during the Scottish Wedding Directory’s fashion show, held at DCT Media’s Meadowside HQ.Tele readers were invited to collect points in an innovatve fruit machine- style competition which used digital technology to create tens of thousands of unique gamecards.Louise topped the list of five finalists to win a Justin Alexander gown worth up to £1,500, sponsored by Alison Kirk Bridal, kilts for fiance Graeme Boyd and five groomsmen courtesy of Kilthire Company and her carriage for the big day in the shape of a classic vintage car, sponsored by the Lovely Wedding Car Company.She said she was “in total shock” after discovering she had won the big prize.“I’m over the moon.

He says, though, coming off was just a precaution after needing surgery on the same ankle last season.He said: “It was nothing too serious. I had a shot and rolled my ankle a bit and I’ve had previous with it, so it was a bit of a worry at the time. However, a good bit of rest and the physio saw it. I’ve trained this week and it’s good. I just need to keep an eye on it.”Now would be an unfortunate time for Spence to be ruled out of action after some impressive displays in the early-season games and particularly due to the level of competition in the position now at Dens Park.“Last year there were a lot of centre-mids but again this year we’re very strong there, one of the strongest areas in the team,” he added.“I think that’s good because it keeps everyone on their toes, you can’t slack because there will be somebody else to take your place.“I believe in my ability and I’ve worked hard over the summer, worked hard in pre-season, too.“Obviously, I’ve been in the position but Glen Kamara is to come back and you’ve got Adil Nabi, Paul McGowan, Elton Ngwatala and Kharl Madianga, so there’s a lot of competition in there. I think throughout the season it will be getting rotated round and, hopefully, I can be in that team.“I think I’ve done OK so far. It’s still early but I want to keep this up through the whole season.“Last year I played well in stages and then got injured so I want to play consistently every week, play as much as I can, and obviously help the team climb the table.”And the way to do that will be to start finding the net, something Spence is adamant that’ll change soon.“I think our luck will turn around.“We have to put some of these chances away, we all know that, but the main thing is we are creating chances.“One day it is going to click, something is just missing at the moment but we all believe in the guys up front to go and do it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/Weather-girls-stars-in-their-eyes.jpg.jpg ","title":"tonight matthew starz in thir ehs set to play in caird hall for final time","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDozens of headline acts – including “Tina Turner” and “Bruce Springsteen” – could be set to play at the Caird Hall for the final time next month.For the past eight years, amateur performers – including a number of Dundee City Council employees – have been disappearing behind the curtain and re-emerging as their celebrity alter egos for Starz In Thir Ehs.As the name suggests, the show is a homage to the much-loved TV show Stars in Their Eyes.Presented by Matthew Kelly, the show entertained prime-time Saturday night TV audiences for nearly two decades until it was cancelled in 2006 – and Starz in Thir Ehs has continued that tradition.Ron Whyte, of Stage 1 Theatre Company, said this year’s cast members are making the final preparations for the show which takes place on Thursday September 6.He said: “We’ve been doing this show for the last seven or eight years.“It started off with employees from the social work department at Dundee City Council and the cast has grown from there.”Formed in 1994, the theatre company has helped to raise more than £50,000 for local charities through performances, including the Starz In Thir Ehs shows.But audiences numbers have dwindled in recent years and Ron said next year’s show might have to be held at a smaller venue.Ron, from Douglas, added: “The show used to attract 800-900 people.“The numbers have gone down recently so it may well be the last time we decide to run the event in the Caird Hall.“We’ve got Bruce Springsteen playing this year as well as Kenny Rogers and Belinda Carlisle.“The show always went down well and we had great audience participation.“Since we started more than 20 years ago we must have raised £50,000 for local charities.“If it is a case that this is the last time at the Caird Hall, I’m sure we’ll go out with a bang.”Tickets for the show are available from the Dundee Box Office.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"two motorists convicted of driving 52mph on the kingsway","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo men were convicted of speeding on the Kingsway.Brian Evans, 40, of Rosemount Road, was fined £100.Evans admitted that on February 15 this year, at the A90 Kingsway West at Charlotte Street, he drove at 52mph in the 40mph zone.Meanwhile, Kelly Green, 32, of Dales Road in Peterhead, was fined £120 at the Justice of the Peace court.Green admitted that on February 19 this year he drove at 52mph in the 40mph zone of Kingsway West at Charlotte Street.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck -

Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the under-performance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs.\"The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.\"Retail workers trade union Usdaw says it is seeking \"urgent clarification\" from Homebase owner Hilco over its long-term plans for the firm.National officer Dave Gill said: \"All too often staff are excluded from the CVA process as the future of their jobs is being decided.\"Clearly there is a huge task ahead.

I was surprised.“I also disagreed with what the council said. They made out there were a lot of insects in the kitchen where we make food, but it was two insects in a back room.“They would have come in during a food delivery and it was an isolated incident – one we sorted out right away.”Mr Duncan said he was delighted to have passed the latest inspection and was looking forward to getting things back on track.“It was a bit of a setback, but we’re pleased it’s behind us now.“Our food tastes great and we have a wide range of dishes for people to sample.“I have a great team of staff and we love our customers calling in.“I hope that more people will come in over the coming days and weeks to see what we have to offer.”Mr Duncan added: “I am proud to run the business and always welcome customer feedback.“We pride ourselves on offering delicious food

maintenance.Sport Aberdeen took the decision in June to close the Linx Ice Arena for four weeks over the summer holidays in order to fix a “long-standing” issue at the rink.Work began on July 23 at the Beach Esplanade venue widely used by both adults and children for a number of activities including ice hockey and figure skating.It was during routine maintenance by engineers in March that the sport body was told of a small leak in the refrigeration plant.Sport Aberdeen told the Evening Express that if it was left untreated it could have caused more damage to the ice arena.The work worth in the region of £27,000 will fix the issue ahead of the organisation’s busy peak ice skating season.The arena is also used as the venue for home games of the Aberdeen Lynx Ice Hockey Club.The club is preparing for the upcoming season with a game against the Solway Sharks in a pre-season challenge on Saturday.Aberdeen Lynx chairman Martin Hill welcomed the upgrades.He said: “Aberdeen Lynx are looking forward to seeing the changes the repairs to and maintenance of the plant have made to the ice, along with the decorative improvements in public areas and enhancement of the former shop space to a multi-use area, which the club intend to utilise on a regular basis.\u0026#8220We appreciate all the hard work and investment that has come from Sport Aberdeen.”The arena is also home to another two ice hockey clubs and has youngsters taking part in figure skating and synchronised skating.Director of operations and asset development Keith Gerrard had previously told the Evening Express the repairs would help the rink’s “longevity”.He said: “Sport Aberdeen is committed to encouraging and supporting people to participate in physical activity and these repairs are crucial to ensure the longevity of Aberdeen’s only ice arena.”The Friday Night Disco, which was popular among teenagers, will return on

released have shown what a former Aberdeen industrial textile site could look like in the future.Developers Inhabit have put forward artist impressions in its bid to regenerate Broadford Works in Aberdeen.The former production site, which was once home to the largest collection of A-listed buildings in the country, has laid vacant since 2004.Earlier this year, developers launched a bid to create more than 400 homes in the area, with accommodation for 430 students, shops and office spaces.New details submitted to the local authority include proposals to light up the industrial site’s famous chimneys, and a two-storey extension to the top of the largest building, the Red Mill.Images created by Inhabit also include how Hutcheon Street could look following the redevelopment, with buildings raised around the road’s chimney stack and a large housing development behind a red brick facade.The Grey Mill, which dates back to 1808 and is one of the oldest iron-framed mills in Scotland, and the fourth oldest known in the world, is still earmarked for partial demolition, due to it being unsafe and unfeasible to retain the building in its entirety.Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart said: “The people living in the area will be pleased to see development finally taking place at Broadford, as they have had to deal with years of vandalism, arson and disruption.“Many of the plans and graphics seem to show that much of the heritage will be retained, and that is good news.“However, it is extremely unfortunate that the Grey Mill cannot be fully retained, and in my opinion everything possible must be done to retain this historic building.”North-east MSP Lewis Macdonald added: “Broadford Works has been neglected for far too long, and the longer they lie unused the greater the risk that all their historical value will be lost as a result of dilapidation and wilful fire-raising.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"motorists caught speeding on route","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDozens of speeding motorists have been caught out by cameras on a key stretch of an Aberdeen road in recent months, new figures show.The Evening Express used Freedom of Information laws to ask officials about drivers’ law breaking on a stretch of the A90 between Bridge of Dee and Danestone where the speed limit is 40mph – and discovered the top speed a driver had been caught out at between April 1 and August 7 this year was 72mph.Cameras monitor large swathes of the A90 – including the city section between the Bridge of Dee at the roundabout at Garthdee Road, from South to North Anderson Drive to the junction with Whitestripes Avenue, Danestone.Between April and July, cameras caught 65 drivers breaking the speed limit in that area, compared with 10 in 2017-18, 68 in 2016-17 and 129 in 2015-16.In previous years, the top speed caught by the cameras has been lower.It was 62mph in 2015-16, 68mph in 2016-17 and 56mph in 2018-19.“Each of the highest speeds were detected in the 40mph road speed limit sections,” said the FoI response, sent by the Scottish Safety Camera Unit.The data can come from fixed cameras, average speed cameras, police car cameras and mobile cameras.Dave Adams, an advanced driving tutor, said: “In my experience, being on the road as much as I am, adherence to the speed limit is variable at best.”Dave described speeding cars as “intimidating” to his students.He said: “It can also be confusing, because sometimes they will follow the driver in front, and if the driver in front isn’t adhering to the speed limit, then you have to correct them as quickly as possible.”Councillor Ian Yuill, whose ward falls close to the A90, described the findings as “alarming”.He said: “The speed limit is there for a reason, the road is well used by pedestrians.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"plans for flyover at notorious a90 junction go on display","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn exhibition is to take place this week regarding options to

said: “I’m delighted that Surfers Against Sewage want to be associated with our Stonehaven Harbour Festival.“Over the years we have had a nautical theme, from pirates to Vikings, and last year Splasher the dolphin, the mascot for the open air awimming pool, opened the festival and was a great success.“During 2018 there has been much publicity in the UK and worldwide about the dangers of plastics being dumped in the sea and other debris which is harmful to marine life.“This year we have invited Splasher once again to open the festival so we all felt it appropriate to highlight the

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tech savvy feis an tairbeirt gives musicians a professional edge","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 08/08/18, 7:29 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA Fèis an Tairbeirt workshop in music production, funded by Argyll and Bute Council\u0026#8217s Supporting Communities Fund, has been voted a success.Students recorded and produced their own tracks, created soundscapes with pre-recorded sounds, composed soundtracks and provided voiceovers for pieces of film and media during the three-day event.The chance to develop these skills is not usually offered outside of higher education but thanks to the knowledge and experience of tutor Luke Schofield, Fèis an Tairbeirt was able to offer this unique opportunity to local young adults.Another course has been arranged for September 15 and 16 and is limited to six places.The course is free but anyone interested should email feisantairbeirt@gmail to book a place.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man.

If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"donalds drive to solway trophy inspired by gran","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/08/18, 11:43 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSome of Argyll\u0026#8217s rally crews travelled to the Solway Coast near Dumfries for the next round of the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship (STRC) on Saturday August 4.Again the crews were blessed with decent weather at the Dundrennan training camp for the eight stages.

And he is well aware that Labour must recapture votes in places like the Doon Valley if it is to regain power at Holyrood and Westminster. “This is precisely the kind of constituency we need to win back,” admitted the Scottish Labour Party leader. He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

Four examples of these keeps survive in a ruinous state around Innerleithen and Traquair.\nThe walls themselves cannot speak so I have turned to Innerleithen \u0026amp Traquair, Past and Present, with an Angler\u0026rsquos Guide to the Tweed and its Tributaries (Second Edition \u0026ndash 1867), commonly called Smail\u0026rsquos Guide as it was published by Innerleithen printer Robert Smail.\nElibank Castle: \u0026ldquoAbout a mile east of Bold is Juniper Bank, near which \u0026ndash a considerable way up the hill \u0026ndash is the ruin of Elibank Tower, the ancient seat of the Murrays of Elibank, and famous for the story of Muckle-mouthed Meg, in which young Scott of Harden figured so conspicuously. (Smail\u0026rsquos Guide, pp. 96)\nCardrona Tower: \u0026ldquo...Cardrona was for many ages...the property of a family of the name of Govan, chiefs of the name, one of whom, Laurence of Govan, was Sheriff of Traquair in 1358. They resided in the old Tower on the hill, which is now in ruins. The Govans continued in possession of Cardrona until the latter end of the seventeenth century, when it was purchased by Mr Williamson, writer in Peebles, and Town Clerk of that burgh.

This was granted, and the work of demolition was soon begun. The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey. (Smails\u0026rsquo Guide, pp. 15 \u0026ndash 16)\nNether Horsburgh Castle: \u0026ldquo...we find that the lands of Easter Horseburgh, then called Schelynelaw, together with lands of Traquair and Innerleithen were, in 1634, in the hands of John Stewart of Traquair, who in that year was served heir to his brother Robert. The tradition in the family [Horseburgh] is that this part of the property was sold to defray the expenses of a lawsuit which had arisen between two brothers.\nAt Nether Horsburgh there are the remains of an old tower or keep, which used to be called Shillinglaw Tower. Tradition is silent respecting it, but it was probably built about the time the lands came into the possession of the Stewarts [sometime after 1550].

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The proposal to turn the library, which as built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0027s Aldhammer House, were first put to the public in June 2016.  But they were criticised by Prestonpans Community Council, which said merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial. Its \u0026lsquolife expectancy\u0026rsquo is approximately 50 years."},{"url":null,"title":"famous-old-east-lothian-football-club-revived","story":"  The newly revived Wallyford Bluebell football team has already won the John Whyte Memorial Trophy, awarded to the champions of the five-a-side tournament hosted by Musselburgh Athletic Football Club at Olive Bank during the Musselburgh Festival.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.

Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8262375.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8263378.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.

Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

She added: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom outraged every day by something our president has done or said or left undone or neglected, or who he has recently bullied on Twitter or television.  \u0026ldquoFor me, sometimes, I think I\u0026rsquom just so fundamentally my mother\u0026rsquos daughter that I\u0026rsquom far more outraged by the Trump administration ripping children away from their families at the border and not having reunified those children with their families now for months, than I am about anything he has ever done to my families.  She continued: \u0026ldquoIn some ways I think this is the greatest sin of the moment in our country and we very much are doing everything we can to stop this from happening.  Ms Clinton, who was just 12 when her father Bill Clinton entered the White House, spoke of how critics made fun of her looks and referred to her as a dog.  \u0026ldquoI feel incredibly protective of Barron Trump, who is now 12 years old, the same age that I was, she said.  \u0026ldquoI disagree with his father on everything but people have made fun of, bullied him, for his appearance, or for him being more private.  \u0026ldquoEqually I have no patience for that because he\u0026rsquos a child and he deserves a childhood as every child does."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8147037.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coronation-streets-jim-mcdonald-swaps-broad-northern-irish-tones-for-scottish-accent","story":"  But Charles Lawson is set to take on another iconic role when he plays Inspector Rebus in a new touring stage production.  Fans of the gruff detective created by author Ian Rankin can see the Northern Irish actor, 58, follow in the footsteps of John Hannah and Ken Stott when he portrays the hardbitten Edinburgh case-cracker.  Edinburgh-based Rankin, who has penned more than 20 Rebus novels, said: \u0026ldquoCharles was mooted and I thought I would get a few comments from Scottish fans, because he\u0026rsquos from Northern Ireland, said Ian.  \u0026ldquoThe play\u0026rsquos producer and Rona Munro, who I\u0026rsquove written the story with, had seen him on stage and both said he was terrific. He is an actor and actors can do voices, plus he\u0026rsquos worked in Scotland before and everyone is sure he can do it.  \u0026ldquoHe has the physical presence needed and he can certainly act like Rebus would act. Plus he\u0026rsquos a big name \u0026ndash people who might not like Rebus but enjoy a night at the theatre will see Charlie Lawson is in it and might come along.  \u0026ldquoThere have been so many incarnations of the character \u0026ndash two on television, and many more doing the audiobooks and radio \u0026ndash so he isn\u0026rsquot set in stone. Every actor brings something different to the role, which is interesting to me as the writer. Of course, I have my own version of Rebus in my head. \u0026ldquo Rankin has yet to meet the new Rebus due to their busy schedules.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried a few times but it\u0026rsquos not happened as of yet. I\u0026rsquom going down to Birmingham, where the play opens, next month and I have tickets for the first night in Edinburgh, too \u0026ndash my wife surprised me with tickets for my birthday.  Ian co-wrote his first stage play for The Lyceum in Edinburgh a few years ago, but hadn\u0026rsquot considered returning to that medium until he was approached by a producer. He then wrote an original piece with playwright Rona Munro.  The reported revival of the TV series, meanwhile, is still being worked on by a screenwriter.  But Rebus will be returning in his original format in October when the 22nd novel in the series, In A House Of Lies, will be published."},{"url":null,"title":"modern-manners-and-etiquette-a-guide","story":"  You sometimes hear older people complain that manners aren\u0026rsquot what they used to be, particularly now that technology rules so many areas of our lives. And clearly etiquette in some areas of life isn\u0026rsquot as formal or strict as it used to be.  But situations like buying rounds, splitting the bill after a meal, smartphone etiquette, deciding whether or not to offer someone your seat on the bus and navigating the world of online dating can be a minefield. And it all becomes even more complex when you consider changing social norms across gender, race and sexuality, not to mention the of growth of social media and identity politics.  \u0026ldquoThe fundamentals of manners and etiquette have stayed the same for hundreds of years, says etiquette coach William Hanson, author of The Bluffers Guide to Etiquette. \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s all about considering other people and avoiding being selfish. Good manners will always be ageless, timeless, classless and priceless.  Meanwhile, columnist and social media expert Shona Craven believes technology can be unfairly blamed for a perceived decline in manners.  \u0026ldquoI agree that four people round a table looking at their smartphones looks pretty anti-social, she says. \u0026ldquoBut we forget that technology can enhance social situations too. After all, phones are connected to people.  With all this in mind, over the next two weeks we\u0026rsquoll be asking William and Shona to share their advice on how to cope with a range of common modern etiquette dilemmas.  Is it acceptable to get your smartphone out during a meal or when you\u0026rsquore having a drink with someone in the pub?  William says: No matter how important smartphones are in our lives, there is a time and a place for them. If you\u0026rsquove arranged to be out socially with friends or family the least they can expect is that you spend the time talking to them and not scrolling through social media or doing emails. We all have busy lives but if your life is so busy you need to be looking at your smartphone every two minutes, cancel or rearrange.  Lots of what we do on our phones isn\u0026rsquot as important as we think it is. Does answering a message right now really matter that much? If you must look at your phone, then at least make your excuses and go to the toilet.  Shona says: The idea of \u0026ldquoput your phones away is too prescriptive. You\u0026rsquore supposed to be having fun, it\u0026rsquos not the school classroom. For some people having their phone on the table is a comfort blanket. Also, many of us use them as a watch. Whether it\u0026rsquos rude to look at your phone while you\u0026rsquore with someone depends on the interaction. If you\u0026rsquore looking up the name of something as part of a conversation, then arguably you\u0026rsquore adding to the one-to-one interaction rather than detracting from it.  But if you go to look at the time, spot a message from someone else and turn your attention to that, it becomes rude. It can be hard to resist answering messages, but people need to be disciplined.  Public transport etiquette. Should you always thank the bus driver? Do you have to queue for the bus? When should you give up your seat?  William says: If you have contact with the driver and walk past him or her, you should acknowledge them and say hello or thank you. It\u0026rsquos rude to do otherwise.  You should offer a seat to anyone who looks like they need it more than you \u0026ndash usually the elderly of either gender, ladies who are pregnant, or someone that has sprinted to catch the bus (even someone young) and looks like they could do with a seat. I live in London and I rarely get a seat but when I do I\u0026rsquom always looking out for someone who needs it more.  People tend to be more reticent about offering their seat these days in case they offend anyone. Regardless of whether you are male or female, young or old, if you are offered a seat and don\u0026rsquot want it, then don\u0026rsquot snap or be cross, just say \u0026ldquothank you, I\u0026rsquom fine. We must remember that chivalry is a two-way street.  Shona says: Not queuing for the bus queue risks tuts, murmurs and even elbows. But in a busy city, how do you know who is getting on the same bus as you and whether they will flag yours down? It\u0026rsquos a minefield. Most of the time the bus won\u0026rsquot be full and everyone will get on, so there\u0026rsquos no need to queue. And all the \u0026ldquoyou go, no you go only holds things up. Knowing who to offer a seat to is tricky. Is that woman pregnant or just overweight? Older people don\u0026rsquot always want to be treated as frail, while younger people could have an unseen disability. People shouldn\u0026rsquot have to ask for a seat and I\u0026rsquod like to see a system introduced \u0026ndash maybe with a lanyard? \u0026ndash that indicates to fellow passengers you would like a seat.  Do you always have to tip? What\u0026rsquos the best way to split a bill? And are rounds in the pub the fairest way to buy drinks?  William says: Only tip of you are 100 per cent happy with the service. Adding on a service charge should be voluntary: if you get good service, you tip. Indeed, this encourages good service. Even if a charge is automatically added and you get poor service, few British people ever speak up. If the service is bad you are perfectly within your rights to ask people to remove it from the bill.  With reference to splitting the bill, in a group it\u0027s best if everyone has the same number of courses, otherwise it\u0026rsquos not fair to divide the bill by the number of people. Nothing ruins a meal more than the \u0026ldquomine was \u0026pound1.50 cheaper conversation. If you are that person, don\u0026rsquot go out for a meal. If money is that tight, stay in and save up.  As for rounds, it should be like for like. If there are four people, then everyone buys four drinks. The problem these days is that the younger generation don\u0026rsquot drink as much as older people. Some people won\u0026rsquot want four drinks. Rounds seem a bit old fashioned. It\u0026rsquos more acceptable to order for just yourself and your significant other, or put money into a kitty. It can appear a bit anti-social to say \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquoll buy my own, so make sure you say it nicely.  Shona says: I almost always tip \u0026ndash service would have to be very bad not to. But it depends where you are in the world. Overseas many people in the service industry rely on tips for their wages. Do some research and ask locals about the culture and etiquette of wherever you are.  Splitting restaurant bills needs some thought. There are all sorts of social conventions that don\u0026rsquot take into consideration the individual circumstances of your friends, who may have very different levels of income. In a group setting it\u0026rsquos important to point out when someone wasn\u0026rsquot drinking or had fewer courses. We all have a responsibility not to freeload. It\u0026rsquos bad etiquette to say \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot have a starter, but good etiquette to point out that someone else hasn\u0026rsquot.  Should I hold a door open for a woman?  William says: Hold doors open for anyone, regardless of gender. If you\u0026rsquore a woman and someone holds a door open for you, it\u0026rsquos not because you\u0026rsquore a woman, it\u0026rsquos because you\u0026rsquore a human. It\u0026rsquos about politeness \u0026ndash don\u0026rsquot berate the person.  Shona says: Holding the door for someone shows consideration and kindness. Of course I\u0026rsquod hold a door for a guy \u0026ndash everyone should hold them for everyone else.  It can be awkward when you\u0026rsquore walking through a corridor with fire doors and someone holds it for you, but you\u0026rsquore little bit far away and have to run, then say thanks, then do it all over again. Should we start a conversation? Are we friends now? Don\u0026rsquot oblige someone to run down half a corridor just to make yourself look good.  Should you tag someone in a Facebook picture when they don\u0026rsquot look good? Is it OK to be Facebook friends with your boss?  William says: There\u0026rsquos a function on Facebook called Tag Review \u0026ndash turn it on and it won\u0026rsquot tag you until you accept. If you\u0026rsquore in any doubt, even if you think a picture is really funny, ask people before you tag them. Consideration for others is always going to be in fashion, whatever the technology. Don\u0026rsquot just put something up because you think it\u0026rsquoll get you lots of likes.  Facebook is so passe these days anyway \u0026ndash the young, cool, happening people aren\u0026rsquot using it. Parents and grandparents are using it in increasing numbers, but in my experience the older generations use it like teenage girls used to use it 10 years ago \u0026ndash they over-share pictures of their grandchildren and pets and give you unnecessary running commentaries that can be very cringey.  Shona says: Being friends on Facebook becomes a bit awkward when it\u0026rsquos a colleague and there\u0026rsquos an imbalance of seniority. But don\u0026rsquot forget that people use Facebook more sparingly and for different reasons and audiences, and friend requests are easily ignored these days anyway. But if someone ignores your request, don\u0026rsquot mention it. And don\u0026rsquot take it personally. It\u0026rsquos up to them to decide how they use social media and who they want to share that with.  Tagging is a minefield. After a night out, if you don\u0026rsquot tag someone, are you telling them they looked really bad? I tag everyone and they can un-tag themselves if they wish.  Is it Ok to call people \u0026ldquolove, \u0026ldquohen and \u0026ldquodoll, and is it OK to touch people to show affection and/or sympathy?  William says: In a professional environment using such terms is not appropriate \u0026ndash just use someone\u0026rsquos name or title. With friends, if they don\u0026rsquot mind you calling them \u0026ldquodarling, or \u0026ldquolove, that\u0026rsquos fine. You\u0026rsquoll soon see whether they are comfortable with it.  As far as touching goes, in professional environment I\u0026rsquod avoid it completely, especially in this day and age. In a social environment, always make sure touching is from the waist up \u0026ndash never below the waist \u0026ndash on the arm or elbow, or below the shoulder, and only for a second or two.  Shona says: Terms like \u0026ldquohen seem to have died out a bit and often you\u0026rsquoll only hear it used in an ironic way these days. Does this make us a less friendly society? I think there are probably better ways to show humanity than names that might offend people. Some older women especially still use \u0026ldquohen, and surely no one is going to take offence at someone saying \u0026ldquocan you tell me the way to Buchanan Street bus station, hen? or something like that. But it depends on the context. A man using \u0026ldquohen can sound patronising.  As a society we are becoming much more aware of the fact that some people are very uncomfortable with being touched. It very much depends on the social cues. There\u0026rsquos also a perception that digital technology is making it harder for us to pick up on social cues. But I think women in friendships are much more touchy-feely these days. Sometimes it can be awkward when you\u0026rsquove met someone as a friend a couple of times and you\u0026rsquore saying goodbye \u0026ndash should we hug? It depends. It should be a nice thing. If in doubt, just ask.  Online dating  William says: I have done online dating in the past but after meeting my partner (not on the internet) I\u0026rsquom glad I no longer have to. I think the stigma is mostly gone, except maybe in the generations that never had it.  I think there are a few golden rules. Present yourself truthfully in pictures. Don\u0026rsquot have photographs with sunglasses covering your eyes, always use recent photographs and if you\u0026rsquore larger, be honest about it \u0026ndash don\u0026rsquot only use head shots. Be fair. If you\u0026rsquore a lady and you now have short cropped hair, don\u0026rsquot use pics where you have long flowing locks.  If you turn up for a date and think \u0026ldquoabsolutely no way, give the person a shot. Nothing makes you feel worse than when someone cuts a date obviously short. I actually made some good friends through online dating.  Online dating by its very nature is daunting and there\u0026rsquos always going to be a worry over whether someone is hiding something. Managing expectations is also important. If a date goes well and you\u0026rsquore going to be on a plane and unable to contact them tomorrow, tell them that.  Shona says: I think the most important thing is to try to treat others as you would wish to be treated. The problem comes when people have different expectations. The key thing is to try not to take things to heart. Don\u0026rsquot behave recklessly towards someone you don\u0026rsquot know because you\u0026rsquove had bad experiences in the past. It\u0026rsquos easy for women in particular to get very cynical about things. I\u0026rsquove heard friends say \u0026ldquoall the men on this site are horrible \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos not fair. You can\u0026rsquot generalise. Online dating opens up a world of possibilities and although you have three bad experiences in a row, the next person could be a breath of fresh air. People get negative and frustrated. Take a break rather than becoming too bitter and behaving badly to someone who doesn\u0026rsquot deserve it.  The Tinder generation can be very clinical \u0026ndash it can feel like an exchange of CVs and removes a certain amount of the magic, seeming cold and functional.  Swiping left and right is very superficial, obviously, but if you go on a date with someone that\u0026rsquos different. If you don\u0026rsquot want to see them again then you have the potential to hurt their feelings. Lead by example and don\u0026rsquot stoop to the level of the worst treatment you\u0026rsquove had.  It only takes a few minutes to compose a nice text to let someone down gently rather than just ghosting them [pretending they don\u0026rsquot exist]. At least they will know how they stand and maybe have a little more optimism about moving on to the next date.  But if you don\u0026rsquot hear from someone, try not to take it to heart and don\u0026rsquot over-analyse the reasons. Remember the old adage: maybe he\u0026rsquos just not that into you.

The event, which was titled The Last Dance, took place over Friday and Saturday, and original frontman Donnie Munro took to the stage for the occasion.  Around 52,000 fans flocked to Stirling over the two days, each with their own reasons to say farewell. The tickets had sold out only minutes after going on sale, with fans complaining that they had been snapped up by ticket resellers, for five times the original price.  Runrig, which are known for their Gaelic-language songs as much as the anthems that are sung as a climax to so many special occasions, were formed in 1973 on the Isle of Skye. Their roots have acted as an inspiration for some of their most popular songs, and it\u0026rsquos no surprise that they have a large fanbase hailing from their Hebridean heartland (that word, incidentally, being used as the name of one of their albums, in 1985).  Demand was so great that Scottish airline Loganair put on extra flights from the Western Isles to Edinburgh and Glasgow.  The band, which started by playing wedding receptions, are most widely known for their first single Loch Lomond. The instantly recognisable track spent five weeks in the charts in 1983, and it is still a go-to tune to end parties and weddings. But it is their wider body of work \u0026ndash 14 studio albums in total \u0026ndash that their fans were celebrating last night.  Katherine Street, who attended Friday\u0026rsquos show at Falleninch farm in Stirling, said: \u0026ldquoIt was absolutely fantastic. They played non-stop for over three hours. It was a superb venue with the backdrop of Stirling Castle. It was very well organised, very memorable, and I think the Runrig members were very moved by it.  The appearance of Munro was also a massive selling point. He left the band in 1997 to pursue a career in politics and went on to become a solo performer, but he was back, just like the old times and to the delight of the faithful.  \u0026ldquoDonnie also did a couple of numbers with the Glasgow Island Choir. It\u0026rsquos probably the best one I\u0026rsquove been to, and I\u0026rsquom not a huge Runrig fan, but that was a great night with a great crowd, said Street.  The six-strong band have undoubtedly made a large contribution to Scottish music and culture. The Canadian vocalist Bruce Guthro, who has toured with the band for 20 years, said: \u0026ldquoAll of it has been special. It\u0026rsquos almost impossible to pick certain highlights \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos just been a great journey.  This morning, many will be sad to see the band go their separate ways, but The Last Dance was a fitting send-off, and something that will be remembered for years to come.

Later, he will join Yanis Varoufakis, the economist and former Greek finance minister, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival for a discussion on building a \u0026ldquoprogressive international to counter the nationalist policies of Donald Trump and racist forces in Europe.  Mr Corbyn insists his \u0026ldquobuy British policy \u0026ldquois not turning away from the world, nor some return to protectionism or Trump-style trade wars, but an effort to give communities \u0026ldquoreal control over their local economy.  Mr Varoufakis agrees that globalisation has become unsustainable, but he rejects solutions that stop people and commodities from moving about the planet.  Speaking ahead of his visit to Falkirk, Mr Corbyn said: \u0026ldquoThe next Labour government will reprogramme the economy to deliver an industrial renaissance for Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories have overseen the decline of our industries and farmed out major public contracts overseas that could have supported jobs at home. Meanwhile, the SNP government has not done nearly enough to grow Scotland\u0026rsquos industrial base or the green economy.  \u0026ldquoA lack of support for manufacturing is sucking the dynamism out of our economy, pay from the pockets of workers and any hope of secure well-paid jobs from a generation of our young people.  \u0026ldquoLabour will use the public sector\u0026rsquos enormous buying power to support workers and industries by buying in Britain whenever possible. We will boost Scottish manufacturing, which will support jobs and living standards in the wider economy, strengthen our capacity to export, and expand our tax base. It\u0026rsquos time the Scottish people had a government with the determination to create an economy that works for the many, not the few.  But the SNP said Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos the Labour leader\u0026rsquos support for a \u0026ldquojobs-destroying Tory hard Brexit was a threat to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and a \u0026ldquototal betrayal of working people.  Ian Blackford, the party\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, said Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquofantasy claims on the economy were \u0026ldquosimply not credible given the \u0026ldquocatastrophic impact a hard Brexit would have on jobs, businesses, living standards, and economic growth.  He called on Mr Corbyn to join the SNP in fighting to protect membership of the EU single market and customs union.  Mr Blackford said: \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos support for a jobs-destroying Tory hard Brexit is by far the biggest threat to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and long term prosperity and would deal a devastating blow to the incomes and living standards of millions of Scottish families.  \u0026ldquoIt is a total betrayal of working people, who have already been hit in the pocket by Brexit as prices rise, and it would be catastrophic for Scottish businesses and economic growth, leaving the whole country poorer and worse off.He added: \u0026ldquoJeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos fantasy claims on the economy are simply not credible while Labour continue to back the Tories\u0026rsquo reckless hard Brexit plans.  \u0026ldquoWe know from UK Government, Scottish Government, and wider analysis that a hard Brexit could hit Scottish GDP by up to 9 per cent, costing Scotland over \u0026pound12.7 billion a year, a loss equivalent to over \u0026pound2,300 for every person in the country, with around 80,000 jobs at stake.  \u0026ldquoInstead of backing the Tories again, Labour must finally join the SNP in fighting to protect our crucial membership of the EU single market and customs union. That is the only way to safeguard prosperity and avoid an economic crisis."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8435038.jpg?type=article-full","title":"councils-say-its-not-convenient-to-copy-paris-for-people-caught-short","story":"  The reintroduction of \u0026ldquopissoirs in Paris has sparked a mixed reaction, with some Parisians writing to the town hall in protest.  The new \u0026ldquointelligent urinals are housed in flower boxes, painted bright red, have nearby signs advertising their presence, and have a straw layer that eliminates odour that can be removed and used for fertiliser.  Edinburgh and Glasgow have considered installing pissoirs on a number of occasions, in response to a flood of complaints about public urination, but they failed to make a splash with councillors who fear a similar public backlash.  However, drunk revellers \u0026ndash as well as those with medical conditions or just an inconveniently full bladder \u0026ndash are getting increasingly caught short.  A BBC investigation found a widespread decline in public toilets throughout the UK.    (These public toilets in Glasgow city centre are among those that have been closed in recent years.\u0026nbspPicture:\u0026nbspMichael Boyd)  Glasgow, Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest city, which once exported cast iron \u0026ldquoTemples of Convenience throughout the UK from its Victorian foundries, now maintains just eight public toilets.  Public toilets in Edinburgh have almost halved from 29 in 2010 to 17, despite frequent complaints about public urination in popular nightspots such as the Grassmarket and Cowgate.  Edinburgh announced plans to trial open air urinals in the Grassmarket in 2010, at a cost of \u0026pound9,000 apiece, but the public pissoirs did not emerge. It floated a similar idea for The Meadows in 2013 but the public park remained a urinal free zone.  An Edinburgh Council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWhile the idea of open air toilets has been considered in the past, there are currently no plans to introduce these in Edinburgh.  Aberdeen City Council is one of the only Scottish councils to successfully introduce public pissoirs in 2011, but they were withdrawn last year after the cost of maintaining them soared.  In a letter, a council community safety officer said: \u0026ldquoThe decision originally came due to environmental services no longer being able to collect and return the pissoirs as their vehicle required replacing.  \u0026ldquoThe cost implications of purchasing a new vehicle just to allow this service to continue was huge compared to the standard specification of vehicle they required.  \u0026ldquoThis, along with their recalculation of internal charges, wages, hours, meant there would be an increased internal cost from \u0026pound9,000 per annum to more than \u0026pound35,000 per annum.  An Aberdeen City Council spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe urinals were introduced around 2008 and attracted no strong comment, either approving or disapproving they were well used however. There were no comments with regard to equality and indeed figures had shown that urinating in public was an issue almost exclusively among men. The initiative ended when the particular mode of transport used to move the urinals was no longer available.  Raymond Martin, managing director of the British Toilet Association, said it was time to put toilet provision on par with other public services that cater for people\u0026rsquos basic needs.\u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos five things we need to do as human beings \u0026mdash eat, drink, sleep, breath and do the toilet, he said. \u0026ldquoGoing to the toilet is as important as eating, sleeping, breathing and drinking, he said. \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot get rid of the poisons from your body you die.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been saying to the Government, we don\u0026rsquot need high-speed trains, we don\u0026rsquot need extra aircraft carriers, but we have people with medical conditions, pregnant mums, families with young children, people who pay their taxes, who have nowhere to go if they need to perform a vital human function when they\u0026rsquore out on the street.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove spoken to politicians about it and they say, \u0026lsquoWell, there\u0026rsquos plenty of bars they can go to\u0026rsquo. Bars? That\u0026rsquos their answer. Anyone under 18 can\u0026rsquot go in a bar. Single mums can\u0026rsquot go into a bar.\u0026ldquoPregnant women or lone females might not be comfortable going into a bar. People from a religious or ethnic background who don\u0026rsquot drink alcohol can go into bars. That\u0026rsquos about two-thirds of the population.  \u0026ldquoToilets are about health and wellbeing, public dignity, public decency, equality and social inclusion.  He has urged local authorities to install Urilifts, retractable public urinals that emerge from the ground at night and are installed in some cities in England.  \u0026ldquoYou wouldn\u0026rsquot even know it\u0026rsquos there during the day because it retracts into the pavement, but at 10pm you press a button and it rises out of the payment on an electronic pile, he said.\u0026ldquoIt has three concave sides so a gentleman can stand up against it and urinate.  \u0026ldquoSome are at major road junctions but it\u0026rsquos nearly impossible to see what\u0026rsquos going on, beyond a man standing at a structure.  \u0026ldquoThere are probably about 40 of these devices in Britain, including London, Winchester and Belfast in Shaftesbury Square and it works very well.  \u0026ldquoPeople\u0026rsquos initial reaction is, \u0026lsquoWhat? \u0026lsquoWe don\u0026rsquot want people peeing the streets!\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquoBut people are already peeing \u0026mdash and defecting \u0026mdash in shop doorways and they\u0026rsquore causing a bigger problem because squads have to go out and clean it up.\u0026ldquoSome shopkeepers refuse to clean it because they pay their taxes to councils who are responsible for cleaning it.  The Pop Up Toilet Company also supplies facilities with doors as a safe option for women to use late at night.\u0026ldquoYou can\u0026rsquot really open public toilets late at night because of the danger from drug users, drunk people, or the risk of attack, said Mr Martin.  \u0026ldquoWe recognise that you need something for girls, some of whom are running up dark alleyways in the middle of the night to pee which is frightening.  \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot want my daughter running up a dark alleyway where they could be molested or injured because they can\u0026rsquot see properly.  \u0026ldquoThe Urilift costs \u0026pound25,000 to buy but it\u0026rsquos self cleaning as when the unit goes back into the ground it cleans the walls.  Mr Martin said the provision of public toilets should be a central government priority if the postcode lottery of provision throughout the UK is to be ended.  \u0026ldquoThe Government doesn\u0026rsquot give councils any money to provide public toilets and it never has, he said.  \u0026ldquoThere is no legislation that says councils have to provide public toilets.  The council has not written any legislation other than legislation affecting cafes and restaurants.  \u0026ldquoCouncils have provided toilets for years because they don\u0026rsquot want residents to use parks, gardens, beaches and public spaces in towns and cities and they don\u0026rsquot want people urinating in the streets and exposing themselves in public.  \u0026ldquoCouncils were happy to pay for it until 2011, when the Government cut council budgets by 20 per cent and most of them closed public toilets at a stroke.  \u0026ldquoThe council has mandatory duties such as cleaning the streets, fixing the roads and education \u0026mdash and toilets come under discretionary services alongside things like park benches, litter bins and flowerbeds.  \u0026ldquoThe Audit Commission used to keep figures on the number of fines issued for public urination, but they stopped it some time ago. The Government had \u0026ldquo washed its hands of public toilets, he added."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2616913.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-football-manager-david-moyes-made-man-utd-worry-more-about-their-opponents","story":"  That\u0027s the take of former United captain Rio Ferdinand, who has spoken about the Scot\u0027s ill-fated stint at Old Trafford after taking over from Sir Alex Ferguson.  The Scot inherited a Premier League-winning winning squad, but could only guide United to seventh the following season and was sacked before the close of the 2013/14 campaign.  Ferdinand says that Moyes, who is now in the running for the US national team manager\u0027s position, introduced a new mentality into the dressing room that proved a shock at Old Trafford.    \"Even the mindset in one of the training sessions, I hope I\u0027m not speaking out of line here toward David Moyes, but our mindset we were never worried about the opposition [before],\" said the former England international.  \"We never set out thinking we need to contain the opposition, we\u0027re going to try and win this game based on what we\u0027re good at.  \"But I remember the first couple of games against Liverpool and Chelsea, we were talking more about Hazard and Coutinho than we were about our own attacking tactics.  \"There\u0027s doubt and players there looking at each other thinking \u0027This isn\u0027t us.

As football\u0026rsquos bosses make their minds up, Susan Aitken, the leader of Glasgow City Council, has written to the SFA president with a series of suggestions for improvement and reasons why Hampden should be the winner.  She said that if the stadium owners were to make a valid application for safe standing areas, there would be \u0026ldquono obvious barriers to it being given the go-ahead by the council.  Fans complain the view from behind the goals in the east and west stands is poor and the stadium lacks atmosphere.  If the suggestion was taken up, it could see thousands of fans standing for Scotland internationals and for domestic cup finals and the semi-finals.  Ms Aitken has sought to address concerns of fans whose match-day experience has not been positive with the behind the goal areas a common complaint.  In a survey of supporters, it was found that 40 per cent said the experience was bad or very bad.  She said: \u0026ldquoA regular discussion point about Hampden is the capacity to enhance the fan experience, particularly the sight lines at the east and west ends of the stadium.  Ms Aitken said that she did not believe that significant structural change was the only way to resolve the criticisms.  She added: \u0026ldquoOne of the most significant developments in fan experience in recent years has been pioneered in Glasgow, with Celtic Park successfully operating a safe standing area for the past two seasons.  \u0026ldquoInterest in whether a similar scheme would appeal to other clubs and fans has not been limited to our other clubs in the city.  \u0026ldquoIndeed there has been correspondence from local authorities and senior clubs from across the UK, seeking more information about how we have facilitated safe standing in the city.  Ms Aitken gave encouragement to a bid for safe standing and the council has already given permission for Celtic\u0026rsquos safe standing area, occupied by the Green Brigade fans group.  She said \u0026ldquoWere an application for a standing area at Hampden submitted to Glasgow City Council, providing it met all the relevant safety, stewarding and accessibility criteria, there would be no obvious barriers to the bid being approved by the authority.  Celtic Park is currently the only stadium in Scotland with a safe standing area, with 2,600 rail seats which allow standing and then seats when required for European matches.  There are no safe standing areas in England, where it is prohibited following the Taylor report into the Hillsborough disaster.  If applied for and approved, it could mean a return to thousands of fans standing behind the goals at one or both ends of Hampden.  The SFA board will meet next week to discuss a bid by Hampden Park to retain its national stadium status and by the Scottish Rugby Union for a deal to host matches at Murrayfield.  Ms Aitken also said that Fan Zones could be introduced to improve the match-day experience.  She added: \u0026ldquoFan Zones are a growing part of the footballing landscape and will be a key aspect of the fan experience for Euro 2020.  \u0026ldquoThis move towards providing a family-focused platform for improving the match-day experience is broadly welcomed by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"children-with-learning-difficulties-losing-out-in-tests","story":"  Feedback on the roll-out of the literacy and numeracy assessments also called for improvements for pupils with visual impairments.  The concerns emerged shortly after the launch of a national campaign to derail the tests in P1, backed by national charities, teaching unions and parents groups.  The tests in P1 are part of a raft of new assessments, with further testing in P4, P7 and S3. The Scottish Government argues testing in the first year of primary gives an idea of what level pupils are at when they come to school. But critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils.  Fresh concerns over their suitability for pupils with additional support needs emerged from a freedom of information request to CALL Scotland, an organisation based at Edinburgh University which helps pupils overcome barriers to education.  An email from Professor John Ravenscroft, who specialises in childhood visual impairment, said there were problems with presentation, the length of text in some questions and compatibility with pupils used to traditional Braille.  Mr Ravenscroft said that in one extreme case a child spent the equivalent of two days completing the tests.  Also included in the release is a list of concerns from CALL Scotland staff who carried out testing on the new system in May this year, eight months after they were introduced in schools across Scotland.  Noted problems included distracting features, unclear instructions and technological features not working properly.  A further document, sent to Call Scotland by a local government worker, said initial difficulty levels were \u0026ldquotoo challenging for children with numeracy difficulties.  A Scottish Government spokesman said the assessments had been designed to be as accessible as possible and were compatible with a large variety of devices.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is important because it means learners are able to complete the assessments using the tools familiar to them from everyday classroom practice - such as the screen readers used by visually impaired pupils.  Additional measures include having accessibility text embedded within questions for the visually impaired.  The spokesman said a number of improvements would be made."},{"url":null,"title":"irish-actor-swaps-coronation-st-role-to-be-stage-rebus","story":"  But Charles Lawson is set to take on another iconic role when he plays Inspector Rebus in a new touring stage production.  Fans of the gruff detective created by author Ian Rankin can see the Northern Irish actor, 58, follow in the footsteps of John Hannah and Ken Stott when he portrays the hardbitten Edinburgh case-cracker.  Edinburgh-based Rankin, who has penned more than 20 Rebus novels, said: \u0026ldquoCharles was mooted and I thought I would get a few comments from Scottish fans, because he\u0026rsquos from Northern Ireland, said Ian.  \u0026ldquoThe play\u0026rsquos producer and Rona Munro, who I\u0026rsquove written the story with, had seen him on stage and both said he was terrific.

Plus he\u0026rsquos a big name \u0026ndash people who might not like Rebus but enjoy a night at the theatre will see Charlie Lawson is in it and might come along.  \u0026ldquoThere have been so many incarnations of the character \u0026ndash two on television, and many more doing the audiobooks and radio \u0026ndash so he isn\u0026rsquot set in stone. Every actor brings something different to the role, which is interesting to me as the writer. Of course, I have my own version of Rebus in my head. \u0026ldquo Rankin has yet to meet the new Rebus due to their busy schedules.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried a few times but it\u0026rsquos not happened as of yet.

Ian co-wrote his first stage play for The Lyceum in Edinburgh a few years ago, but hadn\u0026rsquot considered returning to that medium until he was approached by a producer. He then wrote an original piece with playwright Rona Munro.  The reported revival of the TV series, meanwhile, is still being worked on by a screenwriter.

Fresh figures also show that flats are the most desirable property type, normally selling for \u0026pound25,000 above the asking price, followed by terraced houses which sell for \u0026pound21,000 more, and semi-detached houses which sell for \u0026pound7,000 more.  However, data shows that owners of detached homes tend to struggle to sell their properties at the price advertised \u0026ndash with properties typically going for \u0026pound25,000 less than the initial asking price. The average price of a detached home was \u0026pound257, 918 \u0026ndash 9% less than the asking price of \u0026pound283, 378.The report refers to the difference between what sellers hope to sell their properties for and the price they actually achieve as the Reality Gap.  Martin Devlin, head of sales at s1homes, said: \u0026ldquoThe confidence from buyers is igniting the demand for property in Scotland, reflected in the fact that most properties are selling over the asking price. However, in some tiers of the market, sellers need to be able to justify, and be realistic about, their asking price and expectations.  Glasgow, Dunbartonshire and Edinburgh continue to be hot spots, with properties typically selling for \u0026pound22,000 and \u0026pound23,000 above their asking price.  Commenting on Glasgow\u0026rsquos performance, Barry Chuwen, director of MQ Estate Agents, said: \u0026ldquoThe second quarter of 2018 continues to be very positive with sales regularly exceeding home report values throughout the various districts, with a constant need for properties as the enquiry levels exceed availability of stock often resulting in closing dates. 2018 expectations are for another very productive year with excellent sales prices and swift turnaround times.  Pauline Smith, senior property manager from Watt Properties, said that the Edinburgh market showed no sign of slowing down. She said: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh\u0026rsquos property market continues to strengthen with a 1.78% increase in the average asking price and the amount of properties available increasing. This is reflected in the average selling price having stayed fairly constant in 2018. A busy summer is indicating that demand for properties in Edinburgh remains buoyant.  Other parts of the country fared less well. In Argyll \u0026amp Bute, East Renfrewshire, West Lothian and South Lanarkshire, East Lothian and Falkirk, buyers can pay less than the average asking price.  Eric Curran, managing partner of chartered surveyor firm DM Hall and former chairman of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS Residential Property Professional Group board, advised sellers to be realistic about the price they wished to market their homes for, adding: \u0026ldquoSurveyors are looking to manage the expectations of sellers. The problem with the property market is that there are so many micro markets. It all depends on the different types of regional markets.  \u0026ldquoThe bottom line if you are looking to sell a property is to maintain your property, present it as well as you can, and to make sure it\u0026rsquos marketed properly at a sensible price. If you market a property at a price people are going to like, If you market a property at a price that\u0026rsquos too high, it will sit for a long time on the market and people start to wonder what\u0026rsquos wrong with it. If you market it at a sensible price and you get people to look at it, you build up demand. Somebody will want to purchase it, rather than just see it.  \u0026ldquoSellers have the opportunity to sell their homes at a premium price. There\u0026rsquos no certainty \u0026ndash you really don\u0026rsquot know until you test the market.  Mr Curran said there was less demand for detached properties because of affordability.

Mr Blackford said: \"Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s support for a jobs-destroying Tory hard Brexit is by far the biggest threat to Scotland\u0027s economy and long term prosperity - and would deal a devastating blow to the incomes and living standards of millions of Scottish families.  \"It is a total betrayal of working people, who have already been hit in the pocket by Brexit as prices rise, and it would be catastrophic for Scottish businesses and economic growth - leaving the whole country poorer and worse off.\"  He added: \"Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s fantasy claims on the economy are simply not credible while Labour continue to back the Tories\u0027 reckless hard Brexit plans.  \"We know from UK government, Scottish Government, and wider analysis that a hard Brexit could hit Scottish GDP by up to 9% - costing Scotland over \u0026pound12.7 billion a year, a loss equivalent to over \u0026pound2,300 for every person in the country, with around 80,000 jobs at stake.  \"Instead of backing the Tories once again, Labour must finally join the SNP in fighting to protect our crucial membership of the EU single market and customs union. That is the only way to safeguard prosperity and avoid an economic crisis.\"  Mr Corbyn is to focus on industry and the economy during his visit to Scotland.  Scottish Labour\u0027s Brexit spokesman Neil Findlay said: \"Labour\u0027s six key tests on the Brexit deal will ensure workers\u0027 rights are protected, gives the UK the same benefits we enjoy as members of the single market and allows for a migration system which works in the interests of the economy.  \"The recent Cuts Commission report launched by the SNP removes all pretence that the Nationalists are a centre-left party.  \"The next Labour governments at Holyrood and Westminster will deliver real change with policies to increase child benefit to raise children out of the indignity of poverty and implement a real \u0026pound10 per hour Living Wage to ensure that our economy works for everyone.  \"The dividing line in Scotland is now between Labour\u0027s plan to invest and build an economy that works for the many, not the few, or further austerity with the SNP and the Tories.\""},{"url":null,"title":"humza-yousaf-accuses-scottish-labour-of-hollow-words-over-islamophobia","story":"  Jim Dempster told officials that then transport minister Humza Yousaf may have visited his area, but \"no-one would have seen him under his burka\".

He asked to be given extra diversity training and also visited a mosque and received support from a local imam in a bid to make amends.  However further allegations of racist abuse later emerged, dating from the late 1980s and early 1990s.

One 92-year-old South Korean woman wept and stroked the wrinkled cheeks of her 71-year-old North Korean son.  As they met, Lee Keum-seom asked her son Ri Sang Chol: \"How many children do you have? Do you have a son?\"  Hugging the woman he\u0027d last seen as a child, Mr Ri showed his mother a photo of her late husband, who had stayed behind in the North with him as a boy.  The week-long event is the first of its kind in nearly three years, and was arranged as part of diplomatic efforts to resolve a stand-off over North Korea\u0027s nuclear ambitions.  Most of the participants in the reunions are in their 70s or older and are eager to see their loved ones once more before they die.  Most have had no word on whether their relatives are still alive because they are not allowed to visit each other across the border or even exchange letters, phone calls or emails.  About 90 elderly South Koreans, accompanied by their family members, will have three days of meetings with their North Korean relatives before returning to the South on Wednesday. A separate round of reunions from Friday to Sunday will involve more than 300 other South Koreans, according to Seoul\u0027s unification ministry.  During Monday\u0027s meetings, many elderly Koreans held each other\u0027s hands and wiped away tears while asking how their relatives had lived. They showed photos of family members who were not able to attend the meetings.  Han Shin-ja, a 99-year-old South Korean woman, was at a loss for words after she reunited with her two North Korean daughters, both in their early 70s.  Not knowing their separation would be permanent, she had left them behind in the North during the war while fleeing south with her third and youngest daughter.  Before this week\u0027s reunions, nearly 20,000 people had participated in 20 rounds of face-to-face reunions since 2000. Another 3,700 exchanged video messages with their North Korean relatives. None of them had a second chance to see or talk with their relatives."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-ministers-urged-to-avoid-childish-rail-nationalisation","story":"  The SNP promised in its 2016 Holyrood manifesto it would \u0026ldquoensure that a public sector operator was able to bid for the ScotRail franchise currently held by Dutch-firm Abellio.  It is understood state-owned ferry operator CalMac is being teed up for the role, with rail unions pushing hard for the change behind the scenes.  However in a new report, former UK Labour transport minister Tom Harris said fares and punctuality, not nationalisation, were the priorities for passengers.  He argued that, despite publicity over problems in the rail industry, the Scottish system was well-run and highly-rated by passengers, with most delays due to the UK-wide nationalised infrastructure company Network Rail, rather than the franchise holder.  He said it would be \u0026ldquoexpensive, childish and counter-productive to remove the private sector on ideological grounds, given improvements in the last 15 years.  If the franchise system were to be changed, ministers should switch to a concession system, paying a private operator a fixed fee to run trains, not nationalisation.  Under a concession scheme, the public purse would bear the risk of any losses, but also stand to gain from any profits, rather than the train operating company.  He said Network Rail should also undergo a \u0026ldquoradical shake-up, making its Scottish operation accountable to the Scottish operator rather than the Department of Transport.  Mr Harris insisted his report, commissioned by Abellio, was independently produced.  The report said the private sector had brought about a \u0026ldquorailway renaissance though new disciplines, strategies and flexibility, but admitted the gains were \u0026ldquodifficult to quantify.  Polling by the Mark Diffley Consultancy and Research found just 17 per cent of passengers thought the rail network as a whole prioritised their needs.  Value for money was their top priority, with 53 per cent rating it as \u0026ldquoessential politicians should therefore focus on prices and punctuality, not structural reforms, the report said.  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos political parties will gain more credit by addressing this area than they will by leading a debate about who should own the trains for which passengers believe they\u0026rsquore paying too much, the report, \u0026lsquoIs Scotland on the Right Track?\u0026rsquo, said.  \u0026ldquoIt is not too late to request that when the railways become the subject of political debate, that dogmatism and ideology be relegated and placed underneath a respect for actual facts.  Mr Harris said: \u0026ldquoFor the whole of this century we have seen a remarkable railway renaissance. Our polling research has shown that the public in general are complimentary about the performance of Scotland\u0026rsquos railways. However, there are problems, and those problems have led to some politically charged calls for blanket nationalisation.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government should not ignore this, but also it should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. If it feels the need to change the franchise model, it should consider moving to a concession model where the government shoulders both profit and risk, but the private sector runs the service.  \u0026ldquoIt would be expensive, childish and counter-productive to dispense with the clear and indisputable benefits of private sector involvement in our railways, without which we would not have experienced the renaissance we have seen.  Scottish Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: \u0026ldquoNationalisation isn\u0027t some magic bullet - as anyone who remembers the days of British Rail knows full well.  \u0026ldquoWhat Scotland needs is a competitive structure for the railways which offers affordable fairs and a quality service. There\u0026rsquos no shortage of companies willing to do this, but it requires strong oversight from the SNP government to ensure that happens.  \u0026ldquoThat strength has been missing in recent years, and commuters have had to live with the consequences. As Tom Harris says, the job is to improve the way the current structure works, not to go back to the failures of the past.  The Scottish Government said it expected to make an announcement on a public sector operator bid to run the ScotRail franchise \u0026ldquoin the near future.  A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoThe Harris report acknowledges the importance of securing best value for the public purse from our public contracts. Our fundamental procurement principles of transparency and fairness will continue to be applied consistently to future rail franchises, as will our approach to consultation with the public and key stakeholders."},{"url":null,"title":"brewdog told to pay sacked worker 12k","story":"        A former employee of Ellon-based brewers, BrewDog, has won his employment tribunal case after being sacked because he was losing his eyesight!

And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require.

Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117107.jpg","title":"Does the restored Iron Wellie in Wick have healing powers","story":"\u0026nbspTHE famed Grotto of Massabielle in Lourdes brings in thousands of \"pilgrims\" seeking miracle cures with its alleged healing waters \u0026ndash but could a natural spring on the north side of Wick Bay become a similar beacon for the sick and ailing? Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

No personal information will be gathered as part of this.Evidence suggests that across Scotland more than a quarter of people in education have struggled at some point in the previous year to access sanitary products with some girls and young women having missed school or skipped classes because they didn’t have access to products.The Scottish Government, local authorities and the university and college sectors have therefore committed to providing free access to sanitary products in all schools, colleges and universities in Scotland beginning from the new academic term.Further information can be found at  www.young.scot/periods.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We\u0026rsquore always working together as a community so we feel positive about this award.\"Alness entered the awards last time around but lost out to Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire.However, it is no stranger to national competitions having won Britain in Bloom five times and Scotland in Bloom on four occasions.Ms Wilson, who is also a local Highland councillor, said the High Street offered a great all-round shopping experience.\"We have lots of independent shops and very few chain shops,\" she said.\"Morrisons and Lidl work well with the High Street. They give people their food shopping but they don\u0026rsquot tend to compete with the independent shops.\"They try to work hand-in-hand.\"Last year\u0026rsquos Great British High Street Awards were a big success with hundreds of High Streets being entered.Jamie Stone, Liberal Democrat MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, said Alness was this year\u0026rsquos obvious winner.He said: \"Alness High Street is a beacon of hope for all of us who worry about the decline in our town centres.\"It is a tribute to the fantastic work put in by local people and they richly deserve to win the top prize.\"The awards are run by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and were launched to celebrate local achievements on UK high streets.As well as recognising the best high streets, the awards also aim to celebrate the individual businesses and people who play a \"leading role in making our high streets special\".Andrew Percy MP, parliamentary under-secretary of state and minister for high streets, said: \"The awards are a great opportunity to recognise and celebrate the efforts of small businesses, dedicated individuals and community groups in our area who work hard to make our High Streets great.\"There\u0026rsquos also a chance to win up to \u0026pound10,000 to spend on the local community.\"Applications will close on August 22.

This work means unused golf clubs will now do more rounds again on Scottish golf courses.\"Unwanted clubs can be donated at Muir of Ord, Fortrose and Rosemarkie, Strathpeffer Spa, Tain, Aigas, Bonar Bridge and Ardgay, Castle Stuart and Royal Dornoch.Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it. As part of the promotion we plan to launch a major new three day running/walking/cycling event in 2020.\"Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre. Their volunteers have worked really hard to achieve this.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down.

We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Monday 20 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Norwegian energy firm DNO, which owns just over 28 per cent of Faroe, has requisitioned a meeting of Faroe’s shareholders in an attempt to get its chairman and managing director seats on the board. In a strongly worded response, Faroe’s board said it was “very concerned” by DNO’s action.

BBC Scotland\u0026#8217s head of public policy dismisses claims of increasing public disquiet over alleged bias at the BBC.                “Facts are chiels that winna ding, An downa be disputed.”            If only our national Bard’s words held as true today as they did when he first put pen to paper in 1786. Sadly, in an age where social media is, for many, the communication vehicle of choice, facts are ‘dinged’ on a regular basis and it is increasingly commonplace for the distinctions to be blurred between that which can be verified and that which is simply the stuff of rumour, opinion or even deliberate fabrication.            Earlier this year, the Edelman Trust Barometer, which measures trust across a number of institutions, job sectors and geographical areas, found that over 50 per cent of us worry about fake news. It also revealed that 64 per cent of those interviewed for the survey said they could not distinguish between proper journalism and that which was fake. That must be a cause for concern for us all.In such an environment, where the amount of social media content grows exponentially, day on day, where views are increasingly becoming more polarised and voices more strident in an effort to be heard above the ‘din’, it is not easy for the BBC to stand apart and remain immune. Indeed, as a broadcaster, we are often the subject (some might say ‘target‘) of much of the discourse, with questions regularly asked of our impartiality and independence. The events of the last few weeks have again thrown that discourse into sharp relief.Three weeks ago, alerted to BBC content being posted online without authorisation, action was taken to address what was seen as a copyright infringement by a number of websites. That, in turn, prompted a flurry of correspondence, commentary and criticism, much of it channelled via social media and, indeed, via the media at large (including the BBC’s own television and radio news outlets). The BBC reacted, determining, rightly, that the proper course of action would be to review its practices in respect of ‘political’ content being posted online by third parties and to withdraw its complaints about such postings (action will continue to be taken where pirated copies of BBC content such as comedies and dramas are posted online).Some saw this as an opportune moment to rekindle their arguments about the BBC’s ‘institutional bias’, to give voice once again to their perceptions of a pro-Unionist, pro-establishment, anti-independence stance which they believe the BBC not only embodies but actively promotes. And the arguments, for and against, raged, not only on social media but also in the columns and letters pages of parts of the press.            Indeed, Lesley Riddoch, in her Perspective article (Monday, 13 August) drew attention to what was characterised as a compendium of concerns laid at the door of the BBC, illustrating what she described as increasing public disquiet over its alleged pro-Labour/anti-Nationalist bias, its anti-Labour/Jeremy Corbyn bias, its pro-Conservative bias, the desertion of ‘liberals and lefties’ from the Today Programme audience, a similar desertion by them – and by supporters of Scottish independence – from the Question Time audience...READ MORE: Lesley Riddoch: BBC struggles to accept Scottish independence isn’t a ‘phase’If Lesley is to be believed, I’m surprised anyone, anywhere, is now watching or listening to BBC programmes! But then again, if we are so busy manipulating our news content in favour of one cause or another, maybe we just haven’t noticed that there’s no-one out there consuming it...Frankly, I don’t buy it. Because it isn’t true. The truth of the matter is that audiences do still consume BBC programmes and content. In Scotland. And in great numbers. And they’re not doing that because they don’t trust what they are seeing or hearing. Quite the contrary.            Recent reports from Ipsos Mori and the Oxford University Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism on digital news both saw BBC ranked top for impartial news and as the most trusted news source when compared to other broadcasters, print outlets and social media platforms. Last month, Ofcom’s Media Nations: Scotland report revealed that four in five regular viewers in Scotland rated BBC One’s wide range of quality news highly (78 per cent), above the UK average and above the ratings recorded by audiences in England and Wales. And the early evening edition of Reporting Scotland remains the most watched television news programme in Scotland.So let us allow the evidence, gathered by external, reputable media analysts to provide proper balance in the arguments around the BBC.And that evidence very clearly tells us that audiences value the BBC. They value it as a trusted and authoritative voice, one which is not influenced by political or commercial pressures or by arguments from one side or another of a debate. They value it for being a news provider that will get to the heart of a story to better help audiences understand the forces that shape all of our lives and, in turn, to help us all to make informed decisions about our futures.Does the BBC get it right every time? Of course not. We make mistakes and we occasionally get things wrong, just as everyone does. In her article, Lesley tells us that we have “infuriated not just Yes voters” by failing to report on recent “local pro indy marches across Scotland”. It took BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley to point out to her, on Twitter, that she was wrong – we had reported on them, extensively, and often in stories leading our bulletins on TV, on radio and online (though Lesley’s counter argument to Nick, on Twitter, that “website reports are not broadcasting” does seem at odds with the digital world in which we all live).Nick’s intervention also confounds Lesley’s assertion that BBC journalists are “forbidden from correcting even factual errors for fear of escalating Twitter wars”. If that’s true, someone better alert Nick, Gary Robertson, Douglas Fraser and host of other BBC Scotland journalists who haven’t been afraid to put the record straight where required.            Because our journalists do as they should and ask hard questions of those in power doesn’t reflect a bias against a government or a party in power. It doesn’t mean we favour one side of an argument over another. And it doesn’t mean we shape our news agendas to tell bad news stories rather than tell the truth, as some believe. It means our journalists are doing their job, properly scrutinising the decisions and proclamations of those in power.The issue over BBC content being posted online brought a further consequence, with over 200 people turning up at Pacific Quay in Glasgow last weekend to demonstrate against BBC bias. We offered to talk. That offer still stands. We want to engage, constructively, in dialogue with those who question our journalism or are suspicious of our decision-making. Next year, the introduction of a new BBC TV channel for Scotland, and a new hour-long weeknight news programme, will offer us a significant opportunity to engage further with audiences, to offer more space for dialogue and discussion about the issues that matter. It is important that we all engage and grasp that opportunity, in the same way that it is important that we grasp the opportunity to sit down and talk. We might not, in the end, all agree, but at least we will be better placed to understand each other.Ian Small is the head of public policy and corporate affairs at BBC Scotland"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783471.1534192405!/image/image.jpg","title":"chris bambery how scotland s own occupy movement took over edinburgh 80 years ago","story":"        Frustration and anger at rising inequality is nothing new, as a largely forgotten chapter of Scotland\u0026#8217s history of protest shows, writes Chris Bambery                In June 1933, for three days and nights, jobless protesters occupied the centre of Edinburgh, sleeping out on Princes Street under the windows of the city elite’s gentlemen’s clubs.            An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

It must have taken some guts for John Swinney to agree to spend an hour on BBC Radio Scotland’s Stephen Jardine Programme on Thursday, fielding questions on the mayhem that is the current state of Scottish education. Not as much guts as it would have taken to go on the week before when teachers were still on holiday and free to call in, of course. But even with most of them safely ensconced in the classroom, the encounter was unlikely to be anything other than bruising.            A quick recap of the problems that have reared their heads in the past few weeks alone should give an insight into the scale of the maelstrom Swinney was heading into. But where to start? With the 700 teaching posts that remained unfilled two weeks before the beginning of term, perhaps? Or the escalating row over the standardised testing of P1s? Or with the report showing the dramatic decline in secondary school pupils taking foreign languages as subject choices narrow under the Curriculum for Excellence? Or with the plummeting spirits of teachers who are struggling to cope with an assessment-heavy system?             It is two years since Nicola Sturgeon put her most trusted lieutenant in charge of schools. She said: “Judge me on my education record” and contributors to the radio programme were eager to oblige. Caller after caller went on the attack over recruitment, workload, pay and cuts to learning assistants. One retiring primary head, named only as Susan, said the profession was haemorrhaging teachers. “The working time agreement for teachers is almost a joke,” she said. “There’s no way teachers can do the contracted hours in enough time. The morale is so low.” A principal teacher at a Highland secondary school said the requirement for recording assessments at primary school was bordering on the ridiculous, while a pupil support assistant told him a lack of resources meant children with special needs were being failed. One mother said her ten-year-old daughter, who is unable to go to the toilet unaided, had been left covered in faeces because no learning assistant was available to help her.Swinney has a reputation for unflappability it is probably one of the qualities that secured him his current role. But there is a point at which unflappability veers into complacency, and in his “Crisis? What Crisis?” response to these criticisms, Swinney crossed that line.Failing to acknowledge the depth of people’s concerns, he continued to peddle the same old mantras: that these were “challenging times”, that teaching is “a very busy and demanding life”, but he insisted there was no great problem with morale. He must mix in different circles to me, then. The teachers I know are overwhelmed as they struggle to deal with a toxic mix of high expectations and low resources.            Such was Swinney’s state of denial that when Susan retorted: “I don’t hear anything you’ve said this morning that would convince me you have got a handle on this,” one could only share in her exasperation.To cap it all, the following day it emerged Swinney had approached Finance Secretary Derek Mackay on behalf of Kilgraston School, which is in his constituency, and is concerned about the end of business rates charity relief for private schools. Swinney insisted he was just doing his job as an MSP. But given the SNP has presided over hundreds of millions of pounds of cuts to education budgets, his query and Mackay’s reply – that the school could seek rates relief from the local council – seemed hypocritical, while providing further evidence that the party is often less progressive than it pretends.The SNP’s fingers-in-the-ears routine on education has been going on for years, now. Swinney and his predecessor, Angela Constance managed to block out the warnings of teachers that things were going badly awry with the implementation of CfE and that cuts in learning assistants were adding to overall pressure.            Instead of tackling those problems, he tried to press ahead with controversial reforms to empower headteachers and strip local authorities of more of their control. Such was the lacklustre reception to his flagship Education Reform Bill, he dropped it just before recess. Though some within the profession have warned it could mean creeping privatisation, he is still wedded to it he just believes it will be enacted more quickly without legislation.Swinney is showing the same thrawnness over the issue of standardised assessments time and again teachers have told them such assessments can only lead to league tables and to teaching to the test. Particularly concerning are the ones for P1 pupils. Personally, I don’t understand why these are so distressing for the children involved. Surely they can be presented as a game something they can enjoy. But I do understand that teachers – who spend many hours a week with their pupils – are constantly evaluating their progress. To them, the tests seem unnecessary and consume time that would be better spent on actual learning.At the Edinburgh International Book Festival, teacher-turned-author Alex Beard called for all primary school testing to be scrapped. “I know as a teacher I could teach my students to succeed in their GCSE exam and, when I reflect on that, I realise I wasn’t equipping them with real, long-term abilities, knowledge and skills that they could apply in the future,” he said. If you want an example of how this works consider that at my children’s school, pupils doing music will often play the same piece for two years just to make sure they know what they are doing come the Nat 5s.On recruitment, Swinney claims to have been proactive: he told the Stephen Jardine Programme that measures introduced to attract new teachers included bursaries to encourage people to switch careers and teach in Science, Technology and Maths (STEM) subjects.            But with resources tight, teachers’ take-home pay having fallen in real terms, and only a 3 per cent rise on the table, would making that shift feel like a positive or even viable option? Surely the most effective way to increase recruitment is to make teachers feel valued that can only be done by investing more and – just as importantly – respecting what they have to say. The failure to do so over a protracted period of time means that, as pupils returned to school, teachers were already on the offensive, threatening test boycotts and industrial action. No parent wants their child educated in a system which is in a constant state of upheaval or by people who are so worn down they have lost their passion for their subject. Last week, Swinney ended a column on his education reforms thus: “Every new school year brings an opportunity for a fresh start.” Let’s hope he takes his own words at face value that as pupils settle back in he starts to face up to the reality of the situation. Only when the Scottish Government acknowledges the mistakes that have been made, can it begin to repair the damage done to the profession."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4786402.1534626919!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm cometh the hour cometh the centrist dads and mums too","story":"        Consensus politics will have to resort to radical action to wrest the debate from the extremists, writes Euan McColm                An especially exasperating aspect of contemporary political debate is the tendency of those most passionately involved to ascribe membership of an opposing tribe to anyone who disagrees with them.            If one is not a Scottish nationalist, one must be a British nationalist (with all that implies) if one doesn’t support the politics of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, one must be at the very least a Tory and, quite possibly, a warmonger if one does not favour remaining in the European Union, one must be a fool and likely a racist one at that.            The zealot, consumed by his beliefs, trembling with excitement at the truth he has found, cannot comprehend that not everyone thinks like him. If you are not part of his gang, you must be part of another one. This is how his world works. It’s Us vs Them, and if you’re not one of Us then you must be an active one of Them.In his excellent show at this year’s Edinburgh Fringe, the stand-up Matt Forde identifies the SNP as masters of this technique. Anyone who paid the slightest attention to the 2014 independence referendum will recognise the truth in Forde’s brutally funny routine. Wasn’t it the case that anyone who did not support a Yes vote four years ago was a “red Tory” who wanted to privatise the NHS while investing all the money that might save in nuclear weapons?But when it comes to misrepresenting and then attacking the positions of opponents, the Labour Party makes the SNP look decidedly amateurish. Under the glorious reign of Comrade Corbyn, straw-man production has reached record levels.Those now raising concerns about anti-Semitism in the party should expect to be accused of participation in a cynical campaign. You may slap a Corbynista in the face with countless photos of their leader laying wreaths by memorials to terrorists and they will stand their ground, repeating the lie that he is a victim of the shadowy powers that control the media.Those who enjoy the acquired taste of bitter irony may savour the fact that accusations of anti-Semitism are rejected with the use of one of the classic anti-Semitic tropes.            Before they were hounding Jews – an online campaign belittling the concerns of Jewish MP Dame Margaret Hodge is, at the time of writing, the newly plumbed low to which Corbyn’s loyal foot soldiers have descended – devotees of the dear leader spent most of their time attacking any party members who did not share their enthusiasm for a man who has spent his political career rubbing shoulders with assorted cranks and anti-Semites.There was the shrill approach – anyone who had not given themselves completely to Corbyn was a Blairite, which by implication meant one was in favour of the Iraq War, which meant one was basically a war criminal. These people should leave the Labour Party and join the Conservatives.A gentler – and, I think, more effective – tactic was the creation of the “centrist dad” brand. For very good reasons – the frequent abuse of our disproportionate power, our leading role in economic crises around the world, our sense of entitlement – middle class, middle aged white men were encouraged to shut up and listen. This is not an unreasonable demand.And so describing someone as a “centrist dad” was to point out that he was part of the problem, that everything that’s wrong with the world was down to men like him. It’s difficult to mount a compelling case against that charge. Fortunately, the politics of the centrist dad is not exclusive to centrist dads. There are young activists, experienced women in the House of Commons – Caroline Flint, Liz Kendall, the especially impressive Yvette Cooper – and a new generation of political candidates who could just as easily be described as centrist dads.            Centrist Dadism isn’t really a thing. It’s just centrism, the dad bit is pure sleight of hand.Centrism is deeply unfashionable, right now. It’s not tribal enough, for one thing. It allows for the belief that a political opponent might be speaking and acting in good faith.Look at where we now are. Two divisive referendums – on Scottish independence and membership of the European Union – and a backlash (driven by anger over the Iraq War) against the politics of the New Labour years have created political battalions, prepared to argue black is white in defence of their identity-focused beliefs. Labour Party members are, right now, excusing anti-Semitism in their party. Some are actively propagating it.Meanwhile, the Tory right is quite prepared to accommodate a spot of Islamophobia – always in the name of free speech, you understand.Centrism might be rather squeezed out, it might be ritually mocked by those infected with the disease of certainty, but it is needed now.            Not every person who joins the Labour Party is an anti-Semite but they will have to stomach the truth that some of their comrades are. Not every person who joins the Tory Party is an Islamophobe or a racist but…To commit support to one of the main parties right now is to make peace with some pretty appalling views.Speculation about the creation of a new centrist political party rumbles on. The Liberal Democrat brand, damaged by participation in the 2010-15 coalition with the Tories and not repaired under the comically poor leadership of Vince Cable, means there is certainly space for a party willing to come third in the next general election.The inevitability that a new party would be squeezed by Labour and Tories, alike, remains the stumbling block to its creation.But how long can those who don’t share the extreme views of those who dominate their parties remain and fight internal battles they will not win?If the offer at the next general election is a choice between two varieties of extremists, one variety of extremists will win.It’s time for centrists – dads or not – to break away from the competing cults of British politics."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4786570.1534747594!/image/image.jpg","title":"jeremy corbyn accused of betrayal over post brexit renaissance message","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Jeremy Corbyn has come under attack for launching a four-day tour of Scotland to promote his post-Brexit \u0026#8220built it in Britain\u0026#8221 economic message at a major Scottish manufacturer that has warned about the impact of leaving the single European market.                The Labour leader will pledge to revive British industry after the UK leaves the EU during a visit to Alexander Dennis, the Falkirk bus maker that said a hard Brexit would hold back its growth.            Mr Corbyn will commit a Labour government to “reprogramme the economy” and “deliver an industrial renaissance for Scotland” by ensuring government contracts benefit local manufacturers.            But the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused Mr Corbyn of a “total betrayal of working people” for refusing to back remaining in the single market and customs union.Labour has put revitalising the UK’s industrial sector at the heart of its post-Brexit economic plan. Mr Corbyn has consistently argued that EU state aid rules make it harder for British governments to support domestic industry, leading to major public investment going overseas.In a speech in July, Mr Corbyn said that, under Labour, the UK “will build things here again that for too long have been built abroad because we have failed to invest… doing this will allow us to have greater control over the economy”.However, critics have accused the Labour leader of embracing protectionism, and have pointed to support for state-run public services and domestic industrial production in other European economies.            While in Scotland, Mr Corbyn is expected highlight the case of Burntisland Fabrications, the Fife engineering firm specialising in offshore wind power that has effectively been forced to close with a loss of hundreds of jobs. “The Tories have overseen the decline of our industries and farmed out major public contracts overseas which could have supported jobs at home,” the Labour leader said ahead of his visit. “Meanwhile the SNP government has not done nearly enough to grow Scotland’s industrial base or the green economy.”Mr Corbyn added that Labour would “use the public sector’s enormous buying power to support workers and industries by buying in Britain whenever possible.”But the Labour leader’s choice of Alexander Dennis to start his trip to Scotland drew criticism, after the company’s chief executive told The Scotsman in June that leaving the single market and customs union would harm export opportunities in the EU and drive up the cost of vital components in its supply chain.            Mr Blackford claimed the Labour Party backed a “jobs-destroying Tory hard Brexit” that posed “by far the biggest threat to Scotland’s economy and long term prosperity”.“It is a total betrayal of working people, who have already been hit in the pocket by Brexit as prices rise, and it would be catastrophic for Scottish businesses and economic growth,” the SNP MP said.“A hard Brexit could hit Scottish GDP by up to 9 per cent – costing Scotland over £12.7 billion a year, a loss equivalent to over £2,300 for every person in the country, with around 80,000 jobs at stake.”Mr Blackford added: “Instead of backing the Tories once again, Labour must finally join the SNP in fighting to protect our crucial membership of the EU single market and customs union.”Mr Corbyn will also attend the Edinburgh International Book Festival today, where he will take part in a Q\u0026ampA with the former Greek finance minister Yiannis Varoufakis on The Resurgence of Socialism."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4785609.1534492737!/image/image.jpg","title":"rbs finance chief to step down at end of september","story":"        Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has announced that chief financial officer Ewen Stevenson will step down at the end of September.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nMonday 20 Aug 2018 1:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date. It was installed in 1970 and we have to ensure that we can continue to provide clean, safe, fresh drinking water to our customers locally in the years ahead.\"\nWhile just a trickle of villagers attended the four-hour drop-in session, the development team considered it a fair proportion of the local population, especially as the community council was represented during the consultation exercise.\n\"The feedback so far has been good and very useful and we have discussed various questions and concerns and the process is now under way.\"\nOne of the early callers to study the plans was former community council chairman Bill Carr, who told the Strathy: \"While larger than the current plant, the new buildings do look more \u0027integrated\u0027 and assuming the old site is cleared and landscaped \u0026ndash as they say it will be \u0026ndash this should be good news for Dalwhinnie.\n\"It will be especially good news if there\u0027s some tree-planting around the new works.\n\"And the community could possibly acquire the old site as a village resource. A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nMonday 20 Aug 2018 1:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27430  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“Ahed was persecuted for defending her family and community from brutal, aggressive Israeli oppressors.

Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects. However, there is still much more work to be done. For children like Mark, who have complex congenital heart disease, treatment can be much more difficult.\n  \nMairead, Mark and his family are keen to raise as much awareness and funds as possible and are asking everyone to support in any way they can. You can donate to Mairead or Mark in person or call into any of the following businesses in Ballymena: The Moat Bar, Kockeden Lodge, Credit Union, Willy Allen’s Butchers, The Mace, Ballykeel Chemist, Molly Malone’s Chip Shop and A Star Valeting and Detailing, Ballymena who are running a special offer between August 16 and September 16 - offering full valets for just \u0026pound60 and \u0026pound70 for jeeps and 4x4\u0027s, \u0026pound2 of every full valet will be donated to the cause.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921264.jpg--.jpg?1534230306000\n","title":"plans to extend public realm scheme to greenvale street","story":"  \nPLANS are being considered to extend the Public Realm Scheme to Greenvale Street in Ballymena Town Centre.\n  \nHowever, one local business owner who has been based on the street for 20 years, has hit out at the lack of consultation around the proposals.\n  \nClaire Brennan of Oasis Hair Salon claims she has had to rely on “hearsay” in a bid to find out more about the plans.\n  \nNIE is currently carrying out utility works on the street which is expected to last four weeks.\n  \nClaire said: “I have heard that after the four weeks they are planning to rip the entire street up and replace it as part of the Public Realm Scheme. I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay.

Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tribute call for elisha scott","story":"\n\nTHE\n public vote to name the new road leading to the Olympia Leisure Centre in Belfast is in its final week and SDLP Councillor Donal Lyons is encouraging people to ensure they have their say and to vote for \u0026#8216Elisha Scott Boulevard\u0026#8217.\n\nElisha Scott is a Liverpool football legend and was Belfast Celtic’s most successful manager who also took the club on their tour of the US in 1949 where they defeated the then British champions, Scotland.\n\nCllr Donal Lyons said: “The vote to name this new road closes on this Sunday and the 125th anniversary of Elisha Scott’s birth will be on the 24th of this month, just days after. \n\n“I’m glad that my proposal to name this road after Elisha Scott has been included because despite Elisha being one of the most successful footballers to have come from our city, awareness of his achievements has faded. \n\n“It’s my hope, that by naming this road after Elisha Scott that we can correct this and begin to give him the full and long overdue recognition he deserves.”\n\nGoalkeeper Scott was born just yards from this new road. Cllr Lyons said it It would be fitting if the road was named after one of Belfast’s greatest ever footballers.\n\n“After famously signing for Liverpool FC in 1912 for ‘£1 and the price of the boat trip’, Scott would be a key player in Anfield for an incredible 22 years, making 468 first-team appearances. He holds the record as Liverpool’s longest serving player to this day. The earliest recorded football chant was Liverpool fans cheering his name. Scott is widely considered the first King of the Kop. \n\n“But it’s not just his time in Liverpool that’s worthy of celebrating. Elisha returned to the Donegall Road in 1934 to become player-manager for Belfast Celtic. Over the following 14 years, he would secure 31 trophies with the Grand Old Team, including 10 Irish League titles, six Irish Cups and eight Gold Cups. Belfast Celtic were the powerhouse in local football and the club still retains a loyal and dedicated fan base. \n\n“Scott also knew what mattered in football and when challenged amid worsening sectarian tensions in the 1930s, for fielding a cross community team he responded in his trademark forthright style, ‘I don’t play Protestant players. I don’t play Catholic players. I play good players.’ Scott’s success as both player and manager secured his place in history but his dedication to his club, players and fans ensured his place as a legend of the game.”\n\nYou can vote online at https://dof.belfastcity.gov.uk/NameTheRoadVote/  or by emailing NameTheRoad@BelfastCity.gov.uk with Elisha Scott in the subject and including your name and address.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"exam papers for entire northern ireland schools class lost in post","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We are in contact with the company that the school used to do all we can to trace the missing scripts.\"\n\nMrs McCartney told BBC Radio Ulster\u0027s Nolan Show that the response from the school on result\u0027s day was not good enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Holly was nervous enough and was told by another pupil in the playground that her paper had been lost along with the other students,\" she said.\n\n\"We went up to the school to collect the results. Fortunately Holly has been successful in her place for university, however the grade that she was expecting was an A and she only got a B, and that was given out based on the coursework she did earlier in the year, the course was supposed to be 50% coursework 50% exam.\n\n\"We were absolutely horrified and there was no letter of explanation from the school to us that morning, not even to say what they were going to do or what they had done for us.\n\nShe said that she had been unsuccessful in her attempts to get an explanation from WJEC.\n\n\"It was left up to us as parents to try to find out exactly what was going on and what we could do to try and get some help,\" Mrs McCartney said.\n\n\"I found out that morning she had sat that examination under the Welsh board and I contacted them and only got voicemails and I never got speaking to anybody.\n\n\"We got a letter from school on Saturday morning, a little too late, it should have been sent out when they were aware the exam papers had gone missing on.\"\n\nMrs McCartney said that although her daughter was lucky other pupils may have missed out on university places due to the mixup.\n\n\"It has been a reasonable enough outcome but I am sure there are other kids in her class who may have been turned down by their first choice,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A teacher told us the papers were sent off by first class post, this was to specifications set out by Welsh examination board.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"celtic fan sorry for airport confrontation with novo","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany.

We are reaching thousands more homes and businesses every week, that can now reap the clear and tangible benefits that superfast broadband provides.\n\n\"We are helping to ensure the downfall of the digital divide.\"\n\nMs James said the target was to ensure everyone in the UK has access to fast and affordable broadband by 2020 and there should be nationwide gigabit connectivity by 2033.\n\nClive Selly, chief executive of Openreach, part of BT, said the superfast broadband rollout was one of the country\u0027s great engineering achievements.\n\n\"It is great to see businesses across the UK reaping the benefits of faster broadband speeds,\" he said.\n\n\"We\u0027ve also recently introduced a raft of lower wholesale prices to help drive higher take-up of faster fibre services which will help to further fuel the boost to the UK economy.\"\n\nThe Evaluation of the Economic Impact and Public Value of the Superfast Broadband Programme report said for every £1 invested in superfast broadband, business had seen a £12.28 benefit.\n\nEarlier this year, a report by telecommunications regulator Ofcom found 50,500 premises in Northern Ireland - around 7.5% of the total - are unable to access sufficient broadband service in Northern Ireland. \n\nDecent broadband speed across the UK is set at a download speed of at least 10Mbit/s and an upload speed of at least 1Mbit/s.\n\nThe worst-affected council area of Northern Ireland was Fermanagh and Omagh.\n\nSome 21% of households are still unable to access decent broadband, while some 12% of households in Mid-Ulster affected.\n\nHouseholds in Belfast saw the highest rates of access.\n\nAlthough placed at the bottom of the UK\u0027s regions, Northern Ireland is set for a £150m boost to its broadband network.\n\nThat money was secured as part of the DUP\u0027s confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservative government.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pope in ireland pontiff not visiting ni is a mistake says priest","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It will be the first visit to Ireland by a pope since John Paul II in 1979.\n\n\n \nPope in Ireland: Free Presbyterian cleric says Pope ‘imposter’ and slams Moderator\n\n\n \nPope in Ireland: Archbishop urges Francis to talk of abuse scandal\n \n\n\nIt was Pope John Paul II\u0027s intention to cross the border then and negotiations were still in progress on August 27 when Lord Mountbatten and 18 soldiers were killed in attacks for which the Provisional IRA claimed responsibility. \n\nAfter these killings, the Pope\u0027s programme had to be revised radically and Northern Ireland was crossed off the itinerary.\n\nIn June, when the Papal visit was announced, Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said Pope Francis was \"disappointed\" he wouldn\u0027t cross the border. \n\nThat disappointment is shared by Fr Brian D\u0027Arcy, the Fermanagh-born Passionist priest, who is based in Crossgar in Co Down. \n\nIn an open letter to the Pontiff in the Sunday World, he said: \"I cannot hide my disappointment that you are not coming to the North.\n\n\"I was just as disappointed in 1979, but the evil actions of the IRA in Warrenpoint and in Mullaghmore made it impossible for John Paul II to cross the border. \n\n\n \nMalachi O’Doherty: If Foster met the Pope it would be reciprocation for McGuinness meeting the Queen... though the truth is some nationalists criticising her for not doing so wouldn’t go to see him themselves\n \n\n\n \n\n\"There is no good reason why Francis cannot visit Northern Ireland. It\u0027s a mistake.\" \n\nWhile the Pope is not travelling to Northern Ireland, politicians from all the main parties here will join the celebrations - with the exception of the DUP. \n\nParty leader Arlene Foster declined her invitation saying she would be on a family holiday at the time, and the DUP has said it will not be sending another member in her place. \n\nSDLP leader Colum Eastwood and Sinn Fein\u0027s Michelle O\u0027Neill are both expected to travel to Dublin to see the pontiff. \n\nThe UUP and Alliance will be sending representatives.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sdlps mccrossan accuses sinn fein of rewriting civil rights campaigns history","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Do you think people are so foolish?\n\n\"SF know nothing about Civil Rights, never have! Ask Jean McConvilles family?\"\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, Mr McCrossan said Sinn Fein\u0027s actions at the time were \"the complete opposite\" of the civil rights movement.\n\nReacting to the comments, a Sinn Fein spokesperson said: \"Daniel McCrossan would have been welcome to attend today\u0027s march to stand up for rights and equality for all citizens.\n\n\"Unfortunately, he would rather spend his time constantly attacking Sinn Fein and trying to score cheap political points, as usual.\"\n\nAddressing the crowd at the event, former Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said the civil rights movement was \"never a republican conspiracy\" but was \"an instinctive and largely spontaneous response to decades of unionist misrule, abuse and sectarianism\".\n\nEarlier this year Sinn Fein\u0027s national chairperson Declan Kearney was criticised after saying the civil rights movements was influenced by the IRA and Sinn Fein leadership at the time.\n\nCivil rights campaigner and former MP Bernadette McAliskey, then-Bernadette Devlin at the time, has said his comments have no basis in fact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, she called for Stormont to be bulldozed at a conference marking the first march.\n\nAs a 21-year-old, the then-Bernadette Devlin was elected MP for Mid-Ulster in 1969, the youngest MP at the time. \n\nThe tough street campaigner rejected the abstentionism tactic to take her Westminster seat after fighting under the slogan: \"I will take my seat and fight for your rights.\"\n\nNow 71, she said: \"I run out of patience with that house on the hill. We deserve better and we should bulldoze the place.\"\n\nMs McAliskey also warned that racism and sectarianism were like rapidly spreading ragweed and that people do not understand racism in the way they do sectarianism.\n\n\"If you take your eye off them in any time or place or generation they will reassert themselves, every single day,\" she said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"temporary morgues planned for popes visit to ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"business parcels delivery sector investigated by uk watchdog","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

delivery sector investigated by UK watchdog\n\nBelfast\n\nThe communications watchdog has launched an investigation into the business parcel delivery sector over competition concerns.\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/news/uk/business-parcels-delivery-sector-investigated-by-uk-watchdog-37232786.html\n\nhttps://www.belfasttelegraph/news/uk/article37232787.ece/94334/AUTOCROP/h342/bpanews_75a5a368-0207-48b2-b8dd-4d9174e84142_1\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe communications watchdog has launched an investigation into the business parcel delivery sector over competition concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nOfcom said the probe would determine whether arrangements between companies was ultimately breaching EU law.\n\nIt said the investigation would look into “suspected market sharing and/or customer allocation arrangements between operators in the business parcel delivery sector in the UK and/or European Union.”\n\nThose arrangements will be scrutinised over whether they prevented, restricted or distorted competition in the UK or EU.\n\nA spokesman for Ofcom refused to outline which firms were being investigated.\n\nThe watchdog said the investigation was at an “early stage”, and stressed it had not yet concluded whether competition law had been breached.\n\nThe notice comes just one week after Ofcom fined Royal Mail £50 million.\n\nThe company was accused of abusing its dominant position by discriminating against its only major competitor for delivering letters, Whistl.\n\nThe penalty was the result of an investigation into a complaint lodged by Whistl, one of Royal Mail’s wholesale customers, following changes made to its wholesale customers’ contracts in 2014, including price increases.\n\nThe price rises meant that any of Royal Mail’s wholesale customers seeking to compete with it by delivering letters in some parts of the country, as Whistl was, would have to pay higher prices in the remaining areas – where it used Royal Mail for delivery.\n\nFollowing notification of these new prices, Whistl suspended plans to extend delivery services to new parts of the UK.\n\nRoyal Mail said last week that it plans to appeal against Ofcom’s decision, claiming its price changes were “never implemented or paid”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"chelsea clinton i might consider running for office but in the future","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

[]).push({})\n\n\nShe told the Edinburgh International Book Festival that while she “abhorred” Donald Trump’s presidency, she has no current plans to follow in her parents’ footsteps.\n\nShe strongly criticised the US leader on issues such as the separation of children from their parents at the Mexican border, branding the policy “the greatest sin of the moment”.\n\n“At federal level as much as I abhor so much of what President Trump is doing, I have a great amount of gratitude for what my congresswoman and my senators are doing to try to stop him at every point,” Ms Clinton said.\n\n\n\nI\u0027m outraged every day by something our president has done or said or left undone or neglected, or who he has recently bullied on Twitter or television\nChelsea Clinton\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“While I disagree with the President, other offices that I could run for I think my family … is being really well represented, but if that were to change, if my city councillor were to retire, if my congresswoman were to retire, my senators, and I thought that I could make a positive impact, then I think I would really have to ask my answer to that question.\n\n“For me it’s a definite no now but it’s a definite maybe in the future because who knows what the future is going to bring?”\n\nMs Clinton, who was promoting her children’s book on women who have persisted against adversity, was also asked about how her mother Hillary Clinton had handled the loss of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n“She just has continued to persist forward in trying to have a positive impact in politics and outside politics in the way that I have seen her do my entire life,” she said.\n\n“Of course it’s not the way I wish she would be doing that because I think she would’ve been a uniquely extraordinary president, but I’m not remotely surprised that she hasn’t pulled the covers over her head because that’s just not who my mom is.”\n\nShe added: “I’m outraged every day by something our president has done or said or left undone or neglected, or who he has recently bullied on Twitter or television.\n\n“For me, sometimes, I think I’m just so fundamentally my mother’s daughter that I’m far more outraged by the Trump administration ripping children away from their families at the border and not having reunified those children with their families now for months, than I am about anything he has ever done to my families.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChelsea Clinton was just 12 when her father became president (Paul Faith/PA)\n\n\n\n\nShe continued: “In some ways I think this is the greatest sin of the moment in our country and we very much are doing everything we can to stop this from happening.”\n\nMs Clinton, who was just 12 when her father Bill Clinton entered the White House, spoke of how critics made fun of her looks and referred to her as a dog.\n\n“I feel incredibly protective of Barron Trump, who is now 12 years old, the same age that I was,” she said.\n\n“I disagree with his father on everything but people have made fun of, bullied him, for his appearance, or for him being more private.\n\n“Equally I have no patience for that because he’s a child and he deserves a childhood as every child does.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"travellers urged to check vaccination status as european measles cases soar","story":"\n Hi

Do you have a son?”\n\nHugging the woman he’d last seen as a child, Mr Ri showed his mother a photo of her late husband, who had stayed behind in the North with him as a boy.\n\nThe week-long event is the first of its kind in nearly three years, and was arranged as part of diplomatic efforts to resolve a stand-off over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople had not seen their relatives since the 1950s (AP)\n\n\n\n\nMost of the participants in the reunions are in their 70s or older and are eager to see their loved ones once more before they die. \n\nMost have had no word on whether their relatives are still alive because they are not allowed to visit each other across the border or even exchange letters, phone calls or emails.\n\nAbout 90 elderly South Koreans, accompanied by their family members, will have three days of meetings with their North Korean relatives before returning to the South on Wednesday. A separate round of reunions from Friday to Sunday will involve more than 300 other South Koreans, according to Seoul’s unification ministry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move is part of increased reconciliation efforts (AP)\n\n\n\n\nDuring Monday’s meetings, many elderly Koreans held each other’s hands and wiped away tears while asking how their relatives had lived. They showed photos of family members who were not able to attend the meetings.\n\nHan Shin-ja, a 99-year-old South Korean woman, was at a loss for words after she reunited with her two North Korean daughters, both in their early 70s. \n\nNot knowing their separation would be permanent, she had left them behind in the North during the war while fleeing south with her third and youngest daughter.\n\nBefore this week’s reunions, nearly 20,000 people had participated in 20 rounds of face-to-face reunions since 2000.
