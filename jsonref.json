He appealed on the need to resist in resilience, with the threat of the climate crisis looming. “This is a blue-collar blueprint for how we restore America’s pride,” he said. “These are jobs that can’t be outsourced. We’re going to put plumbers and pipe-fitters back to work replacing lead pipes in America so families and children can drink clean water.  “We’re going to put line workers and electricians to work, laying thousands of miles of transmission lines and to build a modern infrastructure and energy grid.  “We’re going to make high-speed Internet affordable and available to everybody in America. “We’re going to make the largest investment in public transit in American history and we’re going to make the most important investment in our rail system since the creation of Amtrak 50 years ago.”He started off with some hard truths, basically negging the country by saying the US isn’t where it used to be in terms of global standing.  “For a long time, America set the pace across the entire globe. For the better part of the 20th century, we led the world by a significant margin in investments in ourselves, in our people, in our country,” Biden said.  “But then something happened. We slowed up. We stopped investing in ourselves.”  The US now ranks 13th in the world for infrastructure and 35th out of 37 major countries when it comes to investing in early childhood education, Biden said. “We took our foot off the gas,” he said.  That’s where the $1tn infrastructure bill and the $3.5tn reconciliation bill come into play. Donald Trump is facing increasing legal scrutiny in the crucial battleground state of Georgia over his attempt to sway the 2020 election there, and that heat is now overlapping with investigations in Congress looking at the former president’s efforts to subvert American democracy. A criminal investigation into Trump’s 2 January call prodding Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to “just find” 11,780 votes to block Joe Biden’s win in the state is making headway. The Georgia district attorney running the inquiry is also sharing information with the House committee investigating the 6 January attack on the Capitol in Washington. Meanwhile, a justice department taskforce investigating threats to election officials nationwide has launched inquiries in Georgia, where election officers and workers received death threats or warnings of violence, including some after Trump singled out one official publicly for not backing his baseless fraud claims. Despite these investigations, Trump is still pushing bogus fraud claims in Georgia.  Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is saying that there is “bipartisan outrage and support” over the issues raised by Haugen’s testimony and that for once, something may come of this.  “I have rarely ever seen the kind of unanimity on display today,” he said. “If you closed your eyes, without knowing who was talking, you wouldn’t know if it was a Republican or Democrat. You wouldn’t know what part of the country they were from. Because everywhere, red state, blue state, east and west, every part of the country has the harms that are inflicted by Facebook and Instagram.” So far, Blumenthal is correct. Legislators on both sides of the aisles are voicing their support of Haugen and talking about a need to hold the social media giant accountable.  Frances Haugen, a 37 former Facebook employee who came forward on Sunday to accuse the social media giant of putting profit over safety, testified before Congress today that Facebook knowingly harms children.  “Facebook knows that they are leading young users to anorexia content,” she said.  Facebook released a statement to Haugen’s testimony reading, “We don’t agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about.” Read more here:  This was the $3.5tn “human infrastructure” bill focusing on social services and environmental measures that was proposed after lengthy negotiations on the $1tn infrastructure bill seeking to improve roads, bridges, public transit and broadband.  Republicans and centrist Democrats like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have long balked at the size of the reconciliation bill, and the Biden administraion has acknowledged that they will have to make the package smaller. The Washington Post is reporting that Biden has proposed drastically scaling plans down to around $1.9tn to $2.2tn, while representative Pramila Jayapal, leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, is countering with $2.5tn to $2.9tn.Here’s Richard Luscombe, writing in May: Graham was speaking at the Summerville Country Club in Dorchester county. Video of his remarks was first published by the Daily Beast. “If you haven’t had the vaccine,” the 66-year-old said, “you ought to think about getting it because if you’re my age … “I didn’t tell you to get it,” Graham said. “You ought to think about it.” “No!” people yelled again. “False!” the crowd cried. “Not true!” The overwhelming majority of hospitalisations and deaths from the coronavirus in the US are among unvaccinated people. The US death toll recently passed 700,000. Graham has been vaccinated. Other Republican senators, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin prominent among them, have not, and continue to spread disinformation. In his widely covered (and ridiculed) remarks, Pence told Fox News last night he had made up with Trump over the riot and his own failure to overturn the election as Trump demanded.  Earlier today, the former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham told CNN she did not believe Trump and Pence ever had an honest conversation about 6 January. Grisham, who spoke to CNN for a rather torrid 40 minutes about her new, sensation-filled book about her time in service of Trump, also said Pence was not alone in being threatened at the Capitol on 6 January. Of the vice-president’s appeals for help, she said: “There were calls going to the White House saying, ‘My family is in danger, you know, what’s going on?’” Nonetheless, Pence is now firmly back behind Trump.  Here’s some further (must) reading, from February and by Sidney Blumenthal, a man who knows a thing or two about drama on Capitol Hill: Reminder that this comes as centrists like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have been aligning with Republicans in believing that the package was too large while progressives want it as is.  The Washington Post is now reporting from inside these closed meetings, hearing from their sources that Biden is proposing bringing the package down to $1.9tn to $2.2tn - well lower than the original $3.5tn plan.  Representative Pramila Jayapal, leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has countered with a minimum of $2.5tn, arguing that it would take up to $2.9tn to cover all the key programs proposed.  Manchin so far seems open to Biden’s proposed range.

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillTeachers’ unions say they support spreading assessment for the Leaving Cert across fifth and sixth year by placing a greater emphasis on project or practical work.The focus on high-stakes written Leaving Cert exams has been linked by many to mental health problems and anxiety among students.However, the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) told the Oireachtas education committee on Tuesday that it supports assessments in fifth year which would reduce the pressure on sixth years. This could mean students would have accumulated up to 60 per cent of overall marks across inidual subjects by the time they sit their end-of-school written exams.The  understands that this proposal is contained in a report on Leaving Cert reform being considered by Minister for Education Norma Foley.The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) report states that while there is broad agreement that exams should remain, it envisages giving greater weighting to continual assessment, projects or other course components over a two- or three-year periodTUI general secretary Michael Gillespie told the committee that senior cycle subjects were continually evolving and 22 of them now have second components, while some – such as PE – have three.“We have called for some second component assessments to take place during fifth year, thereby reducing the pressure in sixth year,” he said.However, he cautioned that changes should involve “evolution rather than revolution” and that teachers engaged with the assessment of their students over the past two years on a “without precedent” basis only.Undermine trustMr Gillespie also warned that any move towards continuous assessment overseen by teachers in the Leaving Cert could end up increasing stress for students, lead to over-assessment and undermine public trust.The Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland president Eamon Dennehy said the union has no issue with spacing out exams or assessments, as long as they are independently graded.“I want to be an advocate for my students,” he said. “I don’t want to be judge, jury and, if it comes to it, executioner.”The strengths of the current system included a high level of public trust provision of a valid and objective statement of students’ academic achievement fairness, impartiality and transparency.“What is deeply problematic is the fact that the Leaving Certificate examination is the sole pathway for school leavers to higher education,” he said.Secondary students told the committee that they do not want a return of the traditional Leaving Cert exam and a complete overhaul of the system is needed.OpportunityThe Irish Second-Level Students’ Union said disruption to exams due to the pandemic has resulted in a window of opportunity for “radical change “which better reflects candidates’ abilities.Emer Neville, the union’s president, said: “We can no longer continue to put plasters on a completely broken system. The solution is clear and that is a complete overhaul of the Leaving Certificate.”She said the union was seeking to space out exams over a longer period and introduce more erse assessments during fifth and sixth year.In addition, she said students should be able to gain points through extra-curricular achievements, while the number of university admission places through access routes and further education should be increased.“The goal should be to reduce the competition of the points race and to support students to have an equal opportunity to attend higher education,” Ms Neville said.Labour’s education spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin agreed that there was now a “once in a generation” opportunity to transform the Leaving Cert exam.“I’m haunted by the Leaving Cert I did in 1994 – and I’m 45 years of age ... I hear that it is trusted and transparent, but it has damaged so many people ... it is brutal and savage and puts far too much pressure on young people.”Sinn Féin’s education spokesman Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire agreed there was too much emphasis on the end-of-school exams and said the idea of allowing students to accumulate marks on a continuous basis during senior cycle should be explored."},{"url":null,"title":"rocky road ahead for government s plan to reduce emissions","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath and Minister for  Environment, Climate, Communications and Transport Eamon Ryan at the launch of the National Development Plan 2021-2040 at Páirc Uí Chaoimh, Cork on Monday. Photograph: Julien BehalIreland is facing into a decade when reducing reliance on the car and changing how homes are heated are necessary to wean the country off fossil fuels.Against this backdrop, the revised National Development Plan will facilitate big changes in how the economy operates, how the construction sector redirects itself – especially in housebuilding, and how people and goods move around.The plan includes new mechanisms for evaluating both carbon impact and pollution risk – by applying “environmental scoring” to projects. In effect, it acknowledges there is a carbon cost with all development which has to be delivered as sustainably as possible.But unresolved issues on competing priorities – building roads and tipping the balance in favour of public transport – persist, and there is a risk that ambitious climate commitments will soon become unrealisable.Separately, delivery within a reasonable time period remains the biggest issue around State-funded projects when the planning system is not fit for purpose and inadequately resourced. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath has incorporated elements to ensure better delivery backed by independent review.Big road projectsIf climate targets are to be met, much will depend on “what happens, when”, according to Friends of the Earth director Oisín Coghlan. Will BusConnects and cyclingwalking infrastructure, for example, come before big road projects?Transport is where emissions are rising fastest. Any wrong decision on transport infrastructure, Coghlan believes, could derail overall national climate targets, especially when there other huge challenges – in agriculture, and in power generation, where increasing electricity demand and weaknesses in grid infrastructure mean reliance on fossil fuels to fill gaps will continue longer than anticipated.Coghlan says meeting the decarbonising challenge has to mean using roads less often, regardless of whether those big road projects are proceeded with or not. That requires congestion charges, increased tolling and higher parking charges penalising urban drivers but not rural dwellers – “disincentives” that, arguably, should have been in place before workers return to workplaces post-Covid.Fundamentally, “we have not resolved the big choices we have to make. They have just confirmed terms of engagement,” says Coghlan. Major road projects are on the list alongside a requirement for 2:1 investment in favour of public transport including cyclingwalking options. There are many unanswered questions. Will 2:1 apply for the lifetime of this Government? How transparent will new climate impact assessments be? Producing them at the last minute as projects are announced, as was done previously, is unacceptable.Step changeHe suggests that the kind of step change needed is for a senior Minister to acknowledge that Ireland cannot proceed with a particular road project for climate reasons.For the construction sector, the stakes could not be higher. As Annette Hughes of EY Ireland flagged: “The NDP, the Housing for All Plan and the National Retrofitting Programme are entirely dependent on the industry being able to deliver.” It must significantly improve its productivity and change the way it works – while gearing up to ensure it has the skills base to do so.If that takes too long, public projects with potential to deliver the biggest emission cuts will inevitably be backloaded towards the end of the decade at best, so meeting the key commitment to halve emissions by 2030 becomes unlikely. Already, the absence of a timeline for completion of link, which would do a lot of heavy lifting on transport emissions, means it is downgraded and probably pushed into the 2030s.Minister for Climate and Transport Eamon Ryan insisted the plan is transformative, and placed great emphasis on interlinking elements. These included better compact development (15-minute cities, denser housing close to light rail and Dart lines), more balanced regional development and low-carbon development.This, he underlined, would be in an economy where renewable energy use is scaled up, with in excess of 80 per cent of renewables routinely accommodated on the grid. Rail for commuters in major urban areas and for freight distribution throughout the country would play its part. This needs to pursued without the prohibitive costs and lack-of-use problems of the past.The Green Party leader stressed “not every road project is guaranteed”. He is probably banking on discipline being imposed by the combination of upcoming carbon budgets and a revised national climate action plan – reinforced by legally binding targets and emission ceilings to ensure a 51 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. In short, that this will curtail carbon-intensive projects in the transport and construction sectors, and curtail road investment."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Julien Behal PhotographyThe Government’s National Development Plan “remains a wish list” without detailed timelines and costings, and has been likened to an “incoherent work of fiction” by the Opposition.The €165 billion plan was published on Monday, but the Coalition has faced criticism over a lack of specifics on some key projects, including the link scheme in Dublin’s norther commuter belt.“The plan lacks the detail in terms of costings, delivery times, priorities,” Social Democrats coleader Catherine Murphy said on Tuesday. “It remains a wish list until those pieces are in place,” the Kildare North TD said.She also said the Government had “lost its nerve” on the Dart Plus project despite spending €48 million on it so far.“Without costing those kinds of projects, how are we to know that the actual priority that’s give to public transport over roads will actually happen,” she said.Pointing out significant growth of the commuter belt in recent years – Fingal, Meath and Kildare had grown by between 39 and 41 per cent, she said – Ms Murphy said: “You can’t have that kind of housing development without the comparable public transport investment.”Ged Nash, the Labour finance spokesman, said the NDP was an “incoherent work of fiction”. He said it was “completely cynical” of the Government to publish the plan without “any kind of adequate costings outside of ceilings for capital expenditure in Government departments in the next 3-4 years”.`No timelines\u0027On link and Dart Plus, he said there are “no timelines for those particular initiatives and no project costings whatsoever”, and that it was an “absolute obligation of Government to provide at least indicative costings and timelines”.“Yesterday’s initiative contributes to the deep cynicism that already exists around politics,” he said.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said the NDP was “more pie in the sky from a government that continuously gives us plans, promises but delivers very little in the here and now on the major crises facing society.”At the launch of the plan, Mr Martin said that while a lot depends on a project’s journey through the planning and statutory process, the Government is committed to a large-scale capital investment over the coming 10 years.Speaking at Páirc Uí Chaoimh, Mr Martin also said that housing is the most urgent and important social issue facing the country right now and that 300,000 homes would be delivered by the end of 2030."},{"url":null,"title":"india s transport minister plans a more melodious traffic flow","story":"Traffic in New Delhi: incessant honking by vehicles is endemic across India, even at stop lights, as drivers weave their way through chaotic traffic along crowded highways.  Photograph:  Sonu MehtaHindustan Times via Getty Images India’s federal transport minister plans to institute nationwide legislation replacing raucous vehicle horns with those emitting melodious sounds of classical Indian musical instruments.“I am studying this ... and planning soon to make a law that all vehicle horns should produce pleasant sounds like those of the flute, tabla, violin, mouth organ and harmonium,” Nitin Gadkari said at a highway inauguration ceremony at Nashik, near Mumbai. He also said his ministry aimed to do away with “irritating” police and ambulance sirens and replace them with the “agreeable” signature tune relayed daily by the government-run All India Radio station. “I want to put an end to sirens and am thinking of substituting them with the tune composed for the radio station, so that people feel pleasant when ambulances or police patrol cars pass by,” Mr Gadkari said. Their sirens, he added, were also harmful to human ears. Incessant honking by vehicles is endemic across India, even at stop lights, as drivers weave their way through chaotic traffic along crowded highways or across congested and narrow pot-holed city and small town roads. Vehicle dealers say one of the first things potential customers in India check out before making a purchase is the loudness of the horn. “The horn is a critical part of any vehicle we sell ,” said Govind Rana, a popular jeep brand dealer in Chandigarh, 250km north of New Delhi. Many customers, he added, demanded more powerful and noisy air horns. Last year Mumbai police came up with a novel strategy to discipline unruly drivers who incessantly blew their horns at traffic lights even when they were red.They connected a decibel monitor to several city traffic signals which reset the red-stop light every time car and other horns exceeded 85 decibels, doubling the wait time. The message was simple: The more cars hooted, the longer they waited at traffic signals. And though this deterrent worked for a short period, traffic officials said honking levels had reverted in recent months to former cacophonous levels.

Sparta lived about 28,000 years ago and Boris 43,000 years ago. Photograph: Daniel McLaughlinBlasted from their permafrost graves by men hunting mammoth tusks, Sparta and Boris, two cave lion cubs who lived tens of thousands of years ago, are now cared for by scientists in the city of Yakutsk in eastern Siberia.They reside in the cold-storage room of a small building on a potholed backstreet of this hardscrabble city, as part of a unique menagerie of extraordinary Ice Age relics: a baby mammoth, a woolly rhino, the skulls of ancient bison and the still furry, still snarling head of a 32,000-year-old wolf.Animals whose remains long since rotted away in milder climes have been preserved in the permafrost of Russia’s north, but while the discoveries of recent years are a boon for scientists, they also highlight this remote region’s vulnerability to global warming and to man’s search here for many kinds of buried treasure.Boris and Sparta were unearthed deep in the interior of the Yakutia region, also called the Republic of Sakha, which is the biggest province on the planet. They were found in 2017 and 2018, just 15m apart, but scientists believe the male lived about 43,000 years ago and the female some 15,000 years later.Both cubs are thought to have been less than two months old when they died, probably in rock falls or cave collapses, which entombed them in permafrost that preserved them so well that experts managed to determine their sex, and expressed hopes that Sparta’s body may even still contain traces of her mother’s milk.They were discovered hundreds of kilometres northeast of Yakutsk beside a tributary of the remote Indigirka river, which flows north to the Arctic Ocean, at a place where the bones of ancient bears, wolves, horses, reindeer – and even an almost entirely intact, 46,000-year-old lark – have also been found.Boris takes his name from a local man who spotted him while hunting for mammoth tusks – known as “ice ivory”– which feed a Chinese market starved of banned elephant ivory and fuel dreams of sudden, life-changing wealth among people eking out an existence in Russia’s far north.“These things are always found by locals, not scientists – what can a dozen scientists do in a territory the size of India, that is inhabited by fewer than a million people?” says Albert Protopopov, head of the Ice Age fauna department at Yakutia’s Academy of Sciences.“I have good relations with lots of tusk hunters, and when they find something they call me and send photos. Just the other day I was told about a mammoth found near Tiksi on the Arctic coast. They say there is fur and flesh and fat on it, but I don’t know how much of the carcass remains,” he adds.“There is no other place like this in the world, where so many animals are found in such good condition. In some places, perhaps they make a big find once every 10 or 20 years – but here we find something really interesting every year.”Extraordinary conditionThe cave lion cubs – two of at least four that have been discovered in Yakutia – are among the best-preserved Ice Age creatures ever found. Their soft, sandy fur is still marked with darker patches, their ears are brown and the pads of their paws and their claws are intact.The wolf’s head still has reddish fur and formidable fangs, and a five-tonne, 39,000-year-old baby mammoth – nicknamed Yuka after members of the far-northern Yukagir community that unearthed her in 2010 – is the most complete member of her species yet discovered.Both Yuka and the wolf’s head contained remnants of their brains, and the extraordinary condition of finds made in Yakutia has allowed scientists to extract the world’s oldest DNA from a 1.2 million-year-old mammoth tooth, and for a state-run Siberian lab to start researching ancient viruses and virus evolution this year.Yet these long-extinct beasts, which grab world headlines when they re-emerge into the light, are of only passing interest to most of their discoverers.They want mammoth tusks, and go to considerable risk and expense to find them, hooking up engines to high-powered hoses to gouge deep holes in the permafrost, then venturing into these unstable tunnels in the hope of hauling out a bone weighing dozens of kilos, which could fetch tens of thousands of euro.Several people with knowledge of the trade said most “ice ivory” is sold by local tusk hunters to “agents” representing buyers from China, where mammoth bone meets huge demand created by a 2018 ban on the sale of elephant ivory.Experts believe more than 80 per cent of all the mammoth tusks in Russia lie buried in Yakutia, and estimate that more than 100 tonnes are unearthed legally each year by people holding licenses – but that the illegal trade may be twice as large, running to tens of millions of euro.As well as doing severe damage to permafrost – which is already melting due to global warming and emitting greenhouse gases as it thaws – the trade brings relatively small profits to most tusk hunters in Russia’s far north, while delivering much bigger sums to the agents and jewellery firms that sell finished carvings.In what officials call a bid to bring control and transparency to the trade, and to reduce permafrost damage, Yakutia this year banned the export of all mammoth tusks longer than three metres.Critics say the move will only fuel more smuggling, however, driving up criminality in the far north and making it even harder for many members of the region’s indigenous communities to make a living.Environmental damageRussia officially recognises the presence of about 40 indigenous peoples in Siberia and the country’s far north and the far east, who for centuries lived mostly from reindeer herding, fishing, hunting and other traditional practices.Soviet development of remote areas began to put pressure on these peoples and their way of life, but community leaders say the current push of Russia’s military and energy firms into the Arctic poses a bigger threat – especially at a time when climate change is also affecting pastures and animal migration routes.Boris Nikolayev, deputy president of the Evenk people of Yakutia, said the peoples of Arctic Russia “await with great interest and some concern” the new wave of development in the region, having witnessed the environmental damage caused by previous generations of incomers who lived far better than local people.“But after fulfilling their tasks and exhausting the natural resources ... these ‘neighbours’ abandoned everything they had built and moved elsewhere,” he told the Northern Forum on Sustainable Development in Yakutsk last week.“These so-called industrially developed places were almost completely lost to the traditional ways of life of the north, for centuries and perhaps forever. The bitter truth of history leads to fears ... of another round of this so-called development of Russia’s Arctic zone.”Avgusta Marfusalova, a long-time politician in Yakutia and advocate for the rights of its indigenous peoples, said herding, hunting and fishing were the “material basis on which the spiritual culture of the indigenous people of the north, Siberia and the far east developed”.TransparencyExperts warn that temperatures in the far north are rising twice as quickly as the global average, and Protopopov says plants are now flowering for considerably longer in the Russian Arctic, and mosquitoes have appeared for the first time in living memory on some of its islands.He explains that searching for mammoth tusks is now one of the main sources of income in remote parts of northern Russia, and should be regulated to help protect the environment, bring transparency to the industry and raise both the income of the tusk hunters and Yakutia’s tax take from the trade.Yet he opposes the ban on export of tusks longer than three metres, arguing that such finds are common, and that the move will drive the trade into the shadows.Protopopov and his colleagues fear hunters will cut up and smuggle tusks, depriving scientists of a chance to examine them before export and breaking the link between specialists and the local people who now alert them to less profitable finds – like the cave lion cubs – which amaze the scientific world and general public.“It’s a huge plus for us that they’re searching for mammoth tusks,” says Stanislav Kolesov, a researcher at Yakutia’s Academy of Sciences, which hopes to move its Ice Age animals to a planned World Centre of Mammoths in Yakutsk in about five years.“It is precisely as result of them them looking for tusks that we have these discoveries. We have a big collection because of their work, because of things they gave us.”“Let’s open up this market,” says Protopopov, “let’s have European and US auctions of mammoth tusks, so there’s no contraband, no danger of elephant ivory being traded as mammoth tusks, so the price goes up and everyone benefits.“I think people here should be allowed to gather tusks. It will be good for them, for the Republic of Sakha and for elephants,” he adds.“After all, it makes no difference to the mammoths – they died a long time ago. Now let them do some good by helping to save the elephants.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Fears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"boris cant defy laws political gravity forever","story":"The Conservative Party conference has shrunk. The auditorium here in Manchester more resembles a glorified fringe meeting because the main hall was deemed too cavernous to accommodate a smaller, Covid-affected, gathering without it looking half empty on TV, which is all that matters, of course. Boris Johnson will be afforded a larger setting when he speaks but his fellow ministers have been reduced to participating in somewhat desultory chats or set-piece addresses to a listless audience.It pains me to think that the first Conservative conference I attended was 40 years ago when the party leadership sat on a platform like the Soviet presidium looking down on the masses. If you think things are bad now you clearly don’t remember then. When the Tories gathered in Blackpool that year, the acrid smoke of the Brixton riots had only dissipated a few months before, IRA bombers were targeting London and other cities, manufacturing was contracting rapidly and unemployment was soaring.Labour was tearing itself apart – just the previous week in Brighton Tony Benn came within a whisker of becoming the deputy leader, an inconceivable triumph for the hard Left until Jeremy Corbyn, his acolyte, succeeded to the crown. In the opinion polls, the government and the opposition were being trounced by the new kid on the block, the SDP, which registered 50 per cent support at one point. It was a time of ferment and turmoil, a great clash of ideologies and big personalities.In Manchester today, it is as though the laws of political gravity have been suspended. Here we are at the end (we hope) of a period of rule by diktat, a pandemic that has killed thousands and led to record NHS waiting lists, no one able to travel easily, energy prices rising, fuel shortages, empty shelves and concerns that Christmas will be a miserable affair for a second year.Yet the Tories remain ahead in the opinion polls. Far from providing the bounce that usually goes with enhanced visibility, Labour’s conference has seen the party fall back. It is as though Sir Keir Starmer has sucked the life out of the Left, who find themselves in a parallel world where the Tories are attacking big business while Labour opposes tax rises for the NHS. Trots and union militants who would once have marched through the city shouting Boris Out and Tory scum are thin on the ground.The Tories can hardly believe their luck though whether it will last is another matter. Mr Johnson remains in irrepressibly bullish mood, sensibly declining invitations to acknowledge a crisis that does not exist, or at least not yet.His speech today will be a laurel-garlanded triumph, his entry to Rome after vanquishing the barbarians of socialism in 2019. But past glories are never enough preparing for the next election is now the priority and here Tories are less sanguine and somewhat uncertain.Are they still a small state, low tax party or pre-Thatcher interventionists in the mould of Harold Macmillan? Mr Johnson and his team have drunk the milk of dirigisme during the pandemic and have found it intoxicating. They have thrown an avuncular arm around the nation and are reluctant to release their grip. The tax burden is higher than at any time since the 1950s with no guarantee it will not rise further despite protestations from the Prime Minister and Chancellor that they remain visceral low taxers.In his speech on Monday, Rishi Sunak reasserted the importance of sound money and restoring credibility to the public finances shattered by the pandemic splurge. Yet there was little focus on the other side of the balance sheet, namely spending. Taxes are going up, but where are the cuts to help balance the books? We are told there is to be no return to austerity but paring back the public sector is not a hair-shirt endeavour but an essential requirement.Just 10 years ago this was an article of Tory faith. Before the 2010 election they were ardent supporters of a smaller state both as an end itself and as a necessity. The aggrandised public sector that ballooned under Labour was no longer affordable. As Liam Byrne, the outgoing Treasury chief secretary said in the notorious letter that he left behind on his desk for his successor, there was no money left.In opposition, reducing the size of government was a key Tory policy, a decisive break with a 50-year trend that had seen government become excessively intrusive, interfering and statist. They calculated, correctly, that the assumptions of the bureaucratic age – that the centre knows best – had been smashed by access to the internet. Now, people search out the cheapest or the best option in a matter of minutes. Yet when it comes to public services, not least the NHS, choices are not available.In opposition, the Conservatives were keen to pursue the approach adopted in Canada in the mid-1990s when their budget deficit spiralled out of control. It involved a comprehensive re-evaluation of what functions government should be undertaking and the jettisoning of anything non-essential. They reduced federal spending by almost 10 per cent in two years, leaving room for tax cuts which helped boost economic growth.Of course, the ambitions of the Tories were knocked back by the financial crash and the failure to win a majority in 2010, requiring a coalition with the Lib Dems. But the chance to rethink the state from the bottom up was lost and there is no sign it is being reconsidered.The outcome of the Chancellor’s spending review later this month will doubtless require some departments to cut their cloth but no one is expecting anything dramatic or fundamental. The biggest casualty so far appears to be Mr Johnson’s idea of building a tunnel to Ireland which was always daft.

It has served as a maxim to Chinese leaders to avoid abrupt, Cultural Revolution-style policy lurches that threaten to disrupt domestic cohesion. Under Xi Jinping, the quest for stability hasn’t changed - but the methods have.From rewriting the rules for China’s Big Tech firms, rapidly ending the two-child policy to cracking down on the freewheeling property market, Xi seems to have decided that now is the time for China to tackle some of its major challenges. Over the past 18 months, new policies to exert more state control over China have been coming thick and fast. At the same time, we have seen Chinese diplomats experiment with a much more confrontational tone abroad. From accusing a French researcher of being a “crazed hyena” to calling Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle “cowardly and despicable”, the emphasis has been less on making friends and more on showing off China’s newfound confidence. The immediate return of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor after the release of Huawei’s Meng Wanzhou was confirmation that Beijing conducted brazen hostage diplomacy.What has sparked this newly aggressive approach? Perhaps the most compelling argument is that 2022 is the year of the CCP’s 20th Party Congress. We will almost certainly see Xi elected to an unprecedented third term - and he will look to cement his legacy in the run-up to the big announcement. There is an argument that China’s leaders - buoyed by a confidence in its own political model and perceived decline of the West’s - sees a decade of opportunity where it can continue to transform its fortunes and achieve “national rejuvenation”. Last year, Xi declared that 2021 would mark the beginning of a “new development phase,” one that would privilege national security, “common prosperity” and social stability over unfettered growth. The government’s sweeping crackdowns are consistent with that vision.This matters for Britain because we live in the era of Global China. International investors’ nervousness over the collapse of Evergrande, triggered by a crackdown on China’s freewheeling property market, reminds us of the risk of financial contagion. When China’s leaders demonstrate their willingness to unleash nationalist fervour, it risks being unleashed on Western firms, such as the backlash against H\u0026ampM in China over a statement it made on Xinjiang. China’s leaders\u0027 increasing tolerance for risk partly explains why their armed forces have sent 150 planes into Taiwan’s airspace in four days.The past 18 months has told us a huge amount about Xi’s vision for China and its place in the world order. The signs suggest a period of deeper instability where the values ergence between the CCP and Britain is likely to grow. Any China strategy will have to involve a blend of improving domestic resilience and strengthening international alliances. While AUKUS and accession to the CPTPP represents a start, building new alliances in the Indo-Pacific requires trust-building that may take a generation. The good news is that, at home, we have the option of moving much faster. There are many levers that we can pull now to readjust our approach to China in the UK and reduce strategic dependence.Take our biggest single services export to China: universities. Financial dependence is only deepening. The number of Chinese students enrolling in British universities this year was the highest on record, at the same time as the number of students from the EU fell drastically. While overseas students and international cooperation are essential in higher education, we find ourselves in a situation where some of our leading universities are relying on China for over one-fifth of fee income. We need to help universities pursue more ersified revenue models. Next, despite the Government’s decision to remove Huawei from 5G networks on national security grounds over a year ago, the UK’s overall approach to Chinese technology in our critical infrastructure is still unclear. We know that Beijing directs investment into strategic technologies with an eye on geopolitics. Yet the Government initially waved through a Chinese firm’s takeover of the UK’s largest semiconductor factory, Newport Wafer Fab. It eventually backtracked and ordered a national security review, but it remains unresolved three months later. We’re still waiting to hear whether Chinese energy giant CGN will be building nuclear power stations in the UK. In the industries of the future, it’s not clear that we’re thinking very much about dependency either. The UK announced a new £1bn battery gigafactory in Sunderland - with significant government support - to be built in partnership with Chinese firm, Envision AESC. Chinese firms dominate the battery industry, aided by a decade of state subsidies. COP26 will see us double down on electric vehicles. We need a strategy for reducing dependence on China in the manufacturing process.And local councils are still spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on CCTV cameras made by Hikvision and Dahuatwo firms which have strong links to Xinjiang’s surveillance state. Both are still on the list of the Surveillance Camera Commissioner’s approved providers we should be providing much stronger guidance for local councils which factors in human rights.There is so much more we can do to join up the dots between national security, values, trade, diplomacy, and geopolitics.Julia Pamilih is Director of Research at the China Research GroupMore from NewsBoris can’t defy the laws of political gravity foreverTurn to family first – not the state – for social care support, says Sajid JavidMinister promises annual mental health ‘MOT’ for all Armed ForcesEthnic minority charity welcomes return of blackface Morris dancersNew league tables will expose police forces that fail rape victimsPriti Patel launches inquiry into how ‘monster’ Wayne Couzens was able to work as police officerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"colonial roots london sightseeing guide labels exotic plants","story":"Wisteria has colonial roots, according to a sightseeing guide funded by Transport for London which has branded botanical terms “native” and “invasive” as offensive.Classifying plants as “exotic” also has “colonial connotations” as it symbolises the “mysteriously foreign”, the authors of the map claim.The \u0027Art on the Underground\u0027 pamphlet guides visitors through green spaces in Brixton, south London, pointing out the “colonial roots of plants in our parks, gardens and squares today”, and that acts of colonialism “still affect who owns a garden today and who doesn’t”.Wisteria is highlighted among the potentially problematic plants because it was “brought to England in 1812 by John Reeve, an East India Company tea inspector”.The East India Company “had its own armies to conquer and control territories in South and East Asia and plant collectors used East India Company ships and networks”. In its overview of parks and gardens, the Brixton Botanical map also claims: “Many of London’s plants were imported as seeds by naturalists who were engaged in colonial activity of all kinds, from plantation and slave-ownership to East India Company business.”The guide highlights the fact that the London plane tree is descended from an Oriental Plane, a “derogatory’ term which is used  to “describe people or objects from or characteristics of Asia”.Local green space Myatt\u0027s Fields Park, named for 19th-century rhubarb producer Joseph Myatt, has also been highlighted, as the farmer’s trade in the pudding ingredient grew with the importing of sugar, which was produced by slaves.The guide also states that “the use of colonial terminologies to describe ‘exotic’ plants is ongoing. Many common plant names reflected racist slurs”.Some examples may include the kaffir lime, with “kaffir” an offensive term for black Africans with its origins in the Arabic word for non-believer.The succulent Crassula marnieriana could also be seen as offensive, as it is sometimes known as “hottentot”, an antiquated term for the southern African Khoekhoe people.Breadfruit, which the map points out is sold on Brixton’s markets, has been highlighted for its links to slavery, as it was cultivated to feed slaves on plantations.Dr Zareer Masani, a historian of Britain’s colonial past, has decried the finding of offense in Britain’s botany. He said: “The fact that the current craze to blame colonialism or slavery for almost everything has now reached our plants is a measure of how absurd things have become.“Organisations like TFL need to get a grip and focus on the services they’re meant to provide. “The obsession with this kind of political correctness has travelled from our statues and road names to the very food we eat, the clothes we wear, the language we use and now the flowers we enjoy.  “One can only guess which new area of our lives is left for our new Puritans to attack next.More from NewsBoris can’t defy the laws of political gravity foreverTurn to family first – not the state – for social care support, says Sajid JavidMinister promises annual mental health ‘MOT’ for all Armed ForcesEthnic minority charity welcomes return of blackface Morris dancersNew league tables will expose police forces that fail rape victimsPriti Patel launches inquiry into how ‘monster’ Wayne Couzens was able to work as police officerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ethnic minority charity welcomes return blackface morris dancers","story":"An ethnic minority charity has welcomed the return of a Morris dancing group who defended the use of blackface during performances.Morris dancers have been wearing blackface as far back as the 15th century but came under criticism last year after the death of George Floyd sparked a wide-ranging discussion of racism and prejudice.A wave of Black Lives Matter protests prompted the Joint Morris Organisation (JMO) in July 2020 to ban the practice among its 800 members as it has the “deep potential to cause hurt”.This saw the Britannia Coconut Dancers (also known as the Coconutters) based in Bacup, Lancashire, split from the JMO over their refusal to stop using blackface make-up. The group commented at the time that “removing any part of our costume will take away the mystique of who we are”.Last weekend, the Coconutters had been asked to perform at the Bacup Makers Market, but the performance was cancelled after some residents threatened to boycott the market entirely. The group rebelled against this decision by staging a five-hour dance through Bacup in their “full traditional outfit”.The Coconutters claimed they had received “exceptional” support from the townspeople and local businesses. It was the first time the group had performed publicly since the blackface ban.And Lancashire BME Network, a charity which highlights the plight of ethnic minorities within the region, said they had no objections to the performance as it is a “rich cultural tradition”.The charity said the use of blackface within this context was not racist as the practice historically related to underpaid mill workers “who painted their face black so their employers would not know that they were dancing for extra money”.Jonathon Prasad, project officer for Lancashire BME network, said they were “supportive” of the group as they have never viewed it as a racial issue.He told the Lancashire : “In the past when I’ve worked on similar topics, I’ve never seen them as a racial thing at all.“We believe that communities should be going out and really asking questions about why people do blackface.“If it was a minstrel type of show, that’s a different sort of context and we might have a different opinion.”Gavin McNulty, secretary of the Britannia Coconut Dancers, defended the performance saying “they were continuing a tradition which has been upheld for over 200 to 300 years.”Mr McNulty confirmed the group had darkened their faces during the performance in “keeping with our tradition which is respected worldwide.”He told the Daily : “This is the way it should be and this is the way that we as a team, in our community want it, hence all the controversy of the past couple of years.“We danced out on Sunday 3rd October through the town of Bacup and the support from the townsfolk was exceptional and thanks to Facebook we had people watching from all over the world such as Australia and the Netherlands, even America, so this shows the support the team has.”The true origins of the use of blackface within Morris dancing remains hotly debated.British folklore expert Professor Ronald Hutton told the  last year that while the Morris name is derived from the Moors, the use of black make-up predated racial connotations and was widespread in folk plays.In June 2020, the JMO had said that blackening faces is a dwindling practice among dancing teams, and “will be banned to make the folk tradition fully inclusive of all races and backgrounds without performers or spectators feeling uncomfortable.”The organisation is also moving to prevent the tradition being exploited for nationalist symbolism by far-right groups.More from NewsBoris can’t defy the laws of political gravity foreverTurn to family first – not the state – for social care support, says Sajid JavidMinister promises annual mental health ‘MOT’ for all Armed ForcesNew league tables will expose police forces that fail rape victimsPriti Patel launches inquiry into how ‘monster’ Wayne Couzens was able to work as police officerGovernment cannot \u0026#39patch and mend\u0026#39 every supply-chain issue, says Boris JohnsonMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labour siding insulate britain instead ordinary working people","story":"Conservative MPs and ministers haven’t been slow to condemn the tactics of Insulate Britain, whose campaign to make life as difficult as possible for Britain’s drivers continues apace.But where is Labour in all of this?Were I to compile a list of groups who might naturally and traditionally be considered to be those that Labour is instinctively inclined to defend and stand up for, those seeking to earn a living by driving through a congested city during the day would be near the top. When activists blocked Wandsworth Bridge yesterday morning, angry drivers were filmed doing what the police should have done much earlier: dragging entitled and self-absorbed middle class protesters out of the way. One of the causes of their frustration was that among the hundreds of vehicles forced to grind to a halt was at least one ambulance.NHS workers, delivery vans, school run parents – no one drives through that part of London on a weekday morning for pleasure these were all people with jobs to do and with places they needed to be. And yet Labour MPs said nothing in their defence. If they were angry on behalf of those whose jobs and lives were disrupted, they were keeping quiet about it.Why? The obvious conclusion presents itself: they are frightened (and the word is entirely appropriate) of upsetting the environmental lobby, including many of their own activists.This makes no sense on an electoral level, but on a moral level it is unforgivable.First of all, the electoral. Hardly a day goes by without an analysis being published somewhere of the difficulty Keir Starmer faces in his bid to win the next general election, particularly the task facing him in the so-called Red Wall seats, where traditional working class Labour voters abandoned the party for the Conservatives at the last election.It was an issue that was threatening to rear its head years earlier, when Emily Thornberry posted a tweet mocking St George’s flags and white van owners. And there were no doubt a few white vans held up on Wandsworth Bridge yesterday and perhaps even a few of their drivers helped to clear the road to allow traffic to pass – in itself a community spirited act aimed at helping other road users as much as themselves.Shouldn’t those workers, whether in the north of England or in London, have expected the Labour Party to come to their defence, to decry these protesters for their selfish actions? Does Labour seriously think that holding on to the green vote will help them win back Red Wall seats in Birmingham? Or is it simply that they value, and are more sympathetic to, the kind of voter represented by Insulate Britain activists than to ordinary working class voters who are most impacted by the protests and traffic jams?Unsurprisingly, Insulate Britain’s stoutest defender, George Monbiot, appeared on the radio bulletins yesterday to defend its right to make everyone’s lives a misery on the basis that (in his opinion) their priorities are the correct ones. Setting aside the utter foolishness and historical illiteracy of his comparing these protests with the struggle of the American civil rights movement in the 1950s and ’60s, this is a man who, in 2007, wrote in gleeful anticipation of an economic recession that, while ruining the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, would reduce carbon emissions and was therefore to be welcomed.A more appropriate epitome of metropolitan disdain for the struggle of working class people to earn a living could hardly be imagined. And yet no one in the Labour Party took to the airwaves or social media to call out Monbiot or his tarmac-bothering compatriots. By their inaction they have allowed the Conservative Party to become, by default, the champion of working people. There is no point in referring to the history books and repeating the (now rather pointless) mantra that Labour was created by the trade unions to represent working people: voters will judge today’s politicians by their words and their actions, not by their heritage.Just as there are good electoral reasons for condemning Insulate Britain, the moral reasons for defending them are at best dubious. A decade ago the anti-austerity group UK Uncut decided that the best way to force retail boss Philip Green to pay more tax was to make life difficult for shoppers in the run-up to Christmas. As in 2021, those who relished the misery they caused to people desperately trying to buy gifts for their families believed their own cause was so pure that they had the moral authority to do what they liked. I was one of the few Labour MPs at the time to condemn their spoiled brat behaviour and received a fair amount of abuse in return. Is that what today’s horny-handed sons (and daughters) of toil in the Parliamentary Labour Party are afraid of? A few ill-tempered tweets? If losing a few Twitter followers is a price too high for Labour MPs to pay for standing up for the rights of working people to go about their business unencumbered by virtue-signalling eco-warriors, I really doubt if they would ever be willing to make the changes that are necessary to see their party become the natural choice once more of Britain’s working class voters.More from NewsBoris can’t defy the laws of political gravity foreverTurn to family first – not the state – for social care support, says Sajid JavidMinister promises annual mental health ‘MOT’ for all Armed ForcesEthnic minority charity welcomes return of blackface Morris dancersNew league tables will expose police forces that fail rape victimsPriti Patel launches inquiry into how ‘monster’ Wayne Couzens was able to work as police officerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy submarine jousts japanese show strength aimed china","story":"A Royal Navy submarine has taken on the Japanese navy in the first training exercise of its kind in a show of strength to China.The exercise last month involved “thousands of tons of steel in a game of cat and mouse” a former Royal Navy anti-submarine frigate captain told the .The Japanese navy said it had conducted “a bilateral exercise with the Royal Navy in order to strengthen cooperation and realise a free and open Indo-Pacific”.The exercise took place on Sept 14 and 15, the Japanese navy said.The deepening defence relationship between Britain and Japan and the forging of new friendships in the region is likely to anger China.Taking place in waters off Japan, the drills were part of the ongoing deployment of the UK Carrier Strike Group, based around HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s newest operational aircraft carrier.The Royal Navy’s nuclear-powered Astute-class submarine would likely have gone up against a Soryu-class diesel-electric boat from the Japanese navy.Tom Sharpe, a former commander in the Royal Navy and an anti-submarine warfare specialist, said the interaction demonstrated the “width of soft and hard power options a carrier strike group brings to the table”.“This is a strategically vital part of the world, with the Chinese army and Air Force currently and repeatedly encroaching Taiwanese airspace.“This is the sort of exercise that strengthens everything from strategic alliances to tactical operating procedures.“VIP visits, group formations and freedom of navigation operations photograph well and tend to capture the headlines.“Meanwhile, underwater, far from any cameras, thousands of tons of steel are engaged in a game of cat and mouse, the implications of which will resonate from the very highest levels of political alliance-forming to the operators in the respective submarine control rooms.”Diesel-electric submarines are often quieter than nuclear powered boats when submerged, due to the noise generated by the primary coolant pumps around the reactor.Even so, nuclear submarines are more highly prized as they can operate for longer, deeper and at greater ranges than diesel-electric boats.Taro Kono, the leading candidate to succeed Yoshihide Suga, Japan’s outgoing prime minister, has expressed support for transitioning Japan’s 20-strong submarine force to nuclear powered vessels, given the increasing threat from China.These drills are likely to have emboldened calls for Japan’s submarines to adopt nuclear power and come just weeks after Australia agreed to develop such a fleet with Britain and the US.The exercise would have been tightly controlled to prevent an inadvertent collision underwater.The British and Japanese boats would likely have taken it in turns to be the hunter force. Each would have operated in an area of roughly 20 square miles, with the boxes separated laterally by at least a mile.Without surface ships present, the submarines will have practised search and attack phases. If warships were involved, it is likely one submarine would have been assigned to the surface group and the other would act as the aggressor, trying to get a clean shot on the group’s mission critical ship.Mr Sharpe said the ultra quiet submarines would have been “holes in the ocean” throughout the exercise, as each tried to get a firing solution on the other.The key vulnerability of diesel-electric submarines is the necessity to come to periscope depth periodically, to “snort” fresh air whilst running the diesel engines to recharge the batteries. It is not known if the Japanese boat had to conduct this procedure.The British hunter-killer submarine would have been able to remain submerged throughout the exercise.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “Japan is one of our closest strategic partners.

Boris Johnson? An unironed navy sock filled with sausage meat, nipped and loosely tucked to create limbs, with some Chipsticks glued to the top as a hairstyle. Pull the string on his back and he could conjure nine different authentic blathering sounds. Michael Gove? Just take the original Parker puppet from Thunderbirds, treble the size of the lips, pop some little spectacles on, and hope it doesn’t scare children when it dances. Priti Patel? Smiling-scowling, and wearing a tiny version of that personalised National Crime Agency jacket she wore while rubbernecking on some immigration raids in May. But when it comes to Rishi Sunak, what does that doll look like? When you think of our diminutive Chancellor, more than half a dozen different characters could spring to mind. Yesterday, we saw him suited and booted and energetic and telling us the future is HERE and it’s TIME to seize it at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester. Before that he was clad in traffic cone orange, helping Boris Johnson to point at things on a Manchester construction site. The day before that he was in his hoodie, being the chilled out wealthy tech bro he frequently projects. There are, at a conservative estimate, at least seven sides to Sunak. He is the heptahedron of British politics. The chameleon of the Cabinet. The real Rishi may never stand up, but let us count his ways, in order of how frequently we see them. Like swallowing spiders in our sleep, we probably don’t even realise how often we see Rishi Sunak’s signature every week. Hundreds, possibly. It’s there on almost every social media post from either his personal account or that of the Treasury, on official literature, on slides, in adverts and at media briefings. And that’s notwithstanding how often it haunts our dreams. Brand Sunak – which kick-started during the pandemic, when the Chancellor’s autograph started appearing on fiscal pledges like he’s Eric Bristow personally endorsing a dartboard – is the most relentless online campaign since Cadbury released the Orange Twirl. And just like that piece of confectionary, Sunak in theory is far more appetising than Sunak in practice. It’s easy to forget, when you read the column inches (sorry) he commands, see the way he presents himself, hear him speak, or regard the way Boris Johnson looks in comparison – but Rishi Sunak is not in fact the Prime Minister. He’s not even the Deputy Prime Minister – that title was used recently as a dummy to soothe an incessantly wailing Dominic Raab. No, Sunak’s at best third in command, a role he occasionally has to fill by standing next to Boris Johnson in Parliament, on walkabouts and at lecterns.Many people of the Chancellor’s ambition would find it galling to have to meekly nod while their boss takes the limelight, but remember that this man’s boss is somebody who only has to be near a room to make everybody else in it seem shevelled and tactful. So Sunak is unlikely to mind.“Whaddup guys! Gah, feels so good to be out of that suit jacket and tie – so stiff, so formal, so not my vibe, but The Man makes me wear a suit so I’ve gotta play the game in order to change the score, amiright? No, I’m much more comfortable in this, a very thin £46 grey hoodie from Everlane, which I wear whenever I am eager to transmit what my advisors dub Silicon Valleycat Energy. “I wear my thin grey hoodie about as much as Rocky Balboa wears his. It’s the sartorial equivalent of spinning a chair around and straddling it backwards, they say. It’s the perfect contrast to Boris, who literally goes running in a collared dress shirt, they say. It’s me.”“How does he look so trim and fresh?” people asked of Sunak last year, when he appeared looking lithe and pristine at every Covid press conference, while Chris Whitty wore the signs of running on 30 minutes’ sleep, and Boris Johnson looked like Boris Johnson. The answer came when Sunak admitted that he owns a Peloton, a type of very expensive exercise bike which seems to come with a stipulation that all users must tell everyone they know that they are converts, like Mormonism or polyamory. Sunak is up at 6am to cycle, he has told us, and his favourite Peloton instructor is a 33-year-old New Yorker called Cody Rigsby. “You do have to listen to a lot of Britney,” Sunak said. “But you know, no bad thing in trying to get you motivated, I guess.” He then has a Greek yoghurt, or a Mexican Coke, or just a bit of chicken broth, if he’s intermittently fasting. The actual day job. The navy suit might be designer and tailored to his body, but it’s still the uniform of a working politician, and that’s certainly one of Sunak’s many personas. Sometimes – not as often as we’d like, but sometimes – he just gets on with the job of government, and presents that way to the public: as a person with a responsible job who is doing it diligently and well. Occasionally, Sunak reminds us that he is a former banker and hedge fund manager whose wife, Akshata, is said to be wealthier than the Queen, and herself the daughter of N.R. Narayana Murthy, one of the wealthiest men in India. Designer suits, fur-lined jackets that somehow emanate wealth, a general air of money… In some ways it makes sense to put in charge of the country’s GDP one of the few people to be used to dealing with that amount of zeros just when they open their joint account, but Sunak, a fairly private man when it comes to his family, tries to play that down. He can’t hide it, though.The side we’ll see more and more.

Boris Johnsonaposs special envoy to Afghanistan, Sir Simon Gass, sat down with the group to discuss the humanitarian crisis facing the country. The top diplomat also told them they had a duty to make sure the nation did not once again descend into a haven for terrorists. Foreign Office officials said Sir Simon stressed the need for continued safe passage for Afghans who had helped the British mission who wanted to leave. And he raised the treatment of women and girls after the Taliban effectively banned girls from secondary education by ordering high schools to re-open only for boys.  The talks are a signicant development as they suggest that UK efforts to help thousands more people leave the country remain a priority. The Taliban has been in control since the fall of the western-backed government in August, which followed the chaotic withdrawal of US and UK troops. Britain does not intend to recognise the Taliban as the government of Afghanistan any time in the near future. But ex-foreign secretary Dominic Raab announced earlier this month that the UK would start engaging directly with the Islamist group.  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace warned that the military withdrawal from Afghanistan had created opportunities for both China and Islamist terrorists. He told a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester: Who popped up immediately as the US and Nato were leaving, but China, offering to invest in Afghanistan  That was about securing land routes to ports such as Karachi and also into Pakistan. He added: It is all connected. The ripples from Afghanistan will be felt by al-Shabaab in Somalia, and of course al-Shabaab pose a threat to British interests and to our friends in Kenya. The ripples of another superpower being portrayed as defeated by Islamic terrorism will be felt across the world.   The PMaposs envoy Sir Simon met Taliban leaders including Amir Khan Muttaqi, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Abdul Salam Hanafi.

The facts of the case were not exactly as Mr Raab suggested in his speech.And it came almost ten years to the day after Theresa May sparked fury by ly claiming a man had been protected from deportation because he had a cat.In fact, Mrs May even mentioned the man seized upon by Mr Raab today in her speech in . The newly minted Justice Secretary used his speech to Conservative Party Conference to complain that laws were being abused by dangerous criminals. And he claimed a drug dealer convicted of beating his ex-partner, a man who hadnapost paid maintenance for his daughter, then successfully claimed the right to family le to avoid deportation.  The criminal in question was Trinidadian-born Asim Parris. Then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith had originally ordered Parrisapos deportation in  after he had been jailed for  months for possession of cocaine with intent to supply. A year earlier, he had been convicted of battery against his partner and given a suspended sentence. But his argument to be prevented from deportation was not based on his former partner or daughter, but on his being  years old and having lived in the UK since he was four. He appealed and in  the Immigration Tribunal allowed him to stay, noting he had close family in this country including his mother, sisters, brother, cousin, nieces and nephews, uncle and aunt.  And at the original appeal, his former partner told the tribunal that while they were no longer in a relationship he was a good and caring father and the judges said she and Parris appear[ed] to be on good terms. The Home Office appealed the ruling, but the Court of Appeal eventually ruled the original judgement that he should be allowed to stay in the UK was upheld. The three judges hearing the case at the Court of Appeal made no findings about the tribunalaposs assessment of the facts, and only examined whether it had applied the correct law - a position that the Home Officeaposs own lawyer agreed with.  Mr Raab said in his speech: It is absolutely perverse that someone guilty of domestic abuse could claim the right to family le to trump the publicaposs interest in deporting him from this country, he added. Weaposve got to bring this nonsense to an end. Ten years ago yesterday, Theresa May faced fury over a  claim about a criminal being protected from deportation because he had a pet cat. Then Home Secretary, Mrs May said in a Tory conference speech: We all know the stories... about the illegal immigrant who cannot be deported because, and I am not making this up, he had a pet cat. Within minutes of the speech, the Judicial Office at the Royal Courts of Justice had pointed out that it was untrue, and that the cat had nothing to do with the decision. Mrs May also mentioned the case of Mr Parris in her speech, saying: A man who hadnapost paid maintenance for his daughter. Then successfully claimed the right to family le to avoid deportation.

Oliver Dowden bizarrely suggested civil servants were widespread owners of the high-end exercise bike, which costs £, plus a £-a-month subscription. He also made the claim just weeks after his own government unveiled plans to let workers request flexible working - including home working - from Day One in a job. Mr Dowden told aconference fringe event: People really want the Government to lead by example, they want civil servants to get back to work. We have got to start leading by example on that. He added: People need to get off their Pelotons and get back to their desks. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is among the lucky Brits rich enough to own a Peloton.  But the comment appears to be a jibe at the most senior civil servant in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, where Mr Dowden was until recently the top minister. Permanent Secretary Sarah Healey reportedly told a tech conference she liked working from home, because “I have a Peloton and I can just get on my bike whenever I have a teeny bit of time. “That has been a huge benefit to my well-being, the lack of travelling time eating into my day.” Mr Dowden also claimed billionaires who donate £, and get dinners with the Prime Minister do so out of “civic duty”. Labour chair Anneliese Dodds said: Oliver Dowden thinks people are sitting at home on Pelotonsinstead of working.And that billionaires are donating hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Conservative Party out of a sense of civic duty.

Mr Elliot was doorstepped by Sky News at the event in Manchester, where he was repeatedly grilled over allegations he had organised meetings between businessmen and the future king. The -year-old is the Duchess of Cornwall’s nephew and a director of Quintessentially - a “luxury lestyle management service” for the super-rich. He was dragged into a row when Quintessentially subscriber and Tory donor Mohamed Amersi claimed in July that Mr Elliot arranged for him to meet Prince Charles - after years of subscription payments. The Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists found Mr Elliot did not need to register as a lobbyist but had advised him to be cautious about making a distinction between his Quintessentially role and his activities linked to the Government.  Asked repeatedlyhe was offering access to his uncle Prince Charles for money, Mr Elliot remained tight-lipped. He also didnapost answer questions about whether there was a conflict of interest between his work and his role at the Tory party. He told Sky News reporter Joe Pike: Iaposm going to have a curry nowthataposs ok, before adding: I wish youaposd stop following me. Mr Amersi claimed at the time: “I call it access capitalism… You get access, you get invitations, you get privileged relationshipsyou are part of the set-up, and where you are financially making a contribution to be a part of that set up. The Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists found Mr Elliot did not need to register as a lobbyist, but it advised him “to be cautious about the possibility of engaging in consultant lobbying activityby not making a clear enough distinction between his role as a director of Quintessentially and his other activities connected to government.” A spokesperson on behalf of Mr Elliot said at the time: “The registrar has made clear that Quintessentially does not lobby Government and therefore does not need to register as a lobbyist.” Tory chairman Oliver Dowden launched a furious defence of Mr Elliot, branding him “fantastic”. He told a fringe event hosted by The : “Ben is a fantastic man and one of the great fundraisers of the Conservative Party. “He was the person who powered the election victory in  - he’s broadened our base of supporters and brings a great deal of expertise. “We’re getting along great”. Mr Dowden dismissed press questions about Mr Elliot’s financial arrangements, claiming “I have seen this every single time” with other fundraisers. He added: “I don’t believe Ben Elliot has done anything wrong, he’s properly separated his interests and so on.” It comes as Mr Amersi, who has given more than £, to the Conservatives since , was linked to a major corruption scandal. The so-called Pandora Papers documents reveal the -year-old corporate lawyer advised on a series of deals for a Swedish telecoms company, according to the BBC. The firm, Telia, later accepted the mdeal was a corrupt payment - a bribe for the daughter of the then-president of Uzbekistan.

Tory MP Nigel Mills, who sits on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, told a conference fringe event in Manchester: “I think the government are being a little bit foolish I think politically and they’re being unfair on people by taking that away.  “I sense by the end of October the government may have realised that probably wasn’t the…having spent months wanting the government to stand up and not back down every time something got dficult, I think they’ve picked the wrong issue to start with. “No doubt we will see in a few weeks with the rising cost of living how bad a decision that is.” Mr Mills slammed the new Household Support Fund, sayingministers had £m to spend on “creating very complicated funds” people have to apply for, spending money on the benefit itself would be a better use of money. Speaking to the Bright Blue fringe, Mr Mills said unlike a decade ago, “I don’t think there’s the same political concern that welfare’s too high and it’s too easy. I think we should be very careful we’re not playing the politics of a decade ago when there was a problem to fix. Now there actually isn’t one. Read more “And we actually may end up going so far that we look cruel and harsh and leaving people in an impossible situation that no one wants to see - everybody has grandchildren or friends who will end up in this situation.” Tory MP Peter Aldous said it was “wrong” to be taking away the £-a-week now when Britain had just seen its worst economic shock in a century. He warned costs are “cascading in” on families, telling the fringe event: “The idea we just switch on the light and go back to normal is not going to happen. “Covid is going to have a very long tail and we’ve seen that in the last  days with the crisis in the energy sector, there are challenges with regard to food, housing costs and rents.” Mr Aldous said many claimants are “not in a position now” to take up vacancies. He added: “It’s probably not consistent with the levelling up agenda. The levelling up agenda has a lot of focus quite rightly on infrastructure.  “But actually equipping and providing people with the skills to take up those jobs, and as Conservatives provide a fair benefits system, a safety net that provides you with some degree of security…. I think we have made a mistake.” Boris Johnson earlier defended the £-a-week cut to Universal Credit that will plunge hundreds of thousands of families into poverty. The Prime Minister argued that businesses should put up wages rather than taxpayers subsidising them through the welfare system. But low-income families face the triple whammy of rising prices and energy bills along with falling income support this winter. In a round of broadcast interviews, Mr Johnson said: I understand that people feel times are dficult at the moment because we have got an economy thataposs coming out of a very tough period with the Covid pandemic. He added: What we wonapost do is take more money in tax to subsidise low pay through the welfare system.The Government has been in an escalating row with Labour, unions, landlords, debt charities and Tory MPs, including former welfare secretaries, who want it to cancel the cut.But ministers claim the plan is the “right way to help people” by focusing on those in work, even though % of claimants already have a job.

Flo Sandler, , and her photographer husband, Oli Sandler, , from Medway, Kent, moved into their rented, terraced  bed property in . Now the plain home has now been redesigned with amazing wall art, canvases and furniture, all with a bold and colourful feel. Yet despite the incredible look of the house, Flo has only spent an astounding £ on the project. The jewellery production manager, said: The vinyl printed wall art came to a total of £, with the wall tape and paint amounting to an additional £ and the remaining furniture and d cor costing £. Flo has a knack for bargain hunting, although interior design on a budget was never her first intention. She said: Money was never really an object for me, but Iaposve always been good at finding uses for cheaper things and reusing items. Itaposs been a big factor to my creative process, I would always rather collect the materials first and then see where I am instead of spending loads of money on the finished product. As it is a rented home, I never wanted to spend loads on something I wasnapost always going to be in, however it was also important for me to be comfortable and to enjoy my home. Flo started the project at the beginning of lockdown last year, after previously struggling with her mental health.  When the lockdown was first started, it gave me a chance to get back in touch with my creativity, she said. It was incredibly therapeutic and great for my healing process after a dficult period of time. I have always been a creative person, regularly designing clothing and jewellery when I was younger, but I always wanted to get into interior design.Flo credits online s like Instagram and Pinterest for giving her confidence and inspiration.She said:I never had the confidence to go for it until I started interacting more with the online communities. They are so informative and helped give me inspiration for my own ideas of removable decor for rented homes, and to take existing things and put my own spin on them. I have used my Instagram page as a creative log where Iaposve regularly updated our homeaposs journey. Floaposs favourite rooms in the home are her two bedrooms located upstairs in her home.  She added: We have two bedrooms upstairs and the main bedroom is more laid back and relaxed which I love. My usual style is sort of everything, everywhere but this room was a little more considered more mature than the rest of my style. The spare room has been unoccupied for the whole of lockdown and beyond really, so I just went full out and had loads of stuff in there. Her favourite pieces of furniture in the house were very dficult for her to decide on. She said: I noticed a trend in the online community with colourful, upcycled drinks trolleys which I thought was really cool. I bought myself one and the gold colour was really faded so I spray painted it bright pink, which I am really proud of it, it was simple but effective. I also recently tried leather painting a smaller green, modular sofa bench we have which I was also really happy with. Floaposs husband, Oli, has always been supportive of her creativity at home. Flo said: He isnapost really involved in the styling, but he loves taking pictures of the home for the Instagram page, so I think we make a good team.  He enjoys being surrounded by something thataposs a bit dferent, and it is always fun to have people over and see their reactions. Itaposs been a journey, and there has definitely been times where we havenapost been on the same page with ideas, but we always share our opinions and its very democratic. Floaposs friends and family have always also been really positive when it comes to her home design. She added: I cannot ever recall any negative comments we have had from loved ones, but we have definitely had some negative comments online which people see to have more confidence in sharing when they do not know you. Funnily enough, our landlord has never been the biggest fan of the project, but he is aware that everything is removable and not permanent, so he is understanding.  He is a carpenter and when we moved in the house was full of quirky wooden features which we both loved, but it was just too bland, and I always knew I wanted to add my own touch to it. The couple are expecting a baby in February next year, and are planning to leave their property soon, as they have recently bought their first home together. Flo said: Itaposs a really exciting time for us right now and I am sure when we are moved in at some point, I will start designing again. As we are excepting though it is definitely getting put on the back-burner for some much-needed rest and relaxation!

Jo McMeechan, , lives in Bristol with her husband Alex, , and their two sons Rory, , and Arthur, . During the pandemic Jo, who is a paediatric physiotherapist, has seen both her children have mental health problems.A week before lockdown was announced, Jo and Alex decided to shield their household, as Rory had just recovered from sepsis and had severe asthma, making him extremely vulnerable to coronavirus.However, this “signicantly impacted” Rory’s mental health. “He really struggled, especially with the social isolation,” said Jo.   “He missed his friends and had limited opportunities to safely get outdoors as the advice for him was to shield for  weeks. Rory struggled to sleep and had no motivation for anything, and he also became very tearful and distressed most days. He couldn’t understand why he wasn’t allowed to socialise with his friends.” Jo said that when schools reopened for the children of key workers, she made the decision to send Rory back, as he just wasn’t coping with the social isolation. “My husband and I were seriously concerned about the effect this would have on him in the long-term,” she said. “We thought the risk of Covid was less than the damage to his mental health, so we took a key worker place at his school for him and the dference that we saw in him as the social isolation lted and his education became more stable was incredible. However, I still don’t feel he is fully back to how he was before the pandemic.”  Jo and Alex’s younger son Arthur however struggled with coming out of lockdown. Arthur is Autistic and has ADHD, as well as Sensory Processing Disorder which means he has problems with sitting still, focusing, and regulating his emotions. “On the flipside, Arthur really well during the pandemic, but going back to socialising has been a real challenge as his anxiety is through the roof,” said Jo. “He’s had to go back to school on a reduced timetable of  minutes a day at most. We have a lot of dficulties taking Arthur out without it causing him distress. He’s run out of school gates towards traffic to avoid crowds or hidden in bushes to avoid people. “It’s been very challenging, especially now things have fully opened up.  He wants to do things but gets too overwhelmed. Recently we went to our local harvest fair and he got out on the green and saw the crowds of people and sat down hugging his knees and refused to move. “Before the pandemic, this was never a signicant issue for Arthur. He would have thrived in those situations before.” Jo said her and Alex were left managing their children’s mental health by themselves. “We talked to their school about getting help from the nursing team there, but we were told access to resources was zilch and there was pretty much nothing available for us,” said Jo. “From my experience as a health professional, a lot of our community teams were redistributed to Covid or were having to isolate meaning there were not enough people working in a system that was already overstretched, so although we discussed access to help for the boys it seemed asit was going to be a futile quest for a referral. It has been so hard for my family.” Rory and Arthur are two of several children the Mirror has reported on to expose the impact of the pandemic on their mental health.The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All. We’re calling for:Early Access Mental Health Hubs for under s to be rolled out across the country, with at least one for each trust.

Ruth Tunniclfe, , claims she was duped out of £, after falling for a violent criminal in the US who promised her a business opportunity when she was living in Cornwall. But she said he took her on a transatlantic hell ride. The mum-of-three, who was  at the time, said she was going through a orce with her now ex-husband when alleged fraudster Peter McMahon targeted her online in .She said he promised her a whole new le and he started stalking her on Facebook and bombarded her with messages until she finally caved in and answered for a laugh. She was with her daughter at the time who she said he promised a modelling contract.He had the gt of the gab, he was completely charming - promising all sorts and thataposs how it started, she told The Star.After exchanging phone numbers and talking every day, the alleged fraudster persuaded her to come to Nashville so Ruth sad she booked a -dayticket on February , . Describing the moment they met at the airport she said: To start with we were head over heels. It was so romantic. He was fun, he was very very popular and everywhere we went people seemed to know him and he would introduce me as his fiancé.  She added: He was so convincing about everything and said we were going to have an amazing le and build this business together. Ruth said that she never actually got to stay in his home as they travelled around the US and she claimed he he tricked her into paying for hotels. But she said she became trapped in the US she was unable toto her children after her passport went missing one day before her flight. Ruth was rapidly running out of money and started to see a switch in her partner around April when she started to run low on funds and aposliving it up on her credit cardapos. The terried mum said she was completely broken and knew thatshe spoke out of line - it would trigger a brutal attack.  I knew that I had to get away from him somehow because he was turning on me all of the time and getting more and more violent, she said. He would pin me up against the car seat with his hands around my throat and he would just turn on meI asked any questions. After months and months of picking up the tabs to eat and her credit card pin being burrowed, Ruth finally found her passport when the pair went to visit his sisteraposs house some time in April. They started to work in a bar to make ends meet and worked without a salary after the alleged fraudster proposed to the bar owner that he paid for their expenses instead. She said: So thataposs how he got us hotels and we mostly ate food at the bar but most of the time we were sleeping in the car - which at one point was really hard.  Recalling the day she planned her escape, she said: I thoughtwe canapost get a parking spot outside the bar we would have to go two blocks away and I could say that Iaposve left something in the car. She was praying to God that there wouldnapost be a parking spot so she could escape and alert police. Luckily, there was nowhere to park nearby which meant that she could put her plan to action and insist that she later went back to the car. She said she was shaking from top to toe and ran to the car to retrieve a tiny case that had her belongings hidden in it before she fled to a police station. I remember it was a circular door and I went through this door and collapsed on the floor in a heap, Ruth said.  As she cried out for help in the Nashville police station she then relayed her terrying ordeal to a police officer who took her to a room. The woman just held me and said aposhoneyyou hadnapost left him youaposd left this country in a body bagapos. She claims that police arranged for surveillance outside of McMahonaposs sisteraposs house, so she could stay with her until the sister contacted her family to book a flight back to the UK in October. Ruth said the fraudster tried to call her once she ed to the UK and said the last thing he said to her was: aposYouaposll never get your money back you stupid English f**kapos. She added: He knew that I was orced, he knew that I was vulnerable and he knew that I was probably low. There is a very high emotional cost with it all, but my story has to be told.Peter McMahonaposs whereabouts remains unknown but according to American news site SiLive, he was arrested for allegedly creating a fake festival to benefit autistic children in Staten Island in .Ruth is now happily married in Leeds and is getting ready to publish a book about her horror ordeal.To keep up to date with her work visit her website here.

Even with the closure of Orient car parks ,  and , there are plenty of parking spaces available for visitors as well as public transport links We want to provide a safe and accessible environment for all our visitors. This means that certain areas of our car parks, such as pedestrian walkways and emergency exits, need to stay clear at all times. We also need to ensure that accessible bays are kept clear for visitors who require them. Due to a small minority of visitors parking in these areas, we have re-introduced our Sensitive Parking initiative to encourage safe and appropriate use of our car parks. The Trafford Centre said any queries need to be directed to Workflow Dynamics on    or enquiries@workflowdynamic.

Whenever you sign into a website, a pop up noties you of being one of over billion usernames and passwords that have been fraudulently obtained and advertised by hackers. In , Google Jenner Pullman explained the huge amount of usernames and passwords flagged during the applicationaposs scans.Since our launch, over , people have participated in our early experiment, she said.

Hackers purchase enormous databases of compromised passwords from ious sites because the letter combinations are often reused. By forcing long lists of known hacked passwords - rather than trying random letters or numbers - they are more likely to obtain account access. Hijackers routinely attempt to sign in to sites across the web with every credential exposed by a third-party breach, said Pullman. If you use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, this risk disappears.The tool may pull from site breaches like the  LinkedIn hack, the Sun reports.The hack saw credentials of .million LinkedIn users being obtained and sold in lists online.

With last winter disrupted by lockdown, and young people missing so much school, college, time with friends and seeing grandparents, getting the vaccine will help make sure this year is a whole lot better. Not only does the vaccine protect young people against serious illness – almost  per cent of Covid patients admitted to hospital are unvaccinated – it also means they’re less likely to spread the virus to elderly family members. No more FOMO We’ve come a long way with the vaccination programme since those dark days of last winter. The Covid- vaccine has already saved more than , lives and prevented  million infections.Jabs are now being rolled out for the - age group, and more than  per cent of --year-olds have already had theirs. And getting the jab couldn’t be easier: schools and colleges are offering it through their immunisation programmes, while older teenagers can make an appointment through the online booking service at nhs.uk covidvaccination.If you’re a parent orof a --year-old, schools will ask for your consent before they receive the vaccine, and you can help --year-olds book their dose online. Then it’s one less thing for you to worry about – and they won’t need to worry about missing out on all those good times with family and friends.Fashion and lestyle influencer Arabella Daho , , is keen to book her vaccine appointment. “I think the vaccine is a great thing for everyone to have – it’s helping to keep us safe, she says. We have loads of events coming up such as Halloween and Christmas, and we don’t want to miss them. “On my digital s I’ve interviewed a few of the doctors who worked on the vaccine, talking about how safe it is, and why it’s important for everyone to get it. It was good to talk to them – I learned a lot, soanyone wants to see those videos or do research to help them feel better about getting the vaccine, I think they should. “Young people think they’re immune to everything, but we can actually be spreading Covid, especially to older people, who are more vulnerable. So getting jabbed helps communities and families get back to normal.” ‘All my kids have had their vaccines’ We asked GP and mum-of-three Dr Dawn Harper about what the vaccine means for young people… How do you feel about your kids being offered the vaccine  All my kids are in their s and they’ve all had their vaccines. I was very keen for them to get vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. If I had a -to--year-old I’d be putting them forward for the vaccine. We’ve been able to draw on global data several countries have already been offering the vaccine to --year-olds, and we have a lot of evidence to show that it’s safe for that age group. And while young people are less likely to become seriously ill with Covid, I am in total agreement with the chief medical officers concerning the impact on their mental health and their education, and also the possibility of long Covid. And, of course, we are only enjoying the relative freedoms we have today in the UK because of the vaccine programme. Without it, we’d still be in a lockdown. We need the vaccine to protect ourselves from Covid and long Covid, and also to protect our loved ones and our community. So I’m very keen for young people to come forward and have the vaccine. Did you have to persuade your children to have the jab  They were up for it. For me, lockdown was easier: I’m  and don’t mind walking my dog on my own, but I think young people really struggled missing out on their social lives.  What are the side effects of the vaccine in young people  The main one is perhaps a bit of soreness in the arm. I had a sore arm after my first vaccine but nothing at all after my second. It’s incredibly safe. I’m still amazed at how the researchers worked to get this to market as quickly as they did, running trials simultaneously without cutting safety corners. Long Covid is a worry for many parents. Will the vaccine protect young people against it  I have patients with long Covid. It is a horrible condition and there is evidence that the vaccine protects against this. We’re still on a very steep learning curve with long Covid. It’s unpredictable. We have fit young people who have been knocked sideways by it. The things that people talk to me about is the fatigue, the brain fog – I’ve got patients who are very intelligent academics who just can’tat work. Is the vaccine suitable for vegans and people with food allergies  It’s totally vegan-friendly and not a problem for those with allergies. What about those who are scared of needles  For the -to- age group, school nurses are well experienced in managing this. If you’re nervous you can ask to lie down. You can also buy over-the-counter cream to rub into your arm  minutes beforehand. I don’t even think I felt my second vaccine going in it’s such a tiny needle. For a moment of a sharp scratch, to know that you’re protected against Covid it’s well worth the trade-off. Has the vaccine been rigorously tested on the younger age group  Yes, I feel very confident about the science behind it. There’s been a lot of debate on risk vs benefit in dferent age groups. Young people are less likely to get seriously ill, but we need to weigh that against missed education, protection from long Covid and letting kids get out and about again so that we can help them with any mental health issues. If you come from a middle-class background where you’ve all got your own computers, home schooling was much easier thanyou’re all trying to share one screen, so it’s really important that we try to even out those dferences and get people back into the classroom.Last winter’s lockdown was so tough on young people’s mental health. Does the vaccine mean that things will be better this year  That wouldbe my hope. We’ll see messages coming out about meeting outside and ventilation I still wear a mask in the supermarket we have hand sanitiser in our bags and our cars, and I think that makes sense. But expanding the vaccine programme to include these younger people will mean that hopefully they can start to get back to some kind of normality. AGED  OR  If you have a teenager who hasn’t booked their vaccine yet, you can give them a helping hand so that they don’t get left behind – and protect the rest of the family from serious illness. Jabs can now be booked online at nhs.uk covidvaccination, or you can ask your GP or go to your nearest walk-in centre. PARENT OR CARER OF A --YEAR-OLD Offering young people the vaccine is essential to prevent them missing school and help make sure they can carry on doing the things they love with their friends and family. Everyone in this age group will be offered a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine through their school’s immunisation programme, which already administers the HPV and MMR vaccines. Parents and s will be asked for their consent via a form – andyou have any questions you can discuss them with the School Age Immunisation Service."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds announces big changes menus","story":":root McDonald’s announces big changes to menus and restaurants to look after the planetFast food giant McDonald’s have announced important changes to its menu and its restaurants as part of an ongoing commitment to achieving net zero emissions by this.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video mcdonalds-launches-first-plant-based-,customFields:,clearance:Site Only,source:cacdbecdaca,sourceUrl:PR,site:Mirror,brandSafety: General news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:fFXbndc,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Meghan was a working royal for a short time after her wedding to Prince Harry in May , but the couple decided to quit the UK and move to America in early .Now in an updated version of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, an unauthorised biography by Andrew Morton, it is claimed Meghan found it hard to bond with some royals. He writes: It was clear that Meghan had ruffled feathers in the family and that they felt she and Harry were very dficult to deal with. For her part, Meghan found some of its members – not the Queen or Prince Philip – unfriendly and jealous.At a personal level, then, their departure from Britain was quietly welcomed by some in the Windsor family and their courtiers, but on an institutional level it was a heavy blow. The book also claims that Meghan found le inside the royal family as institution slow, repetitive and, quite frankly, unimaginative.

Click here to sign up .Morton adds: Her own endeavours, particularly the Grenfell cookbook and the capsule collection she had overseen for Smart Works, were the type of projects she wanted to work on – and they could take place outside the royal world.Since leaving the royal family, Meghan has given a bombshell interview to Oprah Winfrey, where she said there was a lack of support within the institution and she felt isolated as she battled mental health issues. She also claimed that one of the royals had made comments about how dark son Archieaposs skin would be before he was born.Speaking earlier this year, on the Channel  programme Meghan at : The Climb To Power, royal author Tom Quinn said Meghan wanted to shake up the royal family. He said: I think the problem for Meghan was that she was angry, she was upset. “I think that she thought when she entered the Royal Family she could shake them up and they would love it, she would do things Meghan’s way. He continued: When that didn’t happen and she came up against what she saw as the forces of reaction it made her so upset that, that interview [with Oprah Winfrey] was her way I think the only way for her to get her revenge and put the case as she saw it. But I think later on she will think I shouldn’t have burnt my bridges to that extent.

Walter overcame adversity at every stage in his le then made the biggest sacrice of all to defend his country. Born in Folkestone, tragedy struck at a very young age when he lost his mother to breast cancer aged seven and then his dad passed away from heart disease just two years later. After losing both his parents, Walter and his brother Edward found themselves in a precarious and vulnerable position before being taken in by an orphanage in Bethnal Green. But there was more heartbreak to come when Walter was separated from his brother, who was adopted by a couple in Glasgow, leaving him alone. Walter was encouraged to pursue his love of football and started playing for amateur team Clapton FC, but soon he was spotted by the mighty Tottenham Hotspur, becoming one of English footballaposs first professional outfield players.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. At the age of just -years-old, Tull signed for Spurs in  and soon found himself playing at White Hart Lane in front of crowds in the tens of thousands. Tottenhamaposs club historian, John Fennelly, explains that youngsters are fascinated by Tull and want to hear about his impact on the club and footballer in general. At the time we was about the best going, explains John. Somebody everyone wanted. We were delighted to get him here. He remains an incredible hero to us all hero. He is massive in our history. The legacy is amazing. Tull was subjected to horric racial abuse from the stands, with a newspaper reporting a cowardly attack on him during a match at Bristol City in . One newspaper report at the time described how, during a match at Bristol City in , a section of the crowd made a cowardly attack on him in language lower than Billingsgate. The reporter wrote: Let me tell those Bristol hooligans that Tull is so clean in mind and method as to be a model for all white men who play football. In point of ability,not actual achievement, Tull was the best forward on the field. When his career drted at Spurs following the abuse he suffered, he signed for Northampton Town in  for a substantial fee, but he gave up his football career at the outbreak of the First World War. Tullaposs le went down a very dferent path when he bravely enlisted with Middlesex Regiment, part of a aposFootballersapos Battalionapos that drew professional players from a range of clubs, just four months after the war began. He rose to the rank of lance sergeant and fought in the Battle of the Somme in , then was sent home after suffering from shell shock. While an officer cadet stationed in Scotland, he became the first black player to sign for Rangers FC and intended to play for them after the war. At a time when only white British-born people could be trained as an Officer, Walter became an exception to the rule and started training.  He ed to the battlefront with a promotion, becoming the British Armyaposs first black officer and the first to command white troops. Between November  and March  he served on the Italian Front and was praised for his gallantry and coolness by Major-General Sydney Lawford. He led  men on a night raid against an enemy position across the cold River Piave and was recommended for the Military Cross. Sadly, in March  he was killed near a village in northern France during the First battle of Bapaume in the early stages of the German Armyaposs Spring Offensive. As testament to how much he was respected by the men serving around him, they desperately tried to recover his body despite coming under heavy fire. His body was never found but his le is commemorated at the Arras Memorial - and name engraved with , other soldiers with no known grave who died in the area.  A lasting memorial and remembrance garden in the shadow of Northampton Townaposs stadium also remembers his le, as well as a postbox painted black in his honour in Glasgow last year. During an ITV documentary in , Spurs players Dele said he heard about Tullaposs story when he first joined the club. As part of the documentary, Alison Hammond: Back to School, the presenter headed to Spursapos stadium to discover more about the inspiring figure with his great-nephew, Ed. In a heartwarming moment, Dele made a surprise appearance to present Ed with a signed shirt that has his great-uncleaposs name on the back.The UK began celebrating Black History Month, an idea first spawned in the United States and then also adopted by European countries including Ireland and the Netherlands, in October . Black History Month helps give context to modern le and the countryaposs history, while championing the experiences and celebrating the contributions of Black Britons here in the UK. The observation was first organised through the leadership of Ghanaian-born analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo. He served as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council. Consequently, Akyaaba created a plan aiming to recognise the contributions of African, Asian and Caribbean people to the economic, cultural and political le in the UK. The Spurs player said: Ed this is for you. The Tottenham motto here is aposTo Dare Is To Doapos. We believe Walter embodied everything is about. Alison sits down with Dele to discuss how the story of Walter has impacted his career. Itaposs a story I heard about when I first joined the club and Walteraposs story really meant a lot to me and means a lot to many of us, explained the England midfielder.

Here we look back at how they developed their bond and now enjoy being in each otheraposs company... Early relationship Kate and William started dating while they were students at St Andrews University in Scotland.And it appears even in those early days and before the pair announced their engagement in , Charles welcomed his would-be daughter-in-law into the family with open arms. In an interview to mark their engagement, Kate said Charles had been very, very welcoming and very friendly. She admitted that she was nervous to meet her future father-in-law but added: It couldnapost have gone easier, really for me. Wedding tribute Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .Months after their engagement was announced, Kate and William wed in a grand ceremony in Westminster Abbey in April . Proud dad Charles was there to watch his eldest son tie the knot and gave a tear-jerking off-the-cuff speech about the couple during a champagne reception at Buckingham Palace.And according to Hello! he described Kate as like the daughter he never had and said: We are lucky to have her.He then wished the couple a letime of happiness together.  Although joint public appearances between Kate and Charles have been few and far between, when they have happened, the pair are often spotted sharing private jokes. Last year in a visit to a veterans rehabilitation centre in Loughborough, Kate was pictured in fits of giggles as she stood next to her father-in-law.William and Camilla were also there on the visit, and body language expert Judi James told the Express that by wrinkling her nose, Kateaposs laugh shows genuine humour and rapport.She added: The affection Kate clearly feels for her father-in-law could be one big thing she has in common with Camilla. Healing rt between Charles and William  Despite Kate and Charlesaposs sweet relationship, the bond between Charles and William is said to have been rocky in the past. But according to reports, it was Kate herself who helped to smooth things over between her husband and father-in-law. And she did this by reportedly helping to organised a family portrait for Charles for his th birthday in . According to the Daily Mail, Kate was instrumental in making the portrait happen, which sees Prince George and Princess Charlotte beaming and cosying up to both Charles and his we Camilla. While the Duchess herself snapped a lovely symbolic photo of Charles and his eldest son on Williamaposs birthday in , in which Charles can be seen resting his head on her husbandaposs shoulder.Organising grandparent time Charles is now the proud grandfather of five grandchildren, including Kate and Williamaposs kids Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. But previously there had been claims that Charles, , was unhappy he did not get to see enough of the trio. In an interview two years ago to mark Charles th birthday, Prince William echoed the sentiment. He said: “I would like him to have more time with the children… to, you know, play around with the grandchildren. When heaposs there, heaposs brilliant, but we need him there as much as possible.”To this end, Kate is said to have urged Charles to visit their home Amner Hall last summer and took on the logistical challenge of getting her family back home from a holiday on the Isles of Scilly to coincide with his visit.In doing so, it was reported that the heir to the throne was able to give his grandson George a seventh birthday present in person. Comfort at funeralEarlier this year, the royal family were left grief-stricken when Prince Philip died aged  at Windsor Castle. AndPrince Charles looked visibly emotionalat his fatheraposs funeral as he led the procession to St Georgeaposs Chapel.After the ceremony, Kate was spotted comforting Charles by putting her hand on his shoulder and giving him a kiss on the cheek. Sweet nickname He goes by the names of His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales and Charles - but Kate appears to have an endearing nickname for her father-in-law - showing their happy relationship.Kate, Charles, William, Camilla and the Queen were all at a drinks reception at the G summit in Cornwall in June. And it seemed as though Kate referred to Charles as grandpa as they arrived at the reception at the Eden Project.A lip reader told CornwallLive that the Duchess of Cambridge had used the moniker for her father-in-law.Comment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince Charles, Prince of WalesRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the updated chapters of his unauthorised biography, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, Morton explains how the two women, both thrust into the spotlight, were still getting to know each other when Meghan married Prince Harry. Here, body language expert Judi James takes a look back over Kate and Meghanaposs most photographed moments together to decode exactly when their friendship started to go sour - and unsurprisingly, how the public focused on them rather than the two royal brothers who were actually feuding... The relationship between these two royal women was built on three huge assumptions: firstly that they were naturally destined to be the closest of chums and allies, like Diana and Fergie were. Second that Meghan would enter the royal Firm at the same ‘level’ and state as Diana and Kate - i.e young, nervous, lacking in experience and in need of support, protection and hands-on coaching. And the third and biggest assumption was that William and Harry were the royal version of Jedward the very tightest of brothers who only needed a second we to turn their rather lopsided trio into a very idealistic ‘Fab Four’. Most of these assumptions were sexist. The phrase ‘The Merry Wives of Windsor’ might have been there waiting to be dusted off for use in some new headlines, but Diana and Fergie were pals before Fergie caught Andrew’s eye. Nobody ever expected Prince Philip and Anthony Armstrong-Jones to start dressing alike and skipping about together, or even Beatrice and Eugenie’s Eddo and Jack. And there was no way on this planet that a super-confident orced woman close to  with a career as a Hollywood actress, who was a very active and passionate speaker and campaigner, was ever going to need much hand-holding for this new role. If she did she had her husband on hand to fill her in about protocol and traditions. I believe Kate might even have been daunted by her new sister-in-law’s confidence, energy and professionalism. And of course Katewere also thrown into service as a smokescreen for a bigger and more unthinkable rt between the royal’s own version of Jedward.   The not-so Fab Four The stage appearance to launch the ‘Fab Four’ was gruesome. Kate and Meghan appeared to have been dressed from the same royal dressing-up box and seated in similar poses to make it look like the launch of a new royal doll for the ‘collection’.Meanwhile, the brothers were clearly already locked into some form of conflict - asked whether there had been disagreements between the couples during the planning of the launch, William’s Oh, yes was instantaneous and sounded heartfelt. Meghan dropped her head and placed a hand up in a cut-off gesture as though to hide her face, and the chuckles from Kate looked like nervous giggles.Kate was pregnant and sitting back in her chair, so although the idea of not having the ‘energy to bond’ with Meghan sounds like an odd sick note when most pregnant women continue their careers, let alone their social lives, she clearly can be unwell during her pregnancies.But even so, despite matching frocks there was already a sense from Meghan and Kate’s body language that Meghan’s experience, passion, drive and urgency for her cause was in contrast to Kate’s method of sitting back in her seat and watching the on-stage sibling tussle with a polite smile. Kate had spent years being marinated in royal rules, procedures and restrictions, so Meghan’s sense of purpose for a cause must have hit like a bath bomb. The post-wedding tears trip to Wimbledon, July Following rumours of tears during prep for Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, the two women put in a very ‘Diana and Fergie’ body language display at the tennis to signal publicly that all was well and suggest they really were the best of pals. I wouldn’t be too sure that a bit of ‘thank you’ jewellery sent out in a post run that included bridesmaids in the posh equivalent of a circular e-mail would be too telling, but the body language here did suggest an intention to log friendly rapport from both women, suggesting they were united in their messaging at least.There was a lot of eye contact and appreciative gestures from Kate here to signal she really was bonding with her sister-in-law, and the mirroring between the women did hint they were enjoying one of the key interests they shared.There was even some whispering and giggling together behind hands poses to help suggest they now had a more than just polite relationship and were beginning to look like genuine friends.Wives at war  The very sexist tone of two women being locked in some ‘cat fight’ continued though, despite the fact that we now know it was the men who had the real problem in their relationship.Kate and Meghan are two very dferent personalities, and dressing them the same was a pretty clichéd way of insulting two successful women - but I’m pretty sure they would have happily performed many years of politely smiling PDAs had the brothers not been locked in their rt.The balcony poses and photos of the two women at more formal events might have looked iconic in terms of defining a rt, but the context is slightly wrong. Perhaps because of William and Harry’s spat the royal pecking order was suddenly more defined at these events, and Harry and Meghan always seemed to be pushed back into the chorus line behind William and Kate. Where the two women appear to be standing together wearing icy expressions and ignoring each other, they were in fact standing one behind the other, so happy chats would have been dficult. At this point the tension on Harry’s face and the haunted expression in his eyes told all the story of what was about to come but attention was of course focused on the two women at the time. Even at the first Commemoration service, it was Kate and Meghan’s body language together that soaked up all the interest. Here they stood together in mirrored poses, wearing polite smiles, but it was their husbands wearing the haunted eye expressions while patently ignoring each other.The Christmas  walk to church threw up the kind of ‘denial’ body language we normally only see from politicians or Strictly contestants who have cheated on their wives. Kate took up the challenge to signal all was truly happy between herself and Meghan in what was obviously a set piece for the cameras. While William and Harry walked on the outside, yet again free from all the interest and speculation of a rt, it was up to Kate to step across to Meghan to chat and smile to suggest a relaxed and spontaneous moment of friendship. Meghan kept her arm linked into Harry’s and her bag as a barrier between herself and Kate. The Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant with Prince Louis at the time but solo, unaided walking was surely still on the menu, although she did turn her head and smile to form an appealing-looking pose for the press.It was during the very last outing for the now not-so Fab Four that the tension was much more obvious and palpable. A mutual gloom appeared to settle over William and Kate as they arrived to take their seats in the pews in front of Harry and Meghan.Even Kate’s signature smile had vanished on what was Harry and Meghan’s last gig before they fled to the arms of Oprah.We didn’t get to seeMeghan’s bravely polite smiles of greeting were ed by her sister and brother-in-law, but the way her beaming smile dropped like a brick suggested they were not.

Cara Donovan, , was a wedding guest at Country House Weddings Ltdaposs venue Leez Priory - a th Century Tudor mansion near Chelmsford, Essex. The manor, which is nestled in  acres of parkland, has been repeatedly voted the UKaposs Best Wedding Venue. The special needs teacher is now suing the company in charge of the reception for £, after slipping and breaking her elbow on their state-of-the-art twinkling dancefloor in September . The -year-oldaposs elbow was badly broken and she was left with constant arm pain - which still impacts all areas of her everyday le.  Despite three operations, Caraaposs arm says she is still in agony, and she has been unable toto teach at school. Country House Weddings Ltd, which owns Leez Priory, were told by the suppliers of the high-tech dancefloor that it would be a slip-hazarddrinks were spilled on it, according to documents filed at the High Court. But nothing was done to prevent guests taking liquid on the dancefloor and the companyaposs adverts even showed photos of people drinking and dancing, Caraaposs lawyers claim. During the evening guests would go onto the dancefloor - either to cross it or to dance - holding glasses of drink and occasionally spilling drink onto the dancefloor, says her barrister, Philip Goddard.  The dance floor became wet with patches of spilt drink. The danceflooraposs underfloor lights made it dficult for those on the dancefloor to see spilt liquid on the surface. At about pm, the claimant went onto the floor to dance. She slipped in the spilt drink, fell and fractured her right, dominant, arm. Doctors have performed three surgeries on Caraaposs broken arm, but none have healed her permanent pain and weakness, the lawyer claims. The mother-of-two, from Romford, canapost write, drive, use a keyboard, or handle any two-handed machinery after her injury. She would like toto teaching, but is inhibited by the injury, says Mr Goddard. A fourth operation may be needed to remove a bone fragment, but its present condition is unlikely to improve. Cara blames Country House Weddings Ltd for her injury and the impact it has had on her le. She claims the company didnapost follow the supplieraposs no drinks warning and failed to enforce it by putting staff at suitable locations around the venue. Tables were also placed at the danceflooraposs edge, which Cara claims encouraged people to drink and dance. Staff also failed to move guests to mop up spilled drinks, it is claimed. Country House Weddings Ltdaposs defence was not available from the court. Caraaposs claim has not yet been tested in evidence by a judge.

After the Covid pandemic her school changed its toilet policy, locking in pupils during lessons. Students are able to use the toilet during lessons atthey have a toilet pass. But the teenageraposs dad, who did not want to be named, told NorthantsLive it was embarrassing and distressing for young women to be forced to signpost when they are on their period. His daughter, who wants to remain anonymous, was on her menstrual cycle and needed to use the toilet urgently at the beginning of September, shortly after schools reopened. She had to use her phone to text her mother, who then phoned the school to ask them to let her daughter use the toilet.  A young woman should not have to jump through that many hoops to be allowed to maintain her hygiene and dignity, the concerned father said. A policy such as this would not stand in any workplace. He wrote to the school and has attempted to call them to speak to a member of the senior leadership team, but he was told there is no one available to speak to. The school has defended the policy, saying it has been introduced to maximise teaching time and avoid disrupting lessons. NHS guidance says that people who menstruate should change their tampon or sanitary towel at least every four hours, and preferably more often. Depending on flow, this can be much more regular.According to childrenaposs charity Plan International UK, % of girls aged between  and  in the UK feel embarrassed by their period.The parent added: Iaposm certain that any child in need of the toilet, especially for personal hygiene reasons, is less likely to perform at their best within the lesson. This alleged policy change seems to have very little to do with improving education NIA. This change appears to be a show of force, NIA exerting their dominance over every pupil. I find it absurd that school leaders would consider removing the option for children to use toilet as a suitable, ethical or sustainable way to control behaviour. When asked about the situation regarding this student and the effects of the toilet policy, Northampton International Academy said the policy was introduced to maximise teaching time.  A spokesman told NorthantsLive: After ing to our normal school routines we have reintroduced systems where the main school toilets are open for use as normal at the start of the day, during break times, lunchtimes and at the end of the day only. Pupils are therefore asked to use the facilities outside of lesson time whenever possible. “This has been reintroduced to maximise teaching time and avoid disrupting lessons. During lessons pupils can use the bathroomthey have a toilet pass. We are continuing to monitor this system.” But the father said this is not a viable solution for his daughter, or others like her. My we has spoken to the school who have stated that our daughter may be able to get a special pass to use the toilets, he said. I may be older now, but I can certainly remember the social pressures of school. Yet I simply cannot imagine the distress it might cause for a young woman be required to wave around a signpost that she is on her period. In June this year The Mirror told of a similar incident when a -year-old was punished for leaving to go to the toilet when on her period. The school girl then stood up to use the toilet she was told to “sit back down” by her teacher. She left the class anyway, and was put into “seclusion” for the rest of the day as a punishment.

The cosy property in the tiny hamlet of Pant Glas, Wales, is nestled between rolling hills which make for stunning views. However it comes with a number of compromises that most home owners would be used to.Instead of a full kitchen thereaposs a larder that has a sink, counters and fridge, but without a water connection or a cooker, Wales Online reports.Thereaposs also no shower or bath and no room for indoor toilet facilities, as any one who needs to go will have to pop to the outhouse in the shed.  On the plus side while the living room is small it somehow manages to fit a two-seater sofa, armchair and even a wall cupboard and classic Welsh dresser. There is also a small bedroom which fits a double bed, but one that has to fold up in order to create more space in the daytime.  With space in the rear garden the cottage could potentially be extended into the garden to create a larger kitchen, bedroom and install a shower room. The home is going to informal tender, which means that potential buyers submit a competitive and private bid by a set date.  The seller decides the then decides which bid to accept and the sale progresses as normal. This means that at the affordable price, the tiny house could be a potential first home. The cottage is being sold by estate agent Bob Parry, who state that the property is to be sold by informal tender and all tenders must be submitted in writing to their Caernarfon office no later than noon on Friday, November .

And for millions of us, its enigmatic founder, Tom Anderson, was the first digital aposfriendapos who appeared on our profiles.As Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp all went down on Monday, social media users began to reminisce about their earliest days on the internet.While many got nostaglic over the simpler times of sites like Myspace, it appears Tom, , has no plans to resurrect the once-mighty network. In , the man known as aposMyspace Tomapos sold the business to News Corp for millionbefore retiring four years later. As the website rapidly fell to its all-conquering rival Facebook, Tom took an early retirement - and has been living the dream ever since.  Teen hacker sparked FBI raid before brainwave A computer genius from an early age, Tom attended San Pasqual High in Escondido, Calornia - but had some surprising extracurricular interests. Going by the pseudonym aposLord Flatheadapos, he incredibly attracted the attention of the FBI as a teenage computer hacker. Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newsletters According to TechCrunch, at the age of  he was the subject of one of the largest FBI raids in Calornian history after hacking into the Chase Manhattan Bank computer system and showing his friends how to do it.The website reported that one day in   agents stormed the homes of Tom and his friends and seized  personal computers. Our source says the FBI was expecting a serious criminal conspiracy ring of hardcore hackers, not a group of teens led by Anderson, a high school freshman, it added. As a minor, Tom escaped arrest and moved to Taiwan after graduating from the University of Calornia, Berkeley.  After ing to the US, he met Chris DeWolfe while working at XDrive, a digital storage company. When the business folded, they founded and later sold their first company, direct marketing group ResponseBase. In , they decided to set up the first pages of Myspace as a challenge to the social network game Friendster - quickly becoming two of the most influential tech businessmen on the planet. Myspace aposmismanaged in every way possibleapos By , Myspace had become the biggest social networking site in the world. The website was especially a hit with teenagers, who were able to customise their own profiles, add and interact with friends - features that would similarly go on to inspire Facebook. At the height of its success, however, the company was sold to Rupert Murdochaposs News Corp, with Tom staying on as president. Following the acquisition tensions emerged, with Tom admitting: Before, I could do whatever I wanted. Now it takes more time to get people to agree on things. All the budget reviews and processes. That can be a pain. But itaposs not stopping us. By , however, Zuckerbergaposs Facebook had become the go-to social media  and users deserted Myspace. Tom stepped down in , as the workforce was slashed by  per cent to , staff. By June , just  were left. That same month, Specic Media Group and singer Justin Timberlake jointly purchased the company for approximately million - a fraction of its price just years earlier. In October , Murdoch admitted he had made a huge mistake when asked about Myspace. Insisting everyone thought it was fantastic that News Corp had managed to snap up the site at its peak, the tycoon said his company managed to mismanage it in every possible way. Living the dream as travel photographer with m fortuneSo what happened to Tom  Over the years he has cut a publicity-shy figure - his Twitter profile for a long time reading Enjoying being retired.Over on Instagram, however, he was active until , sharing snaps of his incredible new le as a travel photographer. Now based in Hawaii with an estimated million fortune, he appears to be living the dream as a semi-retired millionaire, exploring all corners of the world from Thailand to the Males. Former st friend! Surfing, travel photos, architecture-design, DogDad, his profile reads, also revealing that he is an investor in Elon Muskaposs SpaceX business. Alongside beautul snaps of his trips to Singapore, Bhutan and the Philippines, he also shared some words of advice for his , followers. Lately I’ve been meeting a lot of “lost” people that seem to suffer from a crisis of confidence, he wrote in one post. I’m trying to help where I can. You don’t always have to understand the path forward. It’s OK to be lost at times. Crisis begets growth.According to Cheetsheet, Tom bought a swanky .million pad in West Hollywood in  that previously belonged to The Chainsmokers star Drew Taggart. While he barely posts these days, he did pop up after Donald Trump was banned from Twitter in the wake of Januaryaposs US Capitol riots.In just his second tweet in three years, Tom posted a meme of the former president looking at a computer screen with Myspace on it, with the caption reading: aposMyspace Tom’ about to get a new friend. Another tweet went viral last year when user Jack Murphy wrote: Remember Tom  Remember how he just sold his m share in myspace and retired so he could have a nice le  He never sold our data, never tried to influence elections, never lobbied against privacy legislations... what a man. Myspace was just too pure for this world.

The Middlesbrough school today insisted the vast majority of parents support their request.Ayresomeaposs Executive Headteacher, Charlotte Haylock, also confessed parents will not face consequencesthey continue to flout the schoolaposs pleas, Teesside Live reports. She added: I hope that all parents follow the advice that Iaposve given. Ms Haylockaposs polite request comes after the school posted a message on their Facebook on Friday calling out the inappropriate garments at the gates. It said that dressing gowns on the school yard are not appropriate. Parents who had children attending the school agreed with the request and they said they are disgusted to see others in their PJs. But images from Monday morning, showed a man who turned up in slippers, cosy grey robe and dark pyjamas and another woman wearing a hooded fluffy gown, colourful pjs and trainers.The school said: Please can we ask that all parents carers dress appropriately when dropping off and collecting children from school.Dressing gowns on the school yard are not appropriate. Parents at the school gatesapos seemed to agree with the schoolaposs stance. One dad, who asked not to be named, said the pyjama-wear is sported by some parents on the school run.  He said: Iaposm absolutely sick of it. Itaposs not hard to get dressed in the morning. Imagine how much those kids are going to be ridiculed when they get into school. They donapost even put on a fresh pair to come and collect them. A lot of the parents are disgusted by it. Parent Aimee Baker, of Middlesborough agreed and said it has been going on for more than a decade. She said: My oldest who came here is  now and they were doing it then. Theyaposre local parents and it takes only two minutes to chuck some clothes on so thereaposs no reason. Theyaposre taking the kids to school in their pyjamas and coming back in the same ones. Itaposs embarrassing for the children. Thereaposs no excuse you should get washed and dressed every morning.  Other parents at the gates were in agreement and had concerns about the children being mistreated because of it. One mum said: It takes two minutes to take your dressing gown off and put a coat on. Itaposs not just a dressing gown though itaposs full pyjamas, then a dressing gown and slippers. Itaposs just normal around here now. Another parent, who asked to remain anonymous said: The mams shouldnapost be coming to school in their pyjamas. Theyaposre night clothes for a reason so why would you come out in them during the day time. The children will think itaposs acceptable and start repeating it. The dad-of-two said he does not believe the school request will change the way parents dress and claimed the issue is getting worse. He added: They never listen to what the school says so I doubt itaposs going to change unfortunately.

The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, said she is fed up with cars parking outside her house which made it impossible for a disabled friend of hers to visit.She claims she already asked politely a number of times in previous notes and had enough when her disabled friend could not visit, reported the Manchester Evening News.Ellie Newman, , from Whitefield, claims she discovered the note stuck with silicone on the windscreen of her car after she finished work last Thursday. She and sister Jordana Timeyin, , who both drive Range Rover Velars in black and white, park their vehicles on a street close to where they work in Whitefield.  The siblings, who work at Loan Agency Bridgewater Acceptances, say they have had notes left on their windscreens on several occasions including being stuck on the glass with glue. The latest note in black felt tip pen read: Please stop using this street as a car park. Residents are coming home from work shopping and can not park on their own street!! Ellie said she and sister Jordana are perfectly within their rights to park there, as they both pay tax. But the disgruntled resident said she wants to see more consideration for people who live on the street.  She said: My friend wanted to visit, I was making him a dinner as he can barely walk now without a stick and canapost stand up to cook. But he couldnapost come as he couldnapost park his car outside my house. Without being able to park right outside, he couldnapost walk down the street, so he couldnapost come. The woman said some residents have three carsit is a family where both parents work and their grown up children also drive. But she says the street, made up of Victorian houses, was not built for cars and there is no possibility of building inidual drive ways. She says the problem is exacerbated by people who donapost live on the street using it as a place to park their vehicles. She said: I am not a nasty person and would not do anyone a bad turn. But this has been going on for  months. There is a back to the shops where they work and I am sure they could park there. I make no apologies, I have not been rude or malicious. Ellie reported the incident on line to Greater Manchester Police. The resident said: It is not criminal damage, the substance I stuck it on with was easy to peel off. It was like a plasticine. It was a reasonable request, I was not rude. I just explained how things were from a residents view point. If you are parking there all day you must know you are causing a problem for somebody. I donapost like seeing how we have become a very selfish society. I have no time for it.

His sister Sian - who was allowed to see him for the first time on September  - said his future prognosis is still uncertain. Josh was released from a rehabilitation centre to the care of his family in time to celebrate his birthday, but is facing a long road of recovery. Sian said: When we dropped down to level  lockdown in Auckland recently, one designated visitor was allowed to go and see Josh each day for an hour and he and I were finally reunited. Josh was so happy when I visited and his mood has lted since the visits started. I was over the moon to see him and was quite emotional.Heaposs progressed really well in the rehabilitation centre, although he has had a few falls due to the blood not going to his brain fast enough when he stands up. Heaposs had a temperature and also low blood pressure - his heart beats faster than it should.Weaposve been told that when we get to level  in the pandemic, Josh will be able to have his operation. But he has been told that his skull, that was removed originally to relieve pressure on his brain after the incident, is no longer suitable and that a replacement skull will be made for him. The family were delighted to have Josh with them in time for his birthday. Sian added: Being with us will go a long way to aid in his recovery and mental wellbeing. He will be an outpatient and still receive after care. I wouldnapost say itaposs the exact same Josh as before the accident, but I would say mostly. Heaposs forgetful, heaposs going to have some trouble with problem solving and things like that, and emotions can be up and down hour to hour. In terms of the damage, thataposs irreversible. Thereaposs quite a lot of scarring on the frontal lobe. The doctors are shocked that he got this far to be honest. They told us to prepare for the worst, so to be honest I think heaposs a bit of a miracle. The procedure Josh underwent to remove a bond flap is called a craniectomy andnot replaced with the original bone either a metal plate, or a synthetic material will be inserted. His medical expenses are expected to be covered by insurance. The family are also frantically fundraising to cover their living costs in New Zealand for the next few months. They are also waiting to hearthey will have to pay quarantine expenses of £, orthey will be waived.A total of £, has been raised on a GoFundMe page Help the Storer family get to Josh set up by a friend of the family and more money has been raised by friends in New Zealand towards the cost of flying and staying in the country.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON New ZealandCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

practice is to undergo a £, transformation to provide state-of-the-art facilities for poorly pets across the region.Donview Veterinary Centre in Inverurie will undergo a major internal renovation to expand facilities and increase their patient footfall.The multi-award winning practice currently employs  vets, seven veterinary nurses and  receptionists and office staff.The extensive renovation, the largest of its kind for the Blackhall Industrial Estate based practice, will see the number of consult rooms increase from three to five with an investment in new technology.The project will be the biggest investment in the practice and has been made possible with funding from VetPartners, a veterinary group which owns some of the UK’s most respected and trusted small animal, mixed, farm and equine practices.Expanding facilities will enable Donview Vets to provide wider specialist services, including a higher level of surgery, as well as having visiting specialists to treat pets.Donview Vets clinical director Charlie Carnochan said: “The practice already had excellent facilities, but this investment will put us as the top of the game and really enhance what we do for clients and their pets.“It will create a great environment to work in, which is so important for our team members.#We want it to be a place where people really want to come to work and have the best available equipment and technology so they can provide a great service for our clients and their pets.#The expansion will see the creation of a third theatre to facilitate more specialised operations and referrals.Improvements will also be made to a number of facilities including a dental room with radiography, the refurbishment of their imaging room with upgraded x-ray machines and separate instruments room for sterilisation of surgical kits.The revamp will also see an increase in specialist services ranging from physiotherapy, acupuncture and veterinary nurse clinics.Donview Vets is also planning to create a large room upstairs so they can host client evenings and education events about pet health.Staff will also benefit from the transformation with the creation of a large open plan office for team members.Vets and nurses will also be able to enjoy revamped facilities, including two bedrooms for on-call vets working overnight, a kitchen, shower room, relaxation area with lockers and a training room for team members to advance their skills and learning.Mr Carnochan added: “Our clinical facilities and equipment, including critical care equipment, have been massively upgraded in advance of this work being carried out, and we will be able to offer extra specialised services.“We have always been a practice that has invested, but having VetPartners’ backing has taken what we can do to a new level. They work in collaboration with their practice teams and support them to provide the best possible service for clients and best possible care of patients.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.57876837-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.57876837-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.57876837-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/2.57876837-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"drink driver who was six times the limit loses licence and his 60000 range rover","story":"A drink-driver who was SIX TIMES the limit behind the wheel of his £, Range Rover has been heavily fined and had the vehicle seized.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

The P  team drew six tries-all and the P- team won by six tries to four.Next they played Kintyre with the P s losing by five tries to two and the P s winning again four tries to three.The last game for both teams came against Oban and this time the P  team won by three tries to one and the superb P  team won by five tries to three to complete a clean sweep on the day.Lee Buckley of Mid Argyll RFC said: #The coaches at Mid Argyll would like to thank two under- players, Donald Self and William Wilson, who came along on the day and refereed all the games.#I think the boys were surprised by the quality of the rugby and the speed of some of the mini players, as they tried to keep up with them.#During the day Argyll and Bute rugby development officer Andrew Johnston took all the girl players aside to record a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team who took on Spain the following day in a crucial world cup qualying match.The message must have done the trick as Scotland ran out  #  victors to keep their world cup dream alive.If any young people would like to play rugby either as a ing player or a complete novice, training sessions for all primary age children and S- high school girls is at pm on Tuesdays on the rugby pitch at the joint campus in Lochgilphead.High School training for S- boys and girls is held on Thursdays at pm at the joint campus.For any ing ex-players or novice adults, men and women who want to give rugby a try for the first time, have a look on Mid Argyll Rugby Club#s Facebook page for details of when the #old-timers# touch rugby sessions are being held.This week#s Dalriada festival on September  is being hosted by Oban Lorne RFC.Players should arrive at Oban Rugby Club no later than .am for a noon start.PICS:Mid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllMid Argyll P  team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllDonald and William refereed the games. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllThe girls had a great day # and even recorded a good luck message for the Scotland women#s national team. no_a_RugbyMidArgyllAction from the P  match between Mid Argyll and Etive Vikings, which Mid Argyll won by six tries to four.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn. Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces, and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is Heuchera.Native to north America, Heuchera were originally grown for their flowers # dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and wpring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"gardens of argyll in new tv series","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowTwo Argyll gardens will appear in a new BBC ALBA series which started last week.Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba, or Gardens of Scotland is presented by Murdo Macdonald, and the programme will feature Ardkinglas and Benmore gardens.In a programme screened on Thursday September  and available on BBC iPlayer, it was the turn of Ardkinglas Garden at the head of Loch Fyne.There, Murdo finds out about the model railway that used to run along the lochside, and wanders around the azaleas bursting with colour in the Ladies# Garden.He walks up to the old mill by the river, then explores the champion trees and renowned rhododendron collection in the Woodland Garden.He also finds out more about the fairy garden for children which is made up of lots of little houses next to the bottom of tree trunks, laid out in trail.#The fairy garden attracts thousands of families each year so it#s become a destination in itself,# said Murdo. #The Ladies# Garden with azaleas is also well worth seeing in summer it’s stunning because it#s ablaze with colour.#On October , Gàrraidhean Mòra na h-Alba will showcase Benmore Garden at the end of Loch Eck, a regional garden of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.Murdo visits the Victorian fernery, the Tasmanian Ridge and the Chilean Rainforest Glade, where he plants a monkey puzzle tree.Murdo said: #Benmore is a dramatic garden in its terrain with amazing views and you could easily spend days walking around, just taking in what’s there.#There’s a wildness to the garden that isn’t as apparent at some of the other more formal gardens which can almost make you feel as though you’re in a dferent country.#"},{"url":null,"title":"glendaruel hosts tighnabruaich open","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowGlendaruel and Colintraive Gun Club hosted the Tighnabruaich Open on September , the first club competition to be held since March .The High Gun of the day, after a three-way shoot off, was Ted Blakeway.In second was Alan Brown third, Paul Chalmers and fourth equal were Martin Young,  Gordon Grfiths and Eric McAllister.The ladies prize went to Jessica Young.

This included him having a relapse when we thought we might lose him.He was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition and needed a long course of treatment and regular blood tests but thankfully he pulled through.Sadly, Red’s story is not an isolated case. Many animals arrive with us when they are literally broken.Some have suffered for a long time, carrying physical and emotional scars. Animals can’t tell us where it hurts, why they’re sick or why they’re scared.It’s our job to uncover what has happened to the animals and what treatment they need.Red’s happy ending is the best possible outcome for us. To see the broken animals which arrive with us go on to loving forever homes. It’s the reason we do what we do.We don’t just fix broken bones. We fix broken hearts too.The Scottish SPCA receives no government funding and is entirely reliant on donations from the public.To find out more about our Broken campaign and becoming a member of the Scottish SPCA, visit www.scottishspca.org brokenanimals.Jo Neilson, Scottish SPCA senior vet"},{"url":null,"title":"action packed day for young soccer stars","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

Sturgeons weekly update to Parliament took place this afternoon following the introduction of the vaccine passport scheme in Scotlandon Friday.Covid cases in Scotland have fallen in recent weeks,

today.... No changes to the current rulesNicola Sturgeon confirmed that there would be no changes to the \"albeit, limited regulations\" still in place in Scotland.This is because, according to the first minister, the numbers have continued to fall.However, she also said that despite falling cases, the infection rate still remainsrelatively high which is of concern as we head into the winter months.It is for this reason that the current limited measures, such as mask wearing,will remain in place in Scotland.Explaining this, the first minister said: \"the level of infection, though falling, remains relatively high and so we consider that it is prudent at this stage, as we approach winter, to keep in place the remaining mitigations, face coverings for example, for a further period.\". Covid cases in Scotland remain steadyA total of , daily cases were recordedtoday, a slight increase on yesterdays figures which were below ,.However, the \"signicant and sustained fall\"in cases over the past few weeks is now being reflected in the number of hospital admissions, according to the first minister.As a result, Nicola Sturgeon continues to remainoptimistic about the general downward trend in numbers, following a period of daily figures topping , throughout August and early September.Describing this as a relief, she said: \"Given that cases are continuing to fall, we hope and expect that the number of people in hospital will decline further. We also expect that the number of people dying from Covid will reduce.\". School mitigation measures such as mask wearing in class under reviewThe mitigation measures currently in place in schools areunder review, particularly whether pupils will continue to have to wear masks in schools after the October break.The body conducting the review is expected to come to a decision on such measures later this afternoon and will then advise the Scottish government.The first minister added that\"should they advise that any easing is possible following the October half-term, the Scottish Government will consider this carefully and advise schools of any changes as soon as possible.\". Acknowledgement of initial problems with Covid status appNicola Sturgeon acknowledged the problems related to the app, particularly the issues downloading vaccination status on Thursday and Friday, and apologised.Explaining the source of the problem, the first minister said:\"Essentially the high level of demand after the launch of the app ndash combined with an error in one part of the NHS system ndash meant that information wasnrsquot being sent quickly enough from the NHS system to the app.\"She added: \"Indeed, I can report that the initial backlog of people waiting for their information to be matched had been cleared by Saturday lunchtime.\".

Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white bells.They carry their plume like flowers high above their crowns of leaves, but gardeners are now mainly interested in their foliage which comes in a iety of colours.Heucheras grow in full or partial sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent clearing up after the summer and preparing for the winter and spring ahead so here are some top tips for jobs next month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"connor is tarberts junior champion","story":"The threat of wet and windy weather did not daunt the enthusiasm of the young golfers, who took part in three dferent competitions.The junior champion was Connor MacRae, group three champion was Aiden Kerr, group two champion was Jack Sinclair and group one champion was Macey Fair.As part of their prizes, the children received a British Open top from Portrush which was kindly signed by European Tour star Robert MacIntyre.#Congratulations to everyone who participated and many thanks to Lesley at Loch Fyne Gallery for her sponsorship,# said a club spokesperson.#Thanks to Captain Kenny for organising the coaching and the championship.

inspired by one on Campbeltown Cross, a late medieval carved cross which is one of the town#s most iconic monuments.The design on the logo – with long hair and scales – is based on detailed

the day.However, McCallum had to be on his guard to help his team at the other end after a Harmony Row striker rounded keeper Craig Lamont, but the striker#s side-footed finish did not have the pace and the recovering McCallum cleared the ball off the line.Michael McKinlay, himself playing through the pain barrier, slotted in at right-back, and the Pupils steadied the ship slightly before the half-time interval arrived.However, there was further bruising for the Pupils on the pitch with only  minutes played, when Harmony Row made it -, after a ball, again from a wide position, was turned home first time into the roof of the net.The match was then put well out of the Pupils# reach after the visitors scored their fourth goal with an hour played.A similar rout to the Pupils# - defeat to the same visiting team on league duty in early September looked to be on the cards.The final  minutes of the match was positive for the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils, thanks in part to the introduction

he turned provider for sweeper John McCallum to side-foot firmly home from close range to get the Pupils off the mark.Into the latter stages, the scores could have been higher on both sides, prevented

There were two lighthouses at the harbour entrance: one on a northern clf and the other to the south. These were intended to guide vessels through the portrsquos channel which had dangerous sand banks on either side.ldquoBut heavy rain prevented The Starrsquos crew from seeing the lights properly and there was a breakwater to be avoided before the harbour could be taken.ldquoOn entering the port, a huge wave bore down on the boat, threatening to throw it onto the breakwater.ldquoThe crew took what evasive action they could but, sadly, the boat was dashed against the masonry pier with such force that she quickly broke up with the tragic loss of all the crew but one.An active search was made but none of the bodies were reportedly found at that time.Almost five months later, the body of the skipper was found by fisherman William Cross, washed ashore at Dunwich, on March , .Newspapers reported at the time of memorial services being held in Musselburgh and visits made to grief-stricken families by the provost.Stuart Ritchie said it was believed that the skipperrsquos body was the only one found.He said: ldquoAfter a good deal of searching over a period of time, recently I found my great grandfatherrsquos death certicate. I feel very sad that, apparently, Jamesrsquos body was never found so a funeral may never have taken place.But he added: ldquoIt is good that the descendants are meeting up.ldquoIt would be even betterthe wider community in the Musselburgh Fisherrow area was made aware of this heritage and perhaps the local authority could do a bit to help here.He felt a lasting memorial to the crew of Star of the East at Fisherrow Harbour would be a fitting tribute to them.Mr Johnston added: ldquoAttending our harbour ceremony felt like stepping back into the past to remember and honour, not only James Ritchie and the other brave men of The Star who lost their lives, but also to allow us today to pay tribute to every family within the Fisherrow fishing community for the important contribution it has made to the economy and history of Musselburgh over many years.Walter Brown jnrrsquos great grandson Walter Moffat, , who lives in Toronto, Canada, visited the skipper Walter Brown snrrsquos grave at Dunwich in early  where a memorial stone had been placed by his widow Jane lsquoBonthronrsquo Brown.He said his ancestor was seen by commanding everyone to ldquosave themselves as he held the mast going down with the ship.ldquoCoincidentally, Walter Brown jnr forgot to take his bible on that trip ndash I have it at home, said his descendant who is the grandson of Walter Brown, the son of Walter Brown jr and Elizabeth Brown , who was just one when his father died in the shipwreck.The Scottish Fisheries Museum at Anstruther is planning to mark the th anniversary of the loss of The Star at its annual memorial service in the museumrsquos Memorial Room in October.

It captures an imagined moment in which the legendary Viking Althamer sails along the coast of the Firth of Forth.It is the work of Andrew Hillhouse, an artist who sadly died in  at the young age of . I wish I had been wise enough to seek him out and talk with him about history and his art when Irsquod had the opportunity.His widow Vicky has told me of his modesty, that he wouldnrsquot call himself an artist because he was a working man with a job to pay the bills. He once wrote that he was ldquostill just a guy who likes to doodle in his spare time.Some doodles! His art is stunning: full of historical detail and atmosphere, and his work portrays many aspects of Scottish history, which was one of Andrewrsquos passions.His website has many more examples of his art, with short explanations to accompany them.He grew up in Prestonpans and knew the local legend of the townrsquos beginnings that it was founded by a Viking traveller named Althamer, who was shipwrecked with his crew on its rocky shore after a ferocious storm about a thousand years ago in the th century.As Andrew himself wrote: ldquoStories from this period are very dficult to very, but the legend persists to this dayhellip the image shows Althamerrsquos ship passing Bass Rock as the sun sets on the evening before their hard landing on Scotlandrsquos shores.But although this is a legend and not history, we do know that there was Viking activity around East Lothianrsquos shores in the th century. For example, it is recorded that the Norse king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson, raided Tyninghame in AD and died soon afterwards.And perhaps he lies buried there. In , the farmer at Auldhame, Mr Dale, ploughed up bones. An archaeological dig took place and an Anglo Saxon monastery was revealed. A male skeleton was discovered buried there with items that identy him as being a high-ranking Norse warrior.It canrsquot be said for sure the skeleton was the remains of King Olaf himself. But itrsquos a fascinating possibility.The thing is, we have tiny historical glimpses of this time, with archaeology sometimes adding to our knowledge while also sometimes adding to the intrigue.To this, we can add the stories, told down the generations, at the firesides of the common folk. These stories often had their origin in an account of someonersquos experience, or a memory of an event, which then evolved to become part of folklore and legend.Since the story of Althamerrsquos arrival was set in a time of extensive Norse and Danish settlement, the idea of Prestonpans being founded by a shipwrecked Viking is not entirely fancul. There was, after all, a Viking settlement a few miles down the coast at Luffness, by Aberlady Bay.So Andrewrsquos image of Althamer and his crew sailing to their fate along the East Lothian coast is now part of the telling of this legend.The story lit my imagination and interest in history when I was a youngster growing up in Prestonpans. It still does.Irsquove often stood on its shore in a storm to watch the waves crash against the rocks in a rage, and see in my mindrsquos eye the Viking longboat being smashed.There is so much in this picture for you to discover, and it speaks more words than I can write.So I will leave it with you.It is produced here with thanks from Vicky Hillhouse, who gave her permission to use it on this page.But she has also kindly given permission for its use by local schoolchildren, who are now the younger custodians of the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"sight-loss-support-a-blessing-prestonpans-resident-agnes-78","story":"Agnes Stevenson, , of Grant Road, received her age-related macular degeneration diagnosis in  when she was a full-time carer for husband Tom, who had dementia and passed away last year.Struggling with the impact of her sight loss, Agnes reached out to the charity Sight Scotland through its newly launched telephone support line ndash she has since praised the community service for helping her feel less alone.The Sight Scotland Support Line, launched across Edinburgh and the Lothians in January as part of the newly formed Family Wellbeing Service which launched last Wednesday, offers people with sight loss and their families someone to turn to for information, advice and support.The retired bookkeeper said: ldquoI didnrsquot know anything about macular degeneration.ldquoWhen I was told I had it, I was devastated.ldquoAt that time, I got no information at all.ldquoIt was a huge shock.

Edinburgh exposed.The Prince lost no time before he entered the Capital in triumph with his army of Highlanders, rough types who were capable of anything.After Cope had loaded his troops onto ships at Aberdeen and sailed for Dunbar, the two armies met at Prestonpans on September , .Many of Copersquos troops were inexperienced recruits and his officers were a feeble lot.Early the following morning, when the Highlanders charged, Copersquos dragoons fled in panic, leaving the infantry exposed.Had the humane Prince and his officers not interceded, a bloodbath might well have have ensued, with no prisoners taken.The craven Cope fled to Berwick-upon-Tweed with some of his officers and a rabble of surviving soldiers.He faced a court martial but was exonerated, the cowardly conduct of the soldiers being blamed for everything.He obtained another appointment as Governor of Limerick but never held an independent field command again.There was an early rumour among the Scottish victors that Sir John Cope had overslept on the morning of the battle although it inspired the rousing bagpipe tune Hey, Johnnie Cope, Are Ye Waking Yet , that version of events is not true.Then there was a story that although Prince Charles had spent the night before the battle on duty with his men, Cope had slept at comfortable quarters in Cockenzie.This tale was reported by the Edinburgh historian Robert Chambers as early as , although Copersquos  biographer Sir Robert Cadell found it yet another calumny: in spite of the assertions of Chambers and others, Cope had slept with his troops on the battlefield, as veried by the Culloden Papers and the Proceedings of Copersquos court martial.In his  biography of Prince Charles, the mischievous W. Drummond Norie lsquoimprovedrsquo the old legend further, claiming that Cope had been spending the night at a comfortable house in Cockenzie, nowadays referred to as the lsquoInk Bottlersquo and pictured in his book.

turned down by East Lothian Councilrsquos planning committee.The proposals, recommended for approval by planning officers, were rejected by a single vote.Mr Sutherland, who works in the town, appealed to Scottish Ministers to see the plans given the green light.Rosie Leven, the reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave the planned three-storey building at  High Street and land to the north the go ahead.Neighbours overlooking the proposed three-bedroom house had objected to the planned property, which measures just over four metres wide and  metres long, on the grounds of privacy.Mrs Leven attached a condition to the approval that a balustrade should be included on the roof terrace.She said: ldquoI consider that the proposed first floor kitchen doors and roof terrace are part of the main living space of the proposed house and are likely to be more regularly used, during a larger proportion of the day, than the bedroom windows.ldquoI consider that it is from those first floor windows spaces that there is the greatest potential for an adverse effect on neighbouring residential amenity.ldquoIn this respect, the appellant has suggested that a condition could be placed on the consent to require a . metre balustrade around the three open sides of the roof terrace.ldquoIn the circumstances, I find that such a balustrade would help to reduce the ability for overlooking, both from the roof terrace itself and from the double doors to the kitchen.ldquoTaking this into account, I accept that there may be some overlooking from and to the proposed bedroom window, but with the addition of a balustrade, I consider that the overall impact on the amenity of the neighbouring properties would not be signicantly adverse.Concerns had also been raised about whether the proposed building was in keeping with the character of the town centre.The Reporter noted that traditional buildings ldquodominate the area but added ldquothere are dferent heights and styles of building.She said there was ldquono consistent building line on Forth Street and the character is one of buildings offset from each other, providing interesting views and angles.The proposals originally went before the local authorityrsquos planning committee in January, with six of the  councillors voting to reject the plans.Councillor Jane Henderson was joined by fellow North Berwick Coastal ward members Jim Goodfellow and Jeremy Findlay in speaking out against the plans.She told the committee that the width of the home would be ldquonot much wider than a shipping container, my goodness gracious.She said: ldquoI am not convinced this is the best place for a Grand Designs experiment, adding: ldquoJust because theoretically it can be done does not make it right.Grand Designs is a popular and long-running home improvements television show presented by Kevin McCloud where unique and daringly designed homes are

That he lost to vested southern interestsisnrsquot the issue.Contrast him with the present and previous Secretaries of State, Alister Jack and David Mundell. Like Scottish Tory MPs in general, they simply do not fight on any issue for what used to be called the ldquoScottish Interest. That is the problem for Mr Ross not ldquoclass.Add to that the advancement of an oligarch like Malcolm Offord, a man who apparently believes in cutting state expenditure by one-third , and it seems the Scottish Tories are more in tune with the s than the s. I do not regard ldquonationalism as a real issue in Scotland, butit were, then Mr Ross should be aware that ldquoScottish nationalism would always be preferred over ldquoBritish nationalism.GR Weir, Ochiltree.UNTRUTHS FROM DOUGLAS ROSSIT constantly amazes me ndash but why should it  ndash that politicians can twist the truth any which way they want. In the row over Labour deputy leader Angela Raynerrsquos comments regarding ldquoTory scum, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives suggests at the Tory conference she was referring to the votersand describes them as ldquonormal Scots looking for a party that can stand up to the SNP. They are people like me, my family and my community.Douglas Ross says: ldquoThese voters arenrsquot as Angela Rayner would say lsquovilersquo. They arenrsquot lsquonasty. They arenrsquot lsquoscumrsquo.Ms Rayner was reported as saying: \"We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute pile of banana republic, vile, nasty, Etonian, posh... piece of scum. Some quote that! But the fact is she wasnrsquot talking about the voters, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson and members of his party.So why is Mr Ross allowed to make  accusations and see them reported without any debate Is he simply following his leader and learning the best way forward is to continue to tell untruths because voters donrsquot know any better  And would he tell himself thatrsquos what ldquonormal Scots would expect Andy Stenton, Glasgow.SWISS SYSTEM WOULD HAVE SUITED USON one hand it is encouraging that Peter Russellrsquos proposal for a new Act of Union would include the right of one nation to \"withdraw\" unilaterally . It is though telling that the requirements he would impose for that nation to do so are not the traditional requirements of the UK polity. The tradition in the UK, which has been used in every election with the exception of the Scottish Assembly referendum in , has been ldquoone vote is enough.Philosophically I can understand Mr Russellrsquos point, but does he not recognise thatthere is to be such a rupture in UK tradition that there is some onus on him to justy this  Political expedience wrapped up in philosophical principle is not a justication for abandoning tradition.I would say Brexit was a major change, but had it come to it, one vote would have been enough. Brexit, as Mr Russell says, might have been a debacle, and like him I consider it a terrible act, but it is the tradition of how the UK does politics.Perhaps mindful of this, the majority requirements he cites are from other than the UK: Switzerland and the United States. The former is particularly interesting, since what he meansis that for a proposition to pass, there must be a national majority but also a majority of Cantons . Applied to the UK, Brexit would never have happened as two \"cantons\" ndash Scotland and Northern Ireland ndash voted Remain, so denying the double majority that would have been required, had this been the UK tradition. Politically that would have been most interesting in the UK but would be accepted in Switzerland as part of their political tradition.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.BREXIT HAS NOT FUELLED INDY VOTEI WOULD like to thank Ruth Marrfor her response to my letter of October . However, in doing so I fear all she has done is confirm the two main problems the independence movement suffers from: preaching only to the choir and deflecting away from the failures of the SNP.Ms Marr is absolutely right when she notes it is up to the unionists to make the case for the Union. What she and many of her fellow independence supporters fail to understand, and the point I was making, is that a similar burden rests on them to show why independence is better than the status quo. They failed to do this in  and need to convince people like me who voted against independence that it is worth it.I should point out that by Ms Marrrsquos own logic this should be simple. If it is better then it should be easy to list the places where Holyrood is better. Instead, the list of failings from both governments is staggering. While I am old enough to remember a time when the SNP was not in power at Holyrood, people currently reaching voting age are not. And they are much more likely to know who is in charge of what in Scotland and who to blame.As for her reference to Brexit, it should be noted that while Scots may not like Brexit, that does not mean they want to vote for independence to escape it. Support for independence did not increase after the Brexit vote it has not increased much in the years since. In fact, the only time support got above % for anyof time was when the SNP stopped talking about independence to deal with the pandemic. Food for thought there.John Shanks, Glasgow.FIGHT FOR A BETTER UNIONRUTH Marr states the untruth which she frequently peddles, about \"crucial decisions affecting Scotland which are made at Westminster by a government Scotland did not elect\". As Ms Marr knows only too well, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has only one main government, democratically elected, and it is up to us to vote as we see fit when a General Election takes place then she states that \"we are currently suffering the consequences of being dragged out of the European Union by a Tory government\". As Ms Marr knows, we were dragged out of Europe because the majority of our population voted to do just that ndash not just against a healthy \"no\" vote from Scotland, but also many other areas of the UK, including London and its surrounding areas. Lastly she states \"independence is normal for almost every other country in the world\". Scotland is a normal country, and part of the United Kingdom, and therefore independent.I do not knowMs Marr has read Ian R Hamiltons book, No Stone Unturned, retelling the theft of the Stone of Destiny, but that gentleman ndash a strong nationalist ndash makes a fascinating statement as part of his introduction to his book: \"If we do not solve the problem of Scottish government, people less moderate than we are will sweep us aside and make of Scotland another Ireland.

I have also visited Scotlands hills and coasts over many years, from Sutherland to the borders and all in between. Pylons and towers have not distracted my appreciation or love of our beautul land.Now aged  I recall my childhood in Bridgeton, Glasgow, walking to Hosier Street Primary in the late s in yellow smog-filled streets with my handkerchief tied round my nose and mouth. On removal the white hanky had two dark brown holes for nostrils. And all done four times per day, sometimes for days on end.The effect on Glasgow citizens health was immense in terms of lung disease. The cause was from coal-burning in every tenement and factory chimney.In time smoke controls were implemented but years of work then followed as the city erected scaffolding and buildings were shot-blasted to rediscover the beautul architecture hidden beneath the soot encrusted walls.Part of the Glasgow skyline was also peppered with huge structures called gasometers, like grotesque alien ships, for storing the city gas supplies. Great rusting hulks which rise and fall depending on the volume of gas inside. Not pretty to look at but necessary for the citizens needs at the time.Coal has gone. Nuclear has risks as in Fukashima and Three Rivers events. Oil is to be transitioned away from. So wind and solar has to be in the mix with possibly new hydrogen power options. We just cant have our pristine countryside and reliable power supplies without some penalties. Sorry, but it cant be done.Bob Wolfenden, Biggar.AVOID KNEE-JERK EVERARD RESPONSEI READ with interest the letter from Denis Bruce .He makes a number of well thought-out and well-intentioned suggestions, several of which are unfortunately unworkable.All the talk of ldquo the arrestee and about at least two officers and no handcuffs is commendable but would change nothing and could in fact make matters worse.Back in the day I made more than one off-duty arrest whilst alone. For example, one was in the middle of the night and it was an inidual who had broken into several cars and stolen a lot of property. Another was in the middle of the afternoon. I had become suspicious and followed an inidual into a very secluded wooded area. He was with a very young and very distressed child and I intervened seconds before before he raped her. He was a big man with inordinate strength. This was horric andMr Bruce had his way then presumably I would have had to just stand by Regarding handcuffs only for violent prisoners, then this takes no account of those who subsequently become violent or who secrete drugs or weapons on their person. They need to be secured before they can dispose of the drugs or use the weapon against the arresting officer.The events surrounding Sarah Everard are beyond evil. I truly cannot think of a more horric set of circumstances. I am confident that every serving and retired police officer , will be embarrassed, ashamed and mortied.I think it is incumbent on the entire police service , to carry out a root and branch reform of its recruitment processes and what should be far more stringent processes applicable to those who become authorised firearms officers . We currently have interviews, written exams, assessment processes for normal recruits and psychometric testing for AFOs but clearly this monster slipped through the net. The police service could take advice from other police agencies throughout the world and they could look at how operatives to our internal secret services within the UK are recruited. The police service clearly do not have a monopoly on all the answers.Something is wrong and needs fixed. It needs to be done calmly, and methodically. It cannot be done as a knee-jerk reaction.Stewart Falconer, Alyth.SCHOOL LIFE WAS JUST PANTSHOW things have changed from my time at a single-sex girls school from  to . I was reminded of what it was like when I saw the photo of the young ladies of St Columbas High School sanitising their handsI am afraid it wasnt the parents problem that interested me but whether the young ladies have to wear school knickers as \"Victorian\" as the ones in my day. I doubt it, as those pupils would probably not agree to wear the near-bloomers with strong elastic which were de rigueur. We had bottle-green oneswith a small pocket in which to keep ones handkerchief.The unorms we wore were tunics which came to the knee until, joy of joys, in the sixth form we were allowed to progress to skirts which came to near the ankles. It was the time of the \"new look\" so we felt very fashionable.

However, head coach Mike Blair believes that all four of the South African sides which have joined the league this year are getting stronger as they become accustomed to playing in European conditions, so has warned his team that they canrsquot afford to start slowly.ldquoTheyrsquore used to the type of game over here now with two games under their belts, Blair reasoned. ldquoStormers had an excellent first  minutes or so against Munster and not many teams go there and are  points up near half-time.ldquoMunster got back into it through their driving game, but Stormers when they hit their straps are a dficult team to stop.Blair added that while Edinburgh wonrsquot underestimate the challenge they face this coming weekend, the team will approach the match with confidence having quickly compartmentalised their loss to Benetton.ldquoWe had a team meeting and were frustrated, he explained. ldquoWe talked about shooting ourselves in the foot. But there was a load of positive stuff too, so it was a positive meeting about the good things that wersquove been doing.ldquoBut we did also reflect on the fact that we canrsquot give the opposition easy ins to the game through our basic errors, whether thatrsquos discipline or skill-based stuff.ldquoAfter  minutes we kicked the ball out on the full, and on  minutes  second wersquove got a line-out on their  to win the game, so you look back and of course yoursquore frustrated with how it turned out. But, as I said to the guys, itrsquos not asthese are dficult things to fix. We can turn these things around pretty quickly.ldquoThey were six wins from seven, playing at home, sowe had won that game that would have gone down as a really good away victory, he added. ldquoWe canrsquot then turn around and say it was a shocking loss.One of the big success stories for Edinburgh so far this season has been the form of Ben Vellacott, the -year-old scrum-half who joined the club from Wasps during the summer and has added an energy to the capital outfitrsquos play which was conspicuously absent last season under Richard Cockerill.Vellacottrsquos recruitment may have happened before Blair took up the capital reins, but the coach has been a long-time admirer.ldquoHersquos done well, hasnrsquot he  said Blair. ldquoHersquos someone we watched nationally for a few seasons. He had a bad knee injury [in September ] and didnrsquot get a huge amount of rugby after that. I was in touch with him a couple of years ago and gave him a bit of feedback on a few dferent things.ldquoHersquos an exceptional player. Give him front foot ball and hersquos going to tear the opposition apart. And the pleasing thing with Ben is hersquos not been a one-trick pony. Hersquos been able to play at tempo. but hersquos shown a really good organisation as well.As the nationrsquos most capped scrum-half and a former member of Gregor Townsendrsquos Scotland coaching team, Blair is ideally placed to assess whether the new man has got what it takes to push his way into the international frame this autumn.ldquoI think Scotland have strong scrum-halves, and George [Horne] and Ali [Price] probably have a fair bit in the bank, but the way that Ben is going,he can continue to show this consistency, hersquoll start pushing those two along with Jamie Dobie and Scott Steele, Blair said.Vellacottrsquos fine form has not been good news for the two other scrum-halves in the Edinburgh squad, with -year-old Henry Pyrgos managing eight minutes off the bench in round one against the Scarlets and -year-old Charlie Shiel being an unused sub against Benetton.This lack of game time is a particular concern with respect to Shiel, who has been on the books since the summer of  and has  appearances to his name, but only  starts. He is a player who has been on the verge of a breakthrough for three years, without ever getting a real run in the team.ldquoIt is dficult, said Blair. ldquoI am trying to give guys opportunities, but we donrsquot have Super we can fall back on because Covid means we need a week between playing Super and then coming back with us.ldquoI am as frustrated as these guys are because I am giving them feedback and telling them what they need to show, and the guys are saying: lsquoI know, but Irsquom not playing!rsquoldquoI know that answer is coming so I need to be able to facilitate ways for the guys to show me what they can do in training."},{"url":null,"title":"st-johnstone-confirm-liam-gordon-signed-new-contract-2024","story":"The -year-old centre-back has signed fresh terms to extend his McDiarmid Park stay until the summer of .A boyhood Saints fan, the defender has become an integral part of Callum Davidsons successful double-cup winning outfit.And with Gordon entering the last year of his contract, the club have tied him down on an improved contractCommenting on the deal, he said: \"This is a great day for my family and I.

Proposals also include “active travel” routes, e-bike chargers and welcome facilities, alongside coach permits and charging at some car parks.The programme is being funded with joint investment of up to £. million from the Scottish Government and UK Government, as part of the Islands Growth Deal — a ten-year investment programme jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, the three island councils and their partners from the public, academic and business sectors.During the in-person sessions, due to take place next Tuesday and Wednesday, attendees will be guided through proposals with representatives from project partners.OIC leader, Councillor James Stockan, said: “The Islands Deal commitment we have from the Scottish and UK Governments to support the Orkney Gateway is hugely gratying and reflects the position our World Heritage Site holds as one of the jewels in Scotland’s and indeed the UK’s tourism crown — not to mention the global archaeological signicance of the site.“But we must remember that at the core of this is a landscape and series of monuments which for many Orcadians is a direct, mysterious and powerful link to their past. And we know equally they are held very dear by people who’ve moved into these islands over the years.“So, as partners, we are all very clear that we want to gather local people’s views on the range of options that we could bid for through our final Islands Deal business case.”The consultation events are scheduled for Tuesday, October , at Maeshowe Visitor Centre, Stenness, from pm to pm, and Wednesday, October , at St Magnus Centre, Kirkwall, from pm until pm.If you’re unable to attend these events, further information is available at www.orkney.gov.uk orkneygateway.

This includes Memorandums of Understanding with Orkney Harbour Authority and Scrabster Harbour Trust to enhance port infrastructure and position the area more competitively to support offshore wind projects in the future.The announcement of this bid comes after the completion of the leasing round of Scotwind, a programme which will lease areas of the seabed around Scotland for wind farm developments.The Scottish Government hopes that as much as ten gigawatts of new generating capacity will be built over the next decade.Stephen Kerr, project director of the West of Orkney Windfarm, said: “While ScotWind has created the opportunity for a global industry to tap into Europe’s best wind resource, our consortium believes that success will be driven by targeted proposals built upon strong local relationships.”We have designed our bid specically around this location and brought together a unique combination of stakeholders to maximise the opportunities for the region.“In particular, the upcoming round of offshore wind projects are a terric opportunity for ports in Caithness and Orkney to win signicant long-term contracts in the installation and operational phase of these major infrastructure schemes.“Our agreements with Scrabster Harbour Trust and Orkney Harbour Authority will enable us to work together with a clear focus on long term delivery. Each port has its own specic capabilities and attributes, and on successful site award we have committed to fund collaborative design and supply studies and to invest where appropriate in improving each harbour’s infrastructure.“We will apply a similar collaborative approach across the supply chain, working closely with Scottish and UK suppliers to deliver on climate targets and enhance local economies.”The consortium has undertaken extensive site investigations, including birds, marine mammals and near-shore geophysical surveys, and has finalised a grid connection agreement with National Grid that will enable the project to commence generation in .Jim Buck, harbourmaster for Orkney Harbour Authority, said that Scapa Flow # the second largest natural harbour in the world # offers an environment like no other and said that the £million masterplan to develop ports around Orkney is key in attracting new business to the islands. “Our Masterplan embraces decarbonisation and a transition away from fossil fuels,” said Mr Buck.“It includes a range of infrastructure enhancements across key locations around the Orkney mainland, including a new deep-water facility in Scapa Flow, which will be crucial to us realising our ambition to deliver social and economic benefit from offshore wind energy.“The West of Orkney Windfarm is ideally positioned to make signicant use of these future facilities and this collaboration represents another key step on our journey to position Orkney as a base for innovation and a major contributor in delivering a carbon-free future for the islands.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4108705.jpg--.jpg?1632478259000\n","title":"craigdun bids fond farewell to wilma","story":"CRAIGDUN Private Nursing Home in Cullybackey has bid a fond farewell to Wilma Swann who retired recently after  years of dedicated employment.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.

Basic banking services is something the Post Office provides for all banks in Northern Ireland. Alternatively customers could consider switching their bank account.” Further advice and support is available on the Consumers Council’s website , including a branch closure factsheet, a personal banking guide, a guide to switching banks and a current account comparison table.

Her son was sent across the border for adoption and they never got the chance to meet.Her sister, Marie McCartney, was speaking at the launch of a report into mother-and-baby homes, Magdalene Laundries and workhouses in Northern Ireland, compiled by an expert  which has recommended a public inquiry into what went on at these institutions.Read MoreMother-and-baby homes branded ‘one of the great scandals of our time’ as public inquiry call madeThousands of women passed through the institutions, where they were forced into “slave labour”, had to give up their babies, and were forcibly detained.Other recommendations from the  include new legislation to secure access to records for survivors and their families and immediate redress payments.Three experts were appointed to the : Professor Phil Scraton of Queen’s University, whose research was key to securing justice for the families of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster Deirdre Mahon of Women and Children’s Services and Dr Maeve O’Rourke of NUI Galway.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Speaking to the Belfast , Marie said she only learnt the truth about what happened to her sister – and that she had a nephew, Mark McCollum –  when he contacted her on social media last year.“I couldn’t believe it, it was like listening to a horror story… I knew right away when I saw Mark, he was my sister’s son, he looked just like her,” she said.“I learned Kathleen was at one of these homes, gave birth, and then a social worker took Mark over the border and Kathleen went to England. At the home Mark was given a new name, new birth certicate, everything. That’s why nobody knew what really happened.“When I heard what went on at these homes, I was horried… eight-and-a-half months pregnant and down on her knees scrubbing floors. Told you were a sin and brought shame on your family. No wonder she went away to England after.“It was awful and my anger to this day would still be very raw. When I saw the pictures of the home she stayed in, in what [looked] like a haunted house to me. The whole thing is a horror story.”Mark spent his le trying to find out who his real mother was, but was hampered by a lack of access to documents and silence from those responsible. When he eventually did find out, Kathleen had already passed away.“When I heard [Phil Scraton] speak today, I was given a bit of hope, and I said to Mark, ‘It’s a new day for you now’. I do have hope, but I just feel so bad, so bad for Kathleen and Mark, they both tried to find each other and they were just up against a brick wall,” Marie said.“Today is a great day for Mark, he has fought so hard for this.

Around a third were under the age of .Professor Scraton said what took place at these institutions was “appalling” and the women and girls who went there have been “denied access to their lives”.The victims and survivors’ pain will never be assuaged… this is one of the great scandals of our time,” he said.How dare we as a society blame those who suffered the most.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadShould I call in twice  BBC’s Nolan criticised by ‘Damian from Londonderry’ over Derry policyNI high street voucher: , applications blockedNorthern Ireland hidden gem is named ‘eccentric hotel of the year’DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson asked for constituent’s Irish quarantine hotel bill to be waived after ‘traumatic’ experienceDerry ice-cream parlour boss apologises for logo’s ‘striking resemblance’ to Parachute Regiment insigniaTop VideosPlayVideo: Flower pot destroyed and eggs thrown at windows overnight in Belfast Holyland areaPlayVideo: Report into mother-and-baby homes releasedPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely Latest Northern Ireland‘Search your conscience’, PSNI detective makes fresh appeal over murder of loyalist dumped at sea  years agoWoman with incurable lung disease put in ward with Covid patients: ‘I feel like I’m being left to die’Neurologist at centre of patient recall removed from medical registerAntrim town man put on probation for disclosing #private sexual# photographsO’Neill to push for public inquiry into mother and baby homesLatest‘Search your conscience’, PSNI detective makes fresh appeal over murder of loyalist dumped at sea  years agoWoman with incurable lung disease put in ward with Covid patients: ‘I feel like I’m being left to die’Greg Wise discusses finally getting to play Bond in upcoming Strictly danceMichael Holding accuses ECB of ‘Western arrogance’ over cancelled Pakistan tourIan Botham questions England’s desire to play ‘ultimate test’ in Australia,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The art of talking is consigned to the s.Dr Sandra Scott-Hayward, a senior lecturer in Queen’s University’s Institute of Electronics, Communications and Information Technology, said the six-hour breakdown was a timely reminder of how vital to our lives internet services have become and how fragile they can be.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Sandra Scott-Hayward, senior lecturer at Queen#s University#s Institute of Electronics, Communications  Information Technology FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDr Sandra Scott-Hayward, senior lecturer at Queen#s University#s Institute of Electronics, Communications  Information Technology“The Facebook outage gives personal and business users of these services an insight into our reliance on communication networks for all aspects of our day-to-day lives,” she said. “Most of the time, we’re oblivious to the background operation of Internet services.“Yesterday, the complexity of running global scale networks was brought to our attention with a “faulty configuration change” effectively disconnecting end users from the Facebook systems. This incident will raise questions for many organisations, not just Facebook.”For a brief moment in time, we were thrust into history. Perhaps  years from now, we’ll be watching a streaming service documentary, a television company making one of those back-in-time programmes. Living in the s. No social media. How did we all cope Perhaps, once a year, we should have an enforced social media holiday. A bank holiday style arrangement where the networks cease for  hours, a little reminder of what’s important in le. A little social contact for real, a visit to a friend for a chat and a coffee, a switch off from the bombardment of bullies, opinions and what other people had for dinner at that posh restaurant we can’t afford to go to.The business community might not agree. Millions of pounds could be lost, such has the importance of social media become.There seems no happy medium in the social media world. Either people cry out for help, or hit us with all that’s good in their lives, making us feel ever so slightly inadequate in our own existence.Perhaps, away from that quagmire, we can simply be content with our own lives for a bit  The reliance on internet facilities, though, means the days of a simpler live those of a certain age remember are no longer with us for more than the time it takes for the technical boffins to find a fix for a system failure,You can bet the first thing most teenagers did was go on to Twitter to complain about Facebook and WhatsApp not working, stare pleadingly at phone screens, tap the screen to seethat helped and try the old favourite, switch off and on to seethat helped. But maybe a step back into real le was the way to go to see how that fitted  Here’s five things we could have done.... Put the phone down and read a book instead.... Took a breath, relaxed and enjoyed the moments of freedom. Gone out, met a friend, or at least made a phone call rather than sending a message. It’s good to talk! Maybe even a newspaper!. Teenagers could have appeared from the undergrowth, back out in the open, away from the lairs of their rooms. Likely coming down the stairs to complain their phone wasn’t working, but at least there could have been interaction.. Offered to make someone a consoling cup of tea.

A legally binding commitment was made by Ireland to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by % by the end of the decade. According to a new sustainability study conducted by Empathy Research in June this year, % of businesses are doubtful theyll achieve these goals. googletag.cmd.push The study also found that % of companies claim they dont have science-based emissions targets, while a further % dont knowtheir targets are science-based or not. This is despite the fact that % of businesses believe their sustainability efforts have positively impacted their bottom line. Commenting on the studys findings, Head of Sustainability at EY, Stephen Prenille, said, Businesses have a very real responsibility to take charge of the role they can play in addressing the global climate change crisis. He continued: [They]need to proactively consider the cost-saving benefits of sustainable practices from the get-go and build them into financial planning. It doesn’t undermine sustainability efforts to draw a connection to long-term profitability, on the contrary, it supports its adoption and longevity.” Forty percent of respondents to the study said they will seek support in the next six to twelve months to help improve sustainability efforts.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

This counted as P.E in the s. Long before the days of groups being brought out rock climbing or kayaking, the kids of the s were walking around the P.E hall trying to balance tiny beanbags on their heads. It never made it past the Olympic sport application, though, but we hold out hope. Teachers really had it handy back in the day! googletag.cmd.push The bin was a social hub... Getting continually chastised for talking in class was the bane of the existence of a s primary school pupil. We found a novel solution, however, as we all bought p pencil pairers and took full advantage of the rule that said pencils had to be paired at the bin and nowhere . The chats were had and many a firm friendship blossomed at the bin in the corner of the classroom. The school tour game was weak... In the s, school tours normally consisted of a trip to a local farm where the farmer was only delighted to welcome  screaming children to his place of work - NOT. We spent most of the day looking at cows and chickens, complaining about the smell, and the highlight of the day was bottle-feeding a baby goat. Those were the days, eh  What we would have given for a day trip to Tayto Park! The Don arrived... Whether it was by chance or design, for some reason on a random day during the s, artist Don Conroy from RTEs The Den turned up and drew an owl. We had to follow his instructions on a piece of copy paper and iniably ended up with a misshapen circle on top of an oval, after which we got distracted and went to the bin for another chat.     Mistakes were made... At one point or another, someone in the class made an absolute mess of the maths problems and proceeded to erase every screed of writing from his her page using a eraser. The smell of burning rubber wafted through the classroom asit was Mondello Park and poor Peters arm never recovered from the repetitive strain injury. What  could he do  Tipp-ex was strictly not allowed! Our books were routinely wallpapered... Covering school books was the order of the day because we all used the schools book lending scheme. You got the books that were used forty years earlier and in order to protect them, your poor mother had to spend the whole evening plastering them in wallpaper. Colours and styles did not matter to your beleaguered mother whatever wallpaper was left over went on, that was that! The telly was rolled in... REJOICE! At school in the s, the telly carried with it a God-like status. There was utter pandemonium when the teacher pushed it into class. The level of reaction could only have been equalledshe had pushed The Backstreet Boys in on a trolley. Absolute scenes! Iniably, the excitement dissipated when a farming or water safety video was produced, which was minus craic, but very important. Nevertheless, that momentary thrill of hearing its wheels squeaking down the hall and emerging through the door was the highlight of our primary school education. We had The News... In the very early years of primary school, we were required to write the news into our copies. The news was far from exciting and usually involved a classmates tooth falling out, trips to the zoo, or other random happenings in our non-eventful lives. In fairness, we were only five! Today is Wednesday...it is a rainy day. Accurate to this day! Ah, the memories! The Shatterproof Ruler Experiment... All of us, at one point or another, splashed out on the p shatterproof ruler from the school shop and conducted our own unofficial experiment to see could we actually shatter it. We proceeded to bend and contort the unsuspecting ruler furiously, our faces grimaced in anticipation of the impending snap. The experiment had mixed results. Some of us lost eyes due to the shrapnel, others were simply left with a bent-out-of-shape ruler in their pencil case with white strain marks down the middle. We had pencil toppers... These normally arrived free in cereal boxes and we upended the box of Corn Flakes in order to be able to go to school with a troll on top of our pencils – the absolute envy of the entire class. Trolls were popular but the toppers came in all shapes and sizes. Hey Arnolds head certainly made an appearance at one stage.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, In this weekends intermediate championship schedule, its all about getting eight teams down to four ahead of the quarter-finals later this month. Limavady v BallymaguiganThursday- OwenbegReferee: Kieran OConnor The first game of this this weekends action is a repeat of last years clash at the same stage when Limavady were convincing winners to knock Ballymaguigan out of the championship.When the sides met in last months group stages, it was a gripping contest won by Sheagh McLaughlins late thunderbolt to the top corner of the Quigan net, as a Cormac Quigley inspired Limavady came out winners again.Ballymaguigan lost out to Lissan and played second fiddle to Steelstowns blue wave in their final game.Daniel Bradley should be back this weekend after missing the game with illness.Michael Spiers made himself an outlet in attack and Shea Bradley battled well at midfield, but they will need another big performance this week.Limavady should have Oran Hartin back between the posts this weekend after John Deighans cameo in the last round. Karl Diamond and Fabian Muldoon will hope that Conor Boyd is fully fit to start after his substitute appearance against Lissan. His bravery, use of the ball and positional sense will bring stability to their defence. Not to mention his experience.Theyll have to keep an eye on Paudie Martin in attack after his three goals in as many games. It will be interesting to seeCiaran McIvor and Darren Conway are included from the start, or kept in reserve for when the game opens up.Limavady won the sweeper battle, with Kieran McGlinchey imposing himself on their counter-attacking game, with Tomaacutes Brady overworked and being the third marker Cormac Quigley went through on the night.Thursday will be about whoever can make the wide open spaces their friend and the Wolfhounds may be better equipped and their goal threat could see them into the last eight.VERDICT: Limavady googletag.cmd.push Glenullin v SlaughtmanusFriday- Celtic ParkReferee: Gregory McWilliams Glenullins inconsistent season arrives at the final fork in the road on Friday night at Owenbeg as Liam Bradleys side put their championship cards of the table. There are no more chances. This is championship as we know it and standing in their way is a Slaughtmanus side they defeatedfive weeks ago in the group stages.The Glens narrow defeat at the hands of Castledawson was followed by a disappointing performance at Faughanvale, a game they never got to grips with.In the absence of Eoin Bradley, their young guns of Fearghal Close and Michael Oacuteg McKeown asked a lot of Castledawsons defence, with Neil McNicholl also a welcome . They will be without Skinner who will be on duty with Coleraine.The Glen have found an excellent keeper in Sean McKinney, behind a defence backboned by the OKanes. Ronan Close, Traglach Bradley and Brian Mullan will provide their midfield spine.Slaughtmanus could again be without Conor McGee, Gavin McShane and Eoghan Cassidy, but the have still been able to create chances. All they need is a day when their threat clicks and the net is bulging rather than another day of regrets and head scratching. Their clash with the Vale wouldve been oh so dferent had they taken even one of their goal chances when they trailed - to -.Goalkeeper Conor Thornton has , but theyll nee to maximise their output from Caolan Hargan and Killian Thornton up front, with Kyle Gallagher pulling the pieces together.A tight game in prospect, with Bakers side to come through.VERDICT: Glenullin Lissan v GlackSaturday– GlenReferee: Dan Mullan Two years ago, Glack were in flying form on their way to the junior title, but have since lost their mojo and have trudged their way though the season in Division .Lissan, while playing in a higher ision, failed to win a game, but they gave plenty of teams trouble. Their one-point defeat early in the season to eventual champions Drumsurn showed the promise they have.Former Derry minor captain Iarlaith Donaghy has been their consisitent cog all season and he kicked four points in their defeat at the hands of Limavady.They will take confidence from their win over Ballymaguigan into Saturdays trip to Glen.Glack have good performances from Ryan OKane, Martin McGonigle, Ryan Morgan and Adam OKane for much of the season. Adrian McGilligans side had the league win over Ballerin, in which they denied the Sarsfields the title, as a sign of they can do. But with too much reliance on Niall McGOwan for scores, it leaves Lissan with a target – stop him and they could repeat their  season and nip a spot in the Quarter-FinalsVERDICT: Lissan     Castledawson v Doire TrasnaSaturday– DungivenReferee: TBCA team we know much about and will be contenders for the biggest prize on offer next month against Doire Trasna who havent got going. Literally.Their two concessions against Greenlough and Drumsurn raised a few eyebrows across the county. Covid, players away at college and injuries combined into their reasoning for not fielding. It leaves them totally undercooked for a game theyd have been facing an uphill battle with even their full compliment of players.Eoghan Quigg, Micheaacutel McNaught and Colin Murray have been their key men in attack in recent times, with Tomaacutes McCrossan their anchor in defence and Paul Quigley at midfield.In recent times their management duo have had to get the boots on and their lack of collective training doesnt bode well ahead or Saturdays encounter.Dawson manager Niall Jackman admits to using the league to blood new players, with the view of drawing up a side later in the season. Players like Niall Rafferty in their defence. And that time is now.They can count themselves unlucky not to get something out of their group game against the Vale at home and they dug deep to see off Glenullin.Theof Niall Keenan has been a welcome addition and Niall McNicholl is in the form of his le, having got himself into great nick. Jackman will have to guard against complacency, but its hard to make a case for anything other than a Castledawson win.

Reporter: Michael McMullan Oct   addthis, In this weekends intermediate championship schedule, its all about getting eight teams down to four ahead of the quarter-finals later this month. Limavady v BallymaguiganThursday- OwenbegReferee: Kieran OConnor The first game of this this weekends action is a repeat of last years clash at the same stage when Limavady were convincing winners to knock Ballymaguigan out of the championship.When the sides met in last months group stages, it was a gripping contest won by Sheagh McLaughlins late thunderbolt to the top corner of the Quigan net, as a Cormac Quigley inspired Limavady came out winners again.Ballymaguigan lost out to Lissan and played second fiddle to Steelstowns blue wave in their final game.Daniel Bradley should be back this weekend after missing the game with illness.Michael Spiers made himself an outlet in attack and Shea Bradley battled well at midfield, but they will need another big performance this week.Limavady should have Oran Hartin back between the posts this weekend after John Deighans cameo in the last round. Karl Diamond and Fabian Muldoon will hope that Conor Boyd is fully fit to start after his substitute appearance against Lissan. His bravery, use of the ball and positional sense will bring stability to their defence. Not to mention his experience.Theyll have to keep an eye on Paudie Martin in attack after his three goals in as many games. It will be interesting to seeCiaran McIvor and Darren Conway are included from the start, or kept in reserve for when the game opens up.Limavady won the sweeper battle, with Kieran McGlinchey imposing himself on their counter-attacking game, with Tomaacutes Brady overworked and being the third marker Cormac Quigley went through on the night.Thursday will be about whoever can make the wide open spaces their friend and the Wolfhounds may be better equipped and their goal threat could see them into the last eight.VERDICT: Limavady googletag.cmd.push Glenullin v SlaughtmanusFriday- Celtic ParkReferee: Gregory McWilliams Glenullins inconsistent season arrives at the final fork in the road on Friday night at Owenbeg as Liam Bradleys side put their championship cards of the table. There are no more chances. This is championship as we know it and standing in their way is a Slaughtmanus side they defeatedfive weeks ago in the group stages.The Glens narrow defeat at the hands of Castledawson was followed by a disappointing performance at Faughanvale, a game they never got to grips with.In the absence of Eoin Bradley, their young guns of Fearghal Close and Michael Oacuteg McKeown asked a lot of Castledawsons defence, with Neil McNicholl also a welcome . They will be without Skinner who will be on duty with Coleraine.The Glen have found an excellent keeper in Sean McKinney, behind a defence backboned by the OKanes. Ronan Close, Traglach Bradley and Brian Mullan will provide their midfield spine.Slaughtmanus could again be without Conor McGee, Gavin McShane and Eoghan Cassidy, but the have still been able to create chances. All they need is a day when their threat clicks and the net is bulging rather than another day of regrets and head scratching. Their clash with the Vale wouldve been oh so dferent had they taken even one of their goal chances when they trailed - to -.Goalkeeper Conor Thornton has , but theyll nee to maximise their output from Caolan Hargan and Killian Thornton up front, with Kyle Gallagher pulling the pieces together.A tight game in prospect, with Bakers side to come through.VERDICT: Glenullin Lissan v GlackSaturday– GlenReferee: Dan Mullan Two years ago, Glack were in flying form on their way to the junior title, but have since lost their mojo and have trudged their way though the season in Division .Lissan, while playing in a higher ision, failed to win a game, but they gave plenty of teams trouble. Their one-point defeat early in the season to eventual champions Drumsurn showed the promise they have.Former Derry minor captain Iarlaith Donaghy has been their consisitent cog all season and he kicked four points in their defeat at the hands of Limavady.They will take confidence from their win over Ballymaguigan into Saturdays trip to Glen.Glack have good performances from Ryan OKane, Martin McGonigle, Ryan Morgan and Adam OKane for much of the season. Adrian McGilligans side had the league win over Ballerin, in which they denied the Sarsfields the title, as a sign of they can do. But with too much reliance on Niall McGOwan for scores, it leaves Lissan with a target – stop him and they could repeat their  season and nip a spot in the Quarter-FinalsVERDICT: Lissan     Castledawson v Doire TrasnaSaturday– DungivenReferee: TBCA team we know much about and will be contenders for the biggest prize on offer next month against Doire Trasna who havent got going. Literally.Their two concessions against Greenlough and Drumsurn raised a few eyebrows across the county. Covid, players away at college and injuries combined into their reasoning for not fielding. It leaves them totally undercooked for a game theyd have been facing an uphill battle with even their full compliment of players.Eoghan Quigg, Micheaacutel McNaught and Colin Murray have been their key men in attack in recent times, with Tomaacutes McCrossan their anchor in defence and Paul Quigley at midfield.In recent times their management duo have had to get the boots on and their lack of collective training doesnt bode well ahead or Saturdays encounter.Dawson manager Niall Jackman admits to using the league to blood new players, with the view of drawing up a side later in the season. Players like Niall Rafferty in their defence. And that time is now.They can count themselves unlucky not to get something out of their group game against the Vale at home and they dug deep to see off Glenullin.Theof Niall Keenan has been a welcome addition and Niall McNicholl is in the form of his le, having got himself into great nick. Jackman will have to guard against complacency, but its hard to make a case for anything other than a Castledawson win.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

In it, Burke accuses Kitson of the following: “Had he set out to become a recruitment sergeant for the IRA, he could not have done a better job”. googletag.cmd.push A cynic might say that such an accusation can only be made in hindsight but voices at the time during the early s were saying it as well. One such voice was Stormont Parliament MP, Paddy Devlin of the SDLP, who wrote that Kitson “did more than any other inidual to sour relations between the Catholic community and the security forces”. Burkes book reveals how the tragic events of Bloody Sunday was not a case, of a few troops being out of control but the culmination of a number of poor, ill-formed decisions that had its roots in the British armys counter-insurgency techniques employed in their then-colonies of Malaya, Kenya and Aden. Such techniques also involved many incidences of torture used by the army – something that would visit Derry and the rest of the north of Ireland when Kitson arrived. The Savile Report of  vindicated the victims and those attending the Civil Rights march on that fateful Sunday in  but neither General Kitson or his elite troops were held accountable. Burke, a Dublin-based barrister who is also the son of Richard Burke – the Education Minister in Liam Cosgraves Fine Gael government, attempts to set the record straight regarding Kitsons involvement and how his tactics during his time in the north of Ireland spiralled into the murder of  civil rights marchers in Derry.     “I tried to write the book in a way thats not overly academic,” said Burke, but there are footnotes there to show my research and to back up what has been written. “It wasnt written for an audience who had not known anything previously about the subject matter but for people who are interested in what happened in the north in  and . “I wrote a book last year, which was called Deception and Lies: The Hidden History of the  Arms Crisis, One of the themes of that book was why The Troubles started. “In that I pointed out that in the mid-s, the IRA had all but laid down their guns. There was a rapprochement opportunity between the government in the Republic of Ireland and the Stormont Government in the North. “That had sparked militant responses from people like Ian Paisley and they had turned up the heat and they had created by  violence and inter-communal fighting. “In that context this book is a continuation of the previous one in that it looks as why did it go wrong, why did you have a situation where British soldiers came and they did a fantastic, really honourable job and they were rightly and correctly welcomed with cups of tea and sandwiches during the so-called honeymoon period. “You can imagine back in  being an  to -year-old soldier and being invited in on Christmas Day to join families. There was a good relationship there. “So this book looks at why all that went wrong. I quote Paddy Devlin in it where hes critical of the IRA – the Provisionals in particular – for turning up the heat. Then there was the rioting which was unfortunately part of the deterioration. And then there was the change of government . “One other factor was the arrived of Kitson and Kitsons career in the colonies had always been about counter-insurgency. He was, as I say in the book, the wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. “In fairness to him, he did try the hearts and minds approach at first but then the Provisional IRA didnt want that co-operation. So very quickly, Kitson reverts to his counter-insurgency technique. Documents from  show that they took the decision to take the war to the IRA. They decided not to try to suppress the violence of the Loyalists – later on, of course, there is collusion with those groups. “All of this is aggrevated by the Ballymurphy Massacre and then of course, Bloody Sunday. My conclusion is that Kitsons heavy-handed tactics and the heavy-handed behaviour of the paratroopers in particular, played into the hands of the IRA.” One such tactic was for Kitson and his staff to rely heavily on accounts given by so-called men-on-the-ground who came off as being in the know but turned out to be fantasists. Observer B was an agent of both British Military Intelligence and MI who had access to the no-go area of Derry back in . This character continually fabricated information that he constantly fed to his handlers – one included the report of an imaginary IRA battalion supposedly conducting a paramilitary drill in practice for a big operation on January , , the day of the Civil Rights march that was brutally ended by Bloody Sunday. Burke continued: “When I looked at Bloody Sunday, it was like being given the parts of a watch and having to put it altogether. I came to the only conclusion I could come to in that Observer Bs information was kept within a very tight circle and it wasnt tested. “Had it been given to the likes of RUC InspectorLagan then maybe he might have been able to point out the inaccuracies of some of Observer Bs ridiculous claims. “But this information from Observer B was going through his handlers who dont know what Derrys like and dont understand it and hes their source of information as theyre not relying on anyone . Its from there a catastrophe begins to unfold and becomes understandable.” The Saville Report has been presented as the final denouement on what happened on Bloody Sunday but Burke says questions still remain to be answered. He added: “Their activities have been hidden from the ordinary person in Britain. Theres a darkness in Whitehall which has a knee-jerk reaction, every time when something like this happens, to cover it up. “Im a barrister and I know thatSaville is entitled to come to the conclusion that the soldiers were out of control. I respectfully disagree with him. I think theres another interpretation of it. “The book points out that there is something much more deeper going on here.” “Kitsons Irish War: Mastermind Of The Dirty War In Ireland” by David Bourke is published by Mercier Press and is out now.

The motion was tabled by Cllr Shaun Harkinwho said that current legislation does not protect all workers who need compassionate leave for a bereavement with some having no guarantee at all of receiving paid leave. googletag.cmd.push Cllr Harkins motion also called for the Council itself to review its own bereavement policy which Councillors voted to undertake. In addressing Council, Cllr Harkin said: “Im calling on this weeks Derry and Strabane Council full meeting to back the Coalition for Bereaved Workers demand and to also incorporate this right to all Council workers. “Currently, Stormonts bereavement policies are harsh. As it stands, there is no automatic guarantee for anyone bereaved of a child, a partner or family member to paid leave. “Its welcome that Stormont is moving towards implementing legislation guaranteeing parents at least two weeks statutory paid leave during this very dficult time. “However, new legislation can and should go further. The Coalition for Bereaved Workers is urging for legislation to be extended to include two weeks paid leave for all people suffering the loss of a partner or family member. “The Coalition for Bereaved Workers is coordinated by the Marie Curie charity and members include Action Mental Health, Alzheimers Society, Carers NI, CIPD , Cruse Bereavement Care, NIPSA and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The Executive shouldnt ignore this powerful coalition of voices.     “Stormont needs to update archaic workers rights legislation to make sure all everyone dealing with bereavement be afforded time to grieve without fear of losing their job or income.” After Councillors had voted for the motion to be passed, Cllr Harkin welcomed the result saying: “I was glad to be able to bring a motion to Council supporting the Coalition for Bereaved Workers demand for at least two weeks statutory leave and pay anyone faced with the loss of partner or family. “The Council unanimously backed the motion calling on Stormont to extend bereavement legislation currently under consideration. “Our Council can also lead on this important issue by implementing humane bereavement policies for our workforce. “Stormonts employment laws are outdated and need a complete overhaul. “Incorporating bereavement leave and pay into legislation can be a step towards creating a more caring society. “I want to commend the efforts of all the groups in the Coalition for Bereaved Workers and everyone who has campaigned for bereavement leave and pay to be put into legislation.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Concern has been growing with the build-up of motor vehicles in the area – especially on Marlborough Terrace, Beechwood Avenue and Laburnum Terrace. Cllr Logue, who represents The Moor ward, says the issue with traffic cannot continue and urged the Department to find a workable solution. googletag.cmd.push She said: “I felt it was important to have this onsite meeting with the Department for Infrastructure to highlight a number of road traffic issues affecting the area. “I have been receiving complaints about the constant gridlock of traffic at peak times of the day on Marlborough Terrace, Beechwood Avenue and Laburnum Terrace, with a particular problem for vehicles exiting and entering the junction at the bottom of Beechwood Avenue. “This is also causing problems for residents being able to park outside their homes, as well as air pollution. After lobbying we got a KEEP CLEAR box installed at the junction back in  but the problem continues. “Just this week residents have once again raised the issue of the introduction of a one-way system around Westland Avenue and Westland Terrace. “It must be nearly two years since a consultation process took place and local people again are asking for something to be done. “Like the residents just around the corner, they are faced with traffic gridlock throughout the day and trying to exit out onto Westland Street. “I have appealed to the Department for Infrastructure to try and find a workable solution to these issues.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan.

Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The news that the Dundalk man has signed a pre-contract agreement with his home town club, after  years away, has been met with great excitement by Derry City fans, with the -year-old agreeing a four-year deal at the Brandywell. googletag.cmd.push Now that excitement is being shared by McEleney, who has also agreed tohome next year, meaning he will reunite with his long-time friend and team mate in red and white. “He’s obviously an amazing player,” he said. “I’ve played with him now for six or seven seasons I think and I know what he’s capable of. It’s an amazing signing for Derry. A lot of credit has to go to Derry and to Ruaidhriand Philipfor getting it over the line. He has been the best probably in the league for two or three years running so hopefully he can continue that form.” The two Derry men have done it all at Dundalk in recent years, but McEleney admits that the two soon-to-be Derry City players have often wondered what it would be like to achieve similar success with the team they grew up with. “We have spoken about it before,” he admitted. “Down there I think we’ve won three league titles and FAI Cups and we’ve been in the Europa League and we’ve always said ‘Imagine doing it for Derry’. I think Mickey has said that it is what he wants to do. “We are Derry men and obviously supporters of the club. I used to go to the Brandywell to watch Derry and I had a season ticket for six years on the run. It won’t be weird, we’re just excited by it and really looking forward to it.”     These are exciting times for Derry City with Ruaidhri Higgins determined to bring success back to the Brandywell, and McEleney is adamant that he wants to be a part of it. “Ruaidhri was a big pull,” he added. “I’ve played long with him and he was my assistant at Dundalk and I know what he’s about. I’m just really looking forward to coming back. Mickey is one of my best mates so we speak about kit all the time and he’s the exact same. We just want to do really well and bring trophies back. We’re not coming up to put our feet up, we’re coming up to win trophies.”  ‘Better team won Meanwhile, City boss Ruaidhri Higgins has admitted that the better team won after watching his team fall to their first defeat in  league games with the - loss at Shamrock Rovers on Friday. City took an early lead through Danny Lafferty, but the champions hit back through goals from lee Grace and Danny Mandriou to claim the three points. “The best team won,” he said. “We got ourselves in front with a really good goal early on, but Rovers got a foothold in the game. We were probably a minute away from getting in at half time and regrouping but they have punished us. “Our players have been brilliant.

The news that the Dundalk man has signed a pre-contract agreement with his home town club, after  years away, has been met with great excitement by Derry City fans, with the -year-old agreeing a four-year deal at the Brandywell. googletag.cmd.push Now that excitement is being shared by McEleney, who has also agreed tohome next year, meaning he will reunite with his long-time friend and team mate in red and white. “He’s obviously an amazing player,” he said. “I’ve played with him now for six or seven seasons I think and I know what he’s capable of. It’s an amazing signing for Derry. A lot of credit has to go to Derry and to Ruaidhriand Philipfor getting it over the line. He has been the best probably in the league for two or three years running so hopefully he can continue that form.” The two Derry men have done it all at Dundalk in recent years, but McEleney admits that the two soon-to-be Derry City players have often wondered what it would be like to achieve similar success with the team they grew up with. “We have spoken about it before,” he admitted. “Down there I think we’ve won three league titles and FAI Cups and we’ve been in the Europa League and we’ve always said ‘Imagine doing it for Derry’. I think Mickey has said that it is what he wants to do. “We are Derry men and obviously supporters of the club. I used to go to the Brandywell to watch Derry and I had a season ticket for six years on the run. It won’t be weird, we’re just excited by it and really looking forward to it.”     These are exciting times for Derry City with Ruaidhri Higgins determined to bring success back to the Brandywell, and McEleney is adamant that he wants to be a part of it. “Ruaidhri was a big pull,” he added. “I’ve played long with him and he was my assistant at Dundalk and I know what he’s about. I’m just really looking forward to coming back. Mickey is one of my best mates so we speak about kit all the time and he’s the exact same. We just want to do really well and bring trophies back. We’re not coming up to put our feet up, we’re coming up to win trophies.”  ‘Better team won Meanwhile, City boss Ruaidhri Higgins has admitted that the better team won after watching his team fall to their first defeat in  league games with the - loss at Shamrock Rovers on Friday. City took an early lead through Danny Lafferty, but the champions hit back through goals from lee Grace and Danny Mandriou to claim the three points. “The best team won,” he said. “We got ourselves in front with a really good goal early on, but Rovers got a foothold in the game. We were probably a minute away from getting in at half time and regrouping but they have punished us. “Our players have been brilliant. They have had a lot of praise and pats on the back and rightly so but I think we didn’t reach the levels that we can get to. In key moments in the game we lacked a wee bit of belief and I think we showed naivety and we got punished for it. “We lost our composure and our first pass when we won the ball back let us down.

No Oil Paintings are a rowdy Americana four piece from Belfast. What am I doing writing about a Belfast band when all I do is slag them normally  They do have some good bands and even some great ones and besides most of the funding was gone before anyone  had filled their application. googletag.cmd.push Where was I  Their mix of folk instrumentation, four-part harmonies and high energy live shows serves to create their own brand of genre bending roots music. The band share and switch lead vocals with each member delivering their own style and strength to the songs they bring to the table. Expect to hear everything from swampy blues rock to straight up-country waltzes. What’d you do during the lockdown  “Most importantly we finished recording our debut album, but when we weren’t focused on that we just tried to keep creative. “We recorded live sessions, performed live streams, made ‘zoom videos’ and set each other writing challenges.” Have you got plans for normality, whatever that is, s  “Release the album out into the world. “ We’ve a few more singles to put out before releasing next year, so we’re concentrating on those and trying to book a tour to coincide with that.” Do you like any local musicians andso, who do you like  “We have loads of incredible friends that are part of the music scene here and there really is too much talent to choose from. We’re all fans of The Bonnevilles, Joshua Burnside, Joel Harkin, Laytha, Dani Larkin - The list could go on forever.”     Are there any valuable people, places, organisations to musicians anymore  “There is a huge lack of infrastructure within the music scene in the North, however the people that are here to help do a fantastic job of it. Help Musicians N.I helped fund a lot of the cost of our album through their ‘Do It Dferently’ fund. Places like the Oh Yeah Centre, The Nerve Centre, and how they influence the younger generations as well as nurture the more experienced performers is a credit to all of them. I think a lot of grass roots venues are incredible throughout the country, but we love The Sunflower Bar and The American they’ve always been good to us - and of course Half Bap Recording Studios where we recorded our album.” How was Stendhal, I’ve seen you there a couple of times now  “We’ve slowly made Stendhal a home from home for ourselves, so it’s always a dream to get up to the farm to play again. August  made it our th time performing in the last six years. We’ve made great friends and amazing memories over that time and will always be there for as long as they’ll have us.” Any misconceptions about the band that you’d like to clear up  “I think a lot of people still have us down as quite a bluegrass   folky band, and over the years we’ve had line-up changes and dferent sounds and styles. I think we’ve settled a lot more now into the Americana Alt-folk genre. “We keep very true to our roots and still write folk songs, but they come with a little more decibel now.” Is the oh yeah of any worth  “Absolutely, the work that Charlotte and the team are doing there is really admirable. We’ve been fortunate to play gigs for them on numerous occasions, most recently at last years ‘Sound of Music’ festival. “They have also helped promote us in the past with their ‘Getting To Know’ series and the ‘Native Music Mart’ they host each year. “Aside from ourselves the work they do with Scratch My Progress, Volume Control, Over The Hill and a long list of other”.Well, that’s me proved wrong. I probably owe them an apology So,the Oh Yeah is so good what’s wrong with Irish music scene  “I think the lack of infrastructure is our only downfall. There is an incredible amount of talent on this island, but we don’t have the private investment needed to be able to export it at the right volume. “Small things that people don’t think about such as tour managers, tour buses, right up to major labels and publishers. “We don’t even have representatives for PRS, MU or PPL.” You can find them at www.nooilpaintings and message them atinfo@nooilpaintings,listen to them at open.spoty artist DAlMAJRiFSuRMgdand soundcloud no-oil-paintings,stalk them at instagram no_oil_paintings and twitter nooilpaintingsand watch them atwww.youtube channel UCmxiPBRaPiDbbJiuA-aqA ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

He is currently renovating a studio on his family land in Donegal, Ireland. He exhibits nationally and internationally, showing at the Dublin Castle, The London Art Fair and the Saatchi Gallery with Cynthia Corbett and the Young Masters Art Prize, the Victoria, and Albert Museum “What is Luxury” with Unknown Fields Division and Toby Smith. Other shows include “GLOBALE: Infosphere” ZKM Museum, Karlsruhe, Germany and Van Abbe-museum, Eindhoven. He was selected to represent Ireland in The Ceramic Context Biennale in Bornholm Art Museum in  He collaborated with Dublin architect Peter Carroll from A architects at The European Culture Centre in Venice May-Nov , participated in the Landmark series with Sky Arts representing Scotland, commissioned by Sky Arts to produce a piece of sculpture in  days. He also has a solo show in Dec-Jan at Stallan-Brand Gallery in Glasgow  Kevin completed a residency at The Irish Culture Centre in Paris in August . Are We Here , a site-based, .-meter-tall sculpture by Kevin Callaghan commissioned by Sky Arts on the occasion of the new series Landmark, explores the notion of utopia and our proximity to it      With an ongoing interest in geometry and the potential for multiple realities, Callaghan invites viewers into a future-minded meditation on hope and potentiality via Are We Here. “Are we here ” It’s a question that suggests we are on a journey, and, in addition to hunger for our destination, conjures hope—hope for real freedom and space to realize our multitude of potentialities. If “here” is not yet utopia, it is at least a space where we might imagine, hope for, and build our future. What local music are you into  “Jonny Delaney, Ryan Vail, Orla, And I got a listen To Kwa Daniels’ new radio show on my way to Belfast airport flying back to Glasgow” Inna Rhythm Apart from the obvious, how have you spent lockdown  “When lockdown started my plans to be in Paris on a residency had clearly changed so I began to work extensively on my brand Condie, so that kept me busy for the first lockdown, The second lockdown was crazy busy, after sky arts asked me to apply for the series Landmark, I was one of  in the UK and Ireland commissioned by them, I set about designing the piece Are We Here with my designer. The built-up to the making of the piece in April was intense, then the piece was made in  days from start to finish with the help of the fabricators Sculpture and Design in Glasgow. there was a slower period in May and June then I was finally off to Paris in July”. What groups or services have helped you  “I have had dferent support over the years, the arts council of Ireland, Business to Arts in Dublin, The Crafts Council of Ireland, The National Sculpture Factory in Cork, Donegal Council, and enterprise board to name a few. Its away a nice feeling to support locally”. How do you feel things will change for musicians in the coming year  “It’s been a really tough time for musicians the last  months. I think it’s still going to be a bit slow for artists to get their regular gigs coming back, but I would hope there will be some great new material coming out, from the complex time you all have just had. And I hope that the younger generation of musicians continue to make and put music out and dont get disheartened by the pandemic”. What are your long-term plans  “My long-term plans are to continue making work for exhibitions and larger commission work. I have been doing it since my time studying in Derry  and I dont intend to stop any time soon. I still like to do a residency somewhere every year, I really want to do one again in China, however, le is pretty busy. I am currently renovating a sheep shed in Barnesmore, Donegal in a new studio on the family land and we plan to develop a Bothy style Glamping site on the land in the near future”.

This is the true story of Bernard Gallagher who became a national celebrity during the early s. Considered Derry’s greatest scammer and conman, Willie John was convicted and jailed more than  times for  pretences, impersonation and theft. Born in  in the Rosemount area of Derry City, Bernard Gallagher moved from place to place in pursuit of money, lodgings, food and drink. He became widely known as ‘Willie John’ when he posed as the long lost son of a widow in his hometown. Eventually it was discovered that Gallagher was in fact not Willie John McGranahan and he served five years in prison for this crime. At a time of widespread poverty and emigration, ‘Willie John’ targeted families in remote areas and his favourite scams involved impersonating a long lost relative and tall tales from overseas. In other elaborate ruses, he took on the guise of an official claiming to bring good news about an inheritance from America. By the early s, his court appearances were sensational affairs with large crowds gathering to catch a glimpse of the infamous ‘Willie John’. He often conducted his own defence, playing to the gallery and sometimes pleading that his case not to be tainted by ‘my former character’. Using newspaper articles from the time, Doacutenall investigates how one man managed to hoax people in Derry, counties Donegal and Tyrone, and further afield in Ireland, Scotland and England. Doacutenall travels to the National Archives in Dublin in search of ‘Willie John’s’ prison records and comes ‘face-to face’ for the first time with the man himself as prison photographs of ‘Willie John’ track his changing appearance as he s again and again to prison over the years. Despite his infamous career and his celebrity status, Doacutenall discovers that ‘Willie John’ spent the last  months of his le in Derry’s poor house and reflects on what drove this man – who made a career out of tricking ordinary people – to act the way he did.Made by Macha Media for BBC Gaeilge, Willie John –RoacutegaireMoacuter Dhoire, airs this evening at:pmonBBC Two Northern Ireland.  googletag.cmd.pushADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaTake a stroll down memory lane from the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Tuesday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the Hope Centre at Cornerstone City Church is Hope Centre team members Ryan Murphy and John Loughury along with Deputy Mayor, Cllr Christopher Jackson.Derry NewsDerry church launches new service in bid to tackle poverty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  David Burkes book reveals how those detained by the army after Bloody Sunday were subjected to beatings from paratroopers Local NewsJust you wait, you pig, we’re going to kick you to death overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry Court: Lyra McKee accused gets bail overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patrick McEleney and Michael Duffy will play at Derry City next season.SportDerry City have signed the best player in Ireland overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at TheBar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Lets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filmingDerry NewsLets do this one last time! - Final season of Derry Girls begins filming overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Straidarron Community Playgroup celebrates th anniversary  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

That being said, it is no wonder that our rural communities may feel isolated from our bigger towns and cities, where investment and opportunities are more obvious.Rural isolation is closer to all of us than we realise exploring this topic brought to light my own childhood memories of growing up in the countryside.While I loved my upbringing, I hadnrsquot considered how it was impacted by the fact that I grew up in a rural area. It was through exploring the topic of rural isolation that I realised the social effects it can have on our youth.My own children are growing up in the countryside as well and I can now see how this may impact them socially they are not playing with friends in the evenings like many would in housing developments and built up areas.They are playing with each other in their own garden, similar to my own experience. While I donrsquot think this is a negative thing for my children, due to the volume of social groups and clubs that they participate in, I am now consciously taking opportunities to expose them to a wider iety of social situations, so they do not feel the potential effects of rural isolation.It is clear to see the effects of rural isolation when just recently at a meeting with Translink, the cutting of rural bus routes and services was brought to light. This is another slap in the face to those living in rural areas without access to their own vehicle, especially when considering the climate crisis.I and my fellow councillors and party colleagues are encouraging constituents to use active travel and public transport.Meanwhile, those exact services are being cut removing the option for active travel. This is not good enough.I have conducted a range of investigative meetings to see how groups and organisations within South Down in particular are taking action to prevent rural isolation.I recently met with Nicholas McCrickard, manager of Co Down Rural Community Network, an organisation crucial in combatting rural isolation in South Down as itrsquos an umbrella body set up and managed by community groups in the area for more than  years.The aim of the organisation is to create an inclusive future where all citizens actively participate in local le which stimulates a vibrant society.Nicholas and his team, with the support of community groups, ensure regular outreach to all of the citizens in the area so that they can enhance their own lives through participation with ious organisations. This stimulation is a sure-fire way to combat rural isolation, but the resources need to be available to ensure no one is left behind.I recently visited the offices of Good Morning Down in Downpatrick mdash another vital service many in our community rely on. It is an organisation which regularly makes telephone calls to those facing isolation for a iety of reasons. These calls are a method of friendship building between volunteers and residents of a wide iety of ages.The youngest volunteer in Good Morning Down is in their late s, while the eldest is in their late s. Nearly  years worth of knowledge and experience will be exchanged through these conversations and I walked away from this meeting, feeling truly touched by the dedication of the staff and volunteers.In addition, having met with Womenrsquos Aid in recent days, fresh in my mind are the stories of the impact that living in a rural setting has on many women who are isolated from much of society.Not having that friendly neighbour close by can impact the severity of abusive relationships. Thankfully, we have organisations such as Womenrsquos Aid who recognise this and work every day with women in these situations, but funding, resourcing and legislation is always an issue.These are only a few of the fantastic initiatives that offer support to those in rural communities, however, there are many who are unaware of their operation.I would like to raise awareness of the services available to our rural constituents, to promote inclusivity and encourage a positive approach to mental health and wellbeing. It is extremely important to raise awareness and encourage our rural communities to stop and think about their mental health and to consider how rural isolation may affect them.I would encourage our rural communities to take time out to improve their mental health, normalise discussion around issues of isolation and avail of local mental health services.It is time that Newry, Mourne and Down Council took responsibility and recognise the vital work local groups within our community do for the residents of our district and remember that ratepayers donrsquot just live in our major towns like Downpatrick, but also in rural areas such as the wider Lecale countryside.There needs to be a serious refocusing on service provision in rural areas and a renewed approach to capital investment. We need to stand up for the safety of our rural communities, and protect them from the effects of isolation.

side.However, Saul now enter the relegation battle and face the possibility of ing to the intermediate ranks that they fought so valiantly to climb out of last year.Joining them in the fight for survival will be Loughinisland who, similarly to their opening round, could not maintain their lead for the full duration of the match as they lost to Mayobridge.The Bridge now face Bredagh in their third round tie, after the Belfast side defeated Castlewellan in their opener but failed to beat Ballyholland to progress to the quarters.Castlewellan will be relieved that their one point victory over Rostrevor at the weekend kept their Championship dreams alive, but they will face stf opposition against Glenn in the qualying round.Also in the depths of relegation are Bryansford, who lost out to Glenn in their opener before they were defeated by Warrenpoint in the second round.In the intermediate action, Liatroim made it two consecutive wins to progress to the quarters after they defeated Darragh Cross by five points.The Cross will now meet Newry Shamrocks via the back door route with nothing other than a win requiredthey are to keep their promotion to the Senior Championship alive.Whereas it was a bitter pill to swallow for Dromara, Bright and St Johnrsquos who all tasted defeat for the second game in a row and now face the dreaded relegation battle.Despite Dromara losing to Saval in their second round, they will feel more disappointed at their opening performance where they should have secured the win over Clann na Banna after leading for long durations of the contest.Simarly, Bright will also be kicking themselves after they blew a nine point lead in their opener against Tullylish before they lost out to St Paulrsquos.St Johnrsquos also had their promotion hopes dashed in heartbreaking fashion after they lost their must-win game against Newry Shamrocks by just one point.In the Junior Championship, Kilclief ensured Teconnaught would remain in the competition for another year after a three point win progressed the red and green side to the next round.Teconnaught lost out to Aughlisnafin in their opener whilst this was Kilcliefrsquos first taste of championship action after they received a bye in the first round.Elsewhere, Ardglass bounced back from their opening round lost to Dundrum with a fantastic win over Aghaderg.All of the quarter-final teams will have to await the results of the next round before their opponents are known..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Musical garden party raises hundreds for local charities  ","story":"THE recent musical

locally as Bennettrsquos bridge mdash with Cllr Lewis saying what happened was ldquoidiotic and void of reason and that defacing the historic bridge demonstrated ldquoovert sectarianism.Cllr Lewis said while police may not be able to identy those responsible, he was told that neighbours can.ldquoThe aspiring republican artists should be thoroughly embarrassed by their actions and I only hope that their parents are reading this article, he declared.ldquoThis part of rural South Down suffered heavily as a direct result of IRA terrorism.

This would help ensure that the centre of Strangford does not become a car park which happens regularly.Cllr Enright thanked residents for their support on the traffic issue in Strangford and confirmed that the Stormont department has accepted the traffic tailbacks causes problems and that the issue needs to be addressed.He said officials have allocated a small budget to employ additional staff to ensure that the dedicated ferry queuing area is utilised at peak periods to reduce congestion in the centre of the village.Cllr Boyle agrees that a permanent solution is required to address the queuing issue in Strangford.He continued: ldquoWe must promote tourism to its fullest potential on both sides of Strangford Lough. That means that we need structures in place that maintain a steady flow of traffic through both Strangford and Portaferry.ldquoWe simply cannot continue with Strangford village regularly coming to a standstill, with residents being seriously affected, creating a negative rather than positive impact on local businesses and le in general due to ferry traffic.Cllr Boyle said Strangford and Portaferry had much to gain from tourism, provided there were proper structures in place to deal with vehicles wishing to board vessels on either side of the lough.He said he has discussed the problem with Cllr Enright and they believe there is a simple, cost-effective solution to addressing the problem.Cllr Boyle said it is important that visitors and tourists have a positive, not negative experience of both villages, confirming that both politicians plan to progress the issue with senior Department for Infrastructure officials.He said they also hope to contact with Stormont Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Wheelchair beach access plan  ","story":"THE possibility of trialling floating wheelchairs at beaches across the district is being considered by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The move comes after the local authority was asked to address the lack of access to beaches for those with mobility problems and officers asked to look at potential solutions.A number of politicians say they recognise the need to do more to ensure beaches can be accessed by a wide range of people by providing floating wheelchairs and special matting to allow them to travel over sand to make it to the water.The issue was discussed at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee with officers agreeing to bring back a report for discussion next month.Initially, officials will examine access to Newcastle beach before focusing on others across the district.Local councillors Patrick Brown and Alan Lewis are spearheading the drive to provide improved beach access, especially as there a number of local facilities which have been awarded prestigious blue flag status which recognises their quality.In a report presented to members of the council committee last week, officers said they were currently investigating several options and a further report will be tabled in October.She also issued a reminder of ongoing consultation on so-called changing places provision which is designed to meet the needs of people with a range of mobility issues.Cllr Harte said not everyone in a wheelchair was mobile and would need a hoist. Therefore there wouldnrsquot be much point providing floating wheelchairsthe council did not have the facilities for these people to get into or access these wheelchairs.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said that the beach access issue had been raised with him throughout the summer and he called for other beaches to be included in the pilot.He said his only concern with the motion would be thata pilot project was being proposed, the councilrsquos blue flag beaches at Tyrella and Cranfield should be considered.ldquoThe experience of wheelchair users to get on to the beach and enjoy that same thrill is a priority and we should be doing whatever we can to facilitate that, he said.ldquoThese floating wheelchairs can be taken into the water and allow people to enjoy the same experiences as everybody , things that are taken for granted.The motion to improve beach access was initially tabled in August and was inspired by the campaigning work of local activist, Naomi Herron, who approached all her local councillors askingsomething could be done to give her better access to the beach.At the time, Cllr Brown said he understood that while a small scale trial of the idea has operated in Cranfield in the past, it was important that this was expanded out into other parts of the district and that he could ldquothink of no better place than Newcastle given the large number of visitors it gets every year.He continued: ldquoAs a council, it is important that we ensure all facilities are open and accessible to all residents. It is right that we look at the issue of beach access, with a view to providing provisions for wheelchair-bound residents and visitors who wish to also enjoy our wonderful coastline.ldquo I donrsquot want this issue to go around in circles with reports, meetings and investigations. It is my hope that from this motion we see action, movement toward making the necessary access points needed to facilitate this initiative. Disabled beach access is a reality in other towns within these islands why not Newcastle.Cllr Lewis said work was needed to ensure the entire district is disabled access friendly, from changing to toilet facilities.He added: ldquoIncreased footfall to Newcastle during the good weather has brought many of these issues to the fore. As councillors, we must challenge ourselves to ensure that our district is accessible and open to all by facilitating the extra provisions needed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12347870.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He been excoriated either for being too much like a traditional unionist or for being weak kneed over the need for a pan-unionism electoral pact.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsThe latter critique, articulated quite forcefully and lucidly by Peter Robinson in this newspaper on Friday, needs further objective examination. Because in a sense any possible pre-election deal between Beattie’s party, Jeffrey Donaldson’s DUP or even Jim Allister and the TUV would be rendered as irrelevant unless a far greater electoral issues is not addressed: turnout.According to recent studies of elections and public attitudes in Northern Ireland it is an objective fact that unionists are more inclined not to vote compared to nationalists.In the University of Liverpool Institute of Irish Studies’ comprehensive -page analysis of the  general election and its aftermath in Northern Ireland that gap was more than ten percentage points. Among those who said they prefer to remain within the UK .% admitted they were “non-voters”. The figure of “non-voters” among those who want to reuny with the rest of Ireland was .%. The overwhelming majority therefore of those not inclined to enter a polling station were unionists.The same study also broke down the percentages of those who didn’t vote by their normal party-political affiliations. The highest group who failed to turn up at the ballot box were those who said they supported the DUP. A whopping .% of DUP supporters said they didn’t vote this time around. This compares to Sinn Fein were only .% of their supporters failed to cast their vote. Perhaps surprisingly the next party to suffer from apathy among its supporters was the Alliance Party where .% Alliance minded citizens didn’t vote either.Other credible public surveys and opinion polls find a consistent dichotomy between strong majority backing across the board for the union and a declining support for the main unionist parties at election time. This cannot just be explained alone by a lack of co-operation between those parties and the shredding of the unionist ticket in ious constituencies, which is caused by too many pro-Union candidates standing. Political apathy of course plays a part especially in working class loyalist districts where all the social indices are negative and where a pervasive sense of hopelessness can take hold in communities. As an outside observer it has always struck me as a bewildering paradox as to why these communities can pour so much energy and time into building bonfires, forming bands, organising mass parades but many of them cannot be galvanised to even get onto the electoral register let alone bother to vote.Yet for many within loyalist areas where political apathy reigns there is also a sense of frustration over who to vote for. One of my closest personal friends who would not turn against meI described him as a true-blue loyalist who wears his unionismnot on his sleeve then at least on his Harrington jacket or parka coat. Although he has numerous nationalist and republican pals, as well as political agnostics like this one, my mate is unapologetic in his love of the Union. And yet he will openly admit that he hasn’t voted for years even though he has turned up at anti-protocol demonstrations and marches of late.When pressed as to why he is allergic to the ballot box, he explains that he has no one to vote for. He responds that the traditional unionist parties repel him given his social liberalism when it comes to issues like gay rights, abortion, mixed marriage etc. This man is under the age of  and his attitudes reflect those of a large proportion of younger pro-Union cohort of the population. They might get out and vote to remain within the UK in any future border poll but at present they are not fired up politically to cast a vote for the parties dedicated to preserving that Union.The haemorrhaging of the unionist vote of course cannot just be put down solely to voters like my liberal minded friend and many like him of his generation. However, the strategistswithin unionism should realise that it is not pacts or pre-election arrangements that will really reverse the trend of a declining vote for their parties. It is the failure to encourage pro-Union supporters especially in some of the staunchest loyalist areas across Northern Ireland to put their X or their ,,s on a ballot paper.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWhile not a great deal is known about the history of the village, there are signs of early occupation in the form of a Bronze Age flint tool and cooking mounds that have been discovered. The name of Bonvilston or Tresimwn dates back to the th century when the Norman lord Simon de Bonville was granted the manor by Robert Fitzhamon, Lord of Glamorgan and he constructed a ringwork castle as added protection for the castles at Dinas Powys and Sully.There are also references to monks being at Bonvilston and in a papal bull which is a public decree or charter issued by the Pope, a grange was mentioned in .When the parish became part of the Cottrell Estate, the last resident of Cottrell House was Mackintosh of Mackintosh from Moy in Scotland who was married to Lady Maud Cavendish. In  she donated the reading room for the male population of the village to learn to read, but it wasnrsquot until  that women were allowed in.At the end of the th century the Bassett family owned the estate and the family lived at Bonvilston House for more than  years. The house passed on through more famous names like Tudor Crawshay, the grandson of the well-known Ironmaster William Crawshay and then into the Brains brewery family. Although the house was demolished in  the lodge still remains.Gathering at Maes-y-Ffynon, which was built between  and  the group followed the bridleway at the far end of the road and walking between green hedges arrived at the busy lane which leads to Pendoylan. Crossing the lane and a stile a superb view opened out in front of them across a newly cropped field. Continuing downhill through a sheep-filled field and over the next stile they spotted two donkeys in the field, one of which looked very near to giving birth!At the bottom of the field a holly hedge was very carefully negotiated in order to enter a beautul garden belonging to Trehedyn House in the tiny hamlet of Tyrsquon y Pwll, said to be the birthplace of the Welsh hymn writer Thomas Williams, who later moved to Llantwit Major and in  built the Bethesda Chapel there.     Making their way through beautul meadows, they arrived at Lanlay Meadows in Peterston-super-Ely, which are owned by the National Trust. This quiet rural area has been farmed for centuries and the land is untouched by fertilisers, the hedges are left untrimmed, with its twisted oaks the area is rich in animal and plant le and forms part of the Ely Valley Site of Special Scientic Interest.A fairly rare plant Monkshood or Wolfsbane, which also has a number of other names, grows along the riverside and the whole plant, especially the root, is poisonous. The lovely orchard in the meadows provided the group with a great place to enjoy their morning refreshment in the increasingly warm sunshine, before backtracking slightly to follow a grassy path to the river which twists and turns its way along the northern edge of the meadows.Joining part of the Valeways Millennium Heritage Trail and following the river with its bends, nooks and crannies, an unmarked path led them through some rough, muddy ground. Then passing through fields whilst being preceded by a large herd of cattle, they exited just below the village of Pendoylan.Following a surprisingly busy road to re-enter fields on their journey to Caer Wigau Isaf, this th century Tudor manor house is Grade II listed and after a pause to admire the stunning stone and brick-work of the many buildings, they carried on through a small wooded area for the climb up to Lillypot Farm, where the fertile land was acquired by the Bonvillersquos in the th century.Climbing up through meadows they stopped for lunch at the base of their last climb whilst drinking in the stunning views across the Ely Valley. Then continuing their climb, at Lillypot Farm they were greeted by a lovely chestnut pony who was very friendly and eager to have his photo taken with them, before descending through fields near to the defensive ringwork of Y Gaer, an oval enclosure defended by a bank and ditch.Following a path bounded by gardens they arrived back at the extremely busy A to pass through the grounds of St Mary the Virgin Church, which dates from Norman times, but was rebuilt by the Victorians in  and only the tower and chancel arch remain of the original church, before ing to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Why did Facebook go down On Tuesday Facebook issued a statement confirming that the cause of the outage was, \"configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers caused issues that interrupted this communication.\"Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were down yesterday due to a power outage.Why did Instagram and WhatsApp go down Instagram and WhatsApp are all owned by Facebook and are run on a shared infrastructure, sotheres one error it impacts everyone.As all of Facebooks services were impacted by the power outage, they went down too.This also included Facebook staff who have reported their employee passes no longer worked and that they were unable to access internal systems.Why did it take so long to fix It took  hours to fix the issue.This was because Facebook staff were locked out of their own systems, with some even unable to access their offices.Facebook’s internal systems are run from a shared infrastructure so it took time for employers to realise what was causing the issue.How many people were affected Downdetector, a website that monitors outages, said there were . million reports from around the world about the issue.However, many people dont report and with more than . billion users, its estimated to have impacted a large part of the world.How much will this cost Facebook Facebook’s share price dropped nearly % on Tuesday with the business website Fortune, estimating it could cost Mark Zuckerberg an estimated bn .Could this happen again Weve been here before!In March  a similar power outage left Facebook down globally for nearly  hours.FacebookInstagram  \"       \"  Most PopularPortadown, Lurgan and Camlough mums relay swim entireof Lough Neagh in  hoursMan to appear in court after pipe bomb attack in Craigavon last DecemberCall to tackle HGV driver crisisWhy is Facebook not working  Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram went down for users yesterday due to major power outageMan arrested after ‘incident’ in CraigavonMost PopularEdenderry Memorial Methodist Church to host Harvest ThanksgivingTributes to Portadown businessman who died suddenlyFour arrested after £k of cannabis found in Co Armagh and Lisburn propertiesABC: Targa rally discussion ongoing Two charged after £k worth of drugs found in Tandragee, Armagh and Lisburn                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsFollow us      "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1632989885154.jpg--top_tips_for_safe_student_accommodation.jpg?163298989300","title":"top tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
