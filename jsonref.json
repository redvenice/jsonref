It\u0027s important to read the instruction on the wipes as some require 30 seconds or need to dry in order to take effect. Secondly, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or longer.

This vale has been at the heart of Thomas Hardy\u0027s Dorset. The site is iconic.Belinda Wingfield Digby added: \u0027This is a most romantic valley reflected in our greatest of writers of the English novel, Thomas Hardy.\u0027It is these paths, up and down the valley that his characters trod, these fields that they walked and thence onwards to the market towns of Casterbridge and Sherton Abbas.\u0027Hardy used the landscape unashamedly to reflect his characters\u0027 lives and fatalistic outcomes. \u0027The Japanese are particular devotees to our famous Dorset writer and tours are arranged just to soak in the landscape that Hardy brought to the notice of the world.\u0027          The proposed area at Stockbridge Farm is in the Blackmore Vale (pictured) - a verdant valley the Victorian author called the \u0027Vale of the Little Dairies\u0027The application has been made by French energy firm Voltalia UK and includes proposals for an electricity substation, transformer stations, site access and internal tracks, landscaping, bioersity measures, security fencing and other infrastructure. Several of the objectors say that although they support renewable energy, this plan is a \u0027step too far\u0027 and called for an alternative brownfield site to be found.They say it would also have a hugely detrimental effect on wildlife and be visible from multiple surrounding listed buildings and footpaths, including the Macmillan Way - a 290-mile footpath from Boston, Lincolnshire, to Abbotsbury, Dorset, that is a popular walking route to raise money for the charity Macmillan Cancer Relief.Some pointed out the planned site\u0027s footprint would be four times the size of the nearby village of Longburton and larger than Vatican City.James Johnsen branded it a \u0027violation of natural justice\u0027, while Graham Spencer said: \u0027To call it a blot on the landscape would be a misnomer - this is a mega-blot, delivering devastation on a massive scale.\u0027         Pictured: Writer Thomas Hardy, whose novels were all set in the south and south west of England in a fictional area called Wessex The Campaign to Protect Rural England is also against the scheme.Research by the Dorset branch of the CPRE found that as of last year the county was on track to reach its targets for renewable energy, without this proposed development.The conservation body added that such eco-projects should ensure \u0027no more than minimal damage is caused by renewable energy installations to Dorset\u0027s exceptional and high value landscape\u0027.The Sherborne and District CPRE has strongly objected saying it \u0027poses unacceptable harm to the landscape, setting of heritage assets and the amenity value of this important part of the Blackmore Vale\u0027. Although the vast majority of letters received by the council have been from people objecting to it, some have backed the scheme.One supporter said the objections were prompted by \u0027a degree of NIMBY-ism\u0027, while another pleaded with the planning committee to make their decision \u0027with young people in mind\u0027.Carol Byrom, chairman of the Dorset Green Party, said: \u0027Following Dorset Council\u0027s declaration of a climate emergency, this application will help to secure a sustainable future for Dorset and help us meet our carbon reduction targets.\u0027The solar farm would generate enough energy to power up to 10,605 UK homes a year and displace circa 11,610 tonnes of carbon dioxide.\u0027David Henshaw said: \u0027I think solar farms are a very legitimate part of the landscape at this critical time.

From automated systems that monitor cashflow, to software that sends out emails, there’s a plethora of online tools available to help small firms growSelf-driving cars, surgery carried out by robots, facial recognition software – the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for the world of work have rarely been out of the headlines in recent years. “Everything we assume about work, jobs, training and education – and being human – is being challenged by exponential scientific and technological progress,” futurist author Gerd Leonhard says. “Humanity will change more in the next 20 years than in the previous 300.”Considering the magnitude and scale of this fourth industrial revolution, it’s understandable that many small business owners feel left behind. Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.This technology is most often used by businesses in three different ways: automating processes (such as timed newsletter sends, or bank account reconciliation), data analysis to gain insights (and then performing tasks such as recommending products to customers), and engaging with the public (via customer service chatbots, for example). Much of this has been made possible by cloud computing (a way of storing data remotely), which has given smart platforms powered by the cloud millions of anonymised users’ data to learn from and adapt accordingly. It’s rapidly accelerated the development of tools that are simple for small business owners to use but highly effective in terms of eliminating repetitive tasks, streamlining operations, and enabling sustainable growth.‘It’s important to have a clear mind’“What beekeepers really like is the 88-million-year-old technology that bees use to do all sorts of smart things, like organise their hives, and produce wax and royal jelly from their bodies,” Dale Gibson, co-founder of Bermondsey Street Bees, says about introducing the art of beekeeping to technology. “The last real technological discovery in beekeeping was in America in 1852.”While respecting that heritage, Gibson has been able to incorporate technological development into his business in a number of ways, since installing his first hives on his London roof in 2007. “I do start off with a proper, gummed up, sticky with honey notebook, where the data is gathered in the field,” he says. “But when I come home, I enter that information into a system on the cloud where my associate beekeeper can look it up.” He’s also working on a pilot programme with the World Bee Project to test remote monitors that track the health of hives, such as their weight. That data is then fed back into a central system, shared by 32,000 beekeepers across more than 150 countries. The project hopes this information will help to create more sustainable ecosystems and improve global food security.Gibson is also exploring the potential of tracking his honey via a blockchain system, first trialled by the technology company Oracle at the 2019 OpenWorld show in Dubai. “Anything that can help us distinguish between real, raw local honey and the manufactured commodity that’s come from halfway around the world and been blended, heated and mashed up, then that’s a good thing,” says Gibson, adding that honey is the third most tampered with product in the world, after milk and olive oil.While technology can sometimes be daunting for SME owners to incorporate, he says it’s given him more time to focus on the bees. “We’re massively assisted by having Xero on our phones too so we can use it for inventory record keeping, invoicing and statements at any time and anywhere,” he says. He finds the automatic reminders to customers that an invoice is due (or late) particularly helpful, as is the functionality that automatically reconciles his bank statements. “Even though you’re running a small business and lots of things can happen, it’s really important to have a clear mind.”‘We’re trying very hard to make online successful’Since starting in 2011, Papersmiths has grown from a two-employee interior design studio in Bridport, to launching an additional chain of five stationary shops. The company now employs 25 staff and has a presence in some of the UK’s most desirable retail locations (including Bristol, Brighton, and Chelsea in London).Smart technology has played a clear role in the business’s growth, co-founder Sidonie Warren says. The majority of their data is tracked using point-of-sale software Vend, which integrates with Xero. “That’s excellent because it allows us to track what we’re selling, right down to a specific product or colour,” says Warren. “When we open a new store we use that data to figure out what it is we need to buy, and also planning the fit out of the store.” Shop managers also use it to identify that week’s top five products, and arrange displays accordingly.Building the e-commerce arm of the business has been a key focus for Warren recently. “Our challenge is translating that thing of testing a pen or feeling the paper of a notebook into the digital realm,” she says. Automating email sends via Mailchimp has enabled her to engage new customers via discount codes, and she can target people known to be top spenders at certain times of the year using sales data from Shopify.She uses Xero weekly to plan cashflow, as well as process payroll and track all of her staff expenses. She still uses the personal touch – if a customer is late paying an invoice for example, she’d rather call than send an automatic reminder – but is open to integrating new technology in the future, including an online customer service chatbot, and some sort of retail mapping system. “With online you can see how many times a product gets viewed but it’s very hard to do that in store,” she adds.‘We’ve grown substantially and it’s all down to being in control of our finances’Richard Fishenden worked as a farrier fitting horseshoes before he started Made by the Forge in 2006. “My wife went into a local shop that sold curtain poles and I was horrified at the prices. I said bollocks to that, I’m going to make them myself,” he says. The range has since extended beyond bespoke curtain poles, to other wrought iron homeware items.Fishenden says he used to be “archaic with technology”, but has managed to automate processes in various areas. “Xero seems to be the central part of the spider’s web that everything else feeds from,” he says. That includes an order system, where delivery notes and worksheets are generated so staff know what products to make a customer relationship management system for customer data that Fishenden uses to send quotes via Xero, and then follow up on leads that were once buried in paperwork and Receipt Bank for invoices and receipts that he says has saved hours of data inputting.Sign up to Xero here with a free trial"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bebbb0fc289e6a0d98863661e60707d7f997a2d/0_422_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=182e960f5db24a305d326c6fab7d4ea6","title":"coronavirus epidemic decade austerity public services","story":"Blame Boris Johnson for almost everything, but not for the arrival of the coronavirus. He puts on his serious face, slightly unrumples his hair and tells people to wash their hands. As no one voted for him for public health advice he would do well to let untrusted politicians opine as little as possible, leaving public announcements to the respected chief scientific officer and chief medical officer.But there is no way of keeping politics out of this. If this epidemic is only half as bad as the official worst-case scenario, the pressure on every aspect of public services will be tested to breaking point. The full effect of a decade of austerity is about to be brutally exposed.Until now, the Tories have won and won again, despite the deepest austerity – confident that most people, most of the time, know nothing of cuts in public services they aren’t using now or can’t see. Though the A\u0026ampE crisis is never off our TV screens, the remainder stays below most voters’ radar. But this virus may expose the true state of the country for all to see.Tim Cook, an ICU doctor, writing in the , gave a graphic picture of the lack of intensive care and critical care beds – Britain ranking 23rd out of 31 countries for provision, and almost bottom for the number of hospital beds overall. But what of every other service?Local authorities have the lead role in public health emergencies: they do disaster rehearsals for imaginary terror or biohazard attacks, coordinating with the army for emergency tents and temporary morgues, says Tony Travers, professor of government at the LSE. But coronavirus would probably be a crisis in every council simultaneously, with each being unable to call on help from the others. Over the past decade councils have lost between a third and a half of their income, with a quarter of their staff gone and up to a half lost in some places. Already the flooding has left those local authorities warning they haven’t got the money to cope.Councils’ incapacity was exposed, Travers says, over the Grenfell tragedy. Kensington and Chelsea was not exceptionally badly run, but it could not cope with rehousing and supporting its residents after the tower block calamity: a team of chief executives from other local authorities had to come in and take over. The council on its own had lost too much administrative capacity. Councils run most services, and most, such as environmental health, have been hugely depleted: the National Audit Office describes that service as “failing”.That civic incapacity will be revealed time and again by a coronavirus outbreak, with Whitehall’s civil service reduced to its smallest size in decades: look at the panic-hiring just announced to manage the Brexit customs fallout. If, as government plans suggest, one in five staff are out of action, the care sector will be hit hardest and fastest, as it is already so fragile and understaffed. That puts at risk the lives of old people at home alone or in care homes unable to care, with day centres mostly closed down in the cuts.Money will need to flow fast to stop some care homes going bust and to hire emergency staff from agencies, no doubt at higher rates. Children’s homes face the same crisis, with many more children in care than a decade ago: social work departments are already overstretched. As for understaffed prisons, the prospect of virus outbreaks there and many staff off sick is frightening.A spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care said yesterday, somewhat over-reassuringly: “The UK is extremely well prepared for these types of outbreaks and Public Health England has issued tailored guidance for care providers setting out action to be taken in a variety of circumstances.” Public Health England does indeed inspire trust in its advice and oversight, but boots on the ground and helping hands are provided locally, and councils have taken the heaviest hit in the great austerity. Ever since George Osborne’s first budget in 2010, the plan was to “devolve the axe” to them. The Local Government Association this week warns they have lost £15bn.The government is trying to recruit the 20,000 police it cut, but this takes time. Call in the army, says the emergency plan, but it’s now at its smallest ever, down to 73,000 from 103,000 in 2003. Even if there are no food panics requiring police or army at supermarket checkouts for rationing, emergency services are already planning to triage what they can provide with tough restrictions on their services.In our book, The Lost Decade 2010-2020, David Walker and I have chronicled this unprecedented decline. The Tories have escaped electoral censure for austerity – so far. Perhaps, with luck, the virus will pass over without putting the country to the test. But if it is an epidemic on the scale Public Health England warns of, the politicians who have left the country so defenceless can expect trouble. Voters will be shocked to discover how far the things they took for granted have been depleted and that the government may no longer be able to keep its citizens safe.• Polly Toynbee is a  columnist.

Rather than resurrect the Flybe model, the UK government should confront the problems of rural disinvestment and an ailing transport network. The collapse of Flybe offers an opportunity to think through what a genuine regional transport policy would look like.Before the deregulation of air transport in 1986, the government subsidised domestic flights that provided vital links for remote communities. Flybe began its life in this subsidised market (it was founded as Jersey European Airways in 1979). Few airlines now benefit from such government support. The Scottish government still subsidises roughly a dozen routes to and from Scottish islands, where there is genuinely little alternative to flying.But neither Conservative nor Labour governments have shown much appetite in recent years for resurrecting the airline subsidy model. The Tories’ 2018 aviation strategy document noted that the results of government intervention in regional flights have been “mixed” – and have often been poor value for money due to low demand. There’s no good justification for funding a form of transport that is both environmentally damaging and only used by a small minority of the population.The reason that some have chosen to fly across the UK is because of the inadequacies and high costs of our rail network, placing many communities at the mercy of a commercial airline. CrossCountry, the rail franchise that runs many of the services between towns and cities also connected by Flybe, has long been a Cinderella service with poor punctuality and massive overcrowding on several major routes. Improving these CrossCountry routes should be a priority for the government, which is currently reviewing the structure of the railways in its long overdue Williams review.In the longer term, a more radical approach is needed. Take the example of Switzerland, where every community is guaranteed a service to the nearest major town, with a frequency determined by its size. A large suburb may get a transport connection every 10 minutes, irrespective of whether it is a bus, tram or train, while a distant village might just get an hourly service.The collapse of Flybe should be an opportunity to reflect upon the failures of the UK’s transport system, and start thinking about an alternative. Currently, Labour supports HS2 and has called for reversing the 1965 Beeching cuts, which drastically cut railway lines across the country. This is a patchwork approach that may benefit a few lucky communities but does little for the majority of people living outside of major cities.The government should instead establish a regional transport fund, to which towns with poor connections could apply. This could be used to provide extra train services on existing lines for major cities, improve bus services and create better connectivity within and between communities. It could also be used to rebuild local railway lines and reconnect regional areas.What the country needs isn’t another Flybe or a random scattering of subsidies for the sake of political expediency, but a strategy oriented towards genuine local transport needs, the environment and the economy.• Christian Wolmar is a writer and broadcaster specialising in transport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446585d677c2219a8d70430c60980cefd956868b/0_0_3160_1897/master/3160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56ca50c8bcd3ac4424a708892dc291d9","title":"palestinian voters israel benjamin netanyahu joint list party","story":"Palestinians flocked to the Joint List party and denied the prime minister a majority. Now they could even help oust himThis election, the third in a year, was supposed to finally deliver Benjamin Netanyahu’s victory. His party, Likud, ran a relentlessly dirty campaign, which even Israel’s president, Reuven Rivlin, described as “awful and grubby”. Against the backdrop of his impending corruption charges, Netanyahu’s hope was that higher voter turnout would give Likud a majority.But the election failed to deliver. Netanyahu and the parties loyal to him secured 58 out of 120 Knesset seats, three seats short of a majority. Third time unlucky, Netanyahu has, once again, been stopped in his tracks.Palestinian voters were motivated by a real sense of urgency. Netanyahu’s racist incitement against them has escalated in recent years. In November he described them as an existential threat for Israel. The Trump “peace plan”, endorsed by Netanyahu, called for the transfer of many Palestinian citizens to the future Palestinian “state”. The alarming prospect of being deprived of their citizenship, and forcibly removed to a fragmented Bantustan-style statelet in the West Bank, drove many to the polling booths.No less important was the bold leadership of Ayman Odeh, head of the Joint List. Odeh led a compelling campaign for Palestinian civic empowerment while challenging the Jewish-Israeli mainstream to think of a common political future. In September, the Joint List made shockwaves with its decision to endorse Benny Gantz – the leader of the centrist Blue and White – as candidate for prime minister. Gantz is a former chief of staff, who had previously boasted of bombing Gaza “back to the stone age”. For Palestinian citizens, endorsing such a candidate comes with enormous difficulties. But as Odeh emphasised, this was the lesser evil, compared with the danger of a Netanyahu government, the prospect of immediate annexation of the West Bank, and continued racism against Palestinian citizens inside Israel.The Joint List’s overture articulated Palestinian citizens’ demands for meaningful participation in Israeli political life as equal citizens. In Israel’s 72 years of existence, no Palestinian party has ever been in government. The only slight deviation to this rule came during Yitzhak Rabin’s 1992-95 government, which, during the height of the Oslo negotiations, had a “confidence and supply” agreement with two Palestinian parties. Rabin’s willingness to rely on Palestinian members of Knesset was decried by the right wing, who regularly slammed his government as illegitimate as it lacked a “Jewish majority”. Many believe it was this alliance with Palestinian citizens that led to Rabin’s murder by a Jewish extremist in 1995.The refusal to strike an alliance with Palestinian citizens remains the primary reason for the failure of the centre-left parties to reach power. It is clear that centre-left parties cannot form a government without Palestinian support but these parties have resisted coming to terms with this reality. The racist logic of a “Jewish majority” still forms the basis of mainstream politics. As recently as last month, Blue and White pledged not to include the Joint List in its future government, despite its endorsement of Gantz. Some members of Blue and White are ideologically opposed to the inclusion of Palestinians others are fearful that it would drive Jewish voters away.Blue and White’s reluctance to form such an alliance is not surprising. In many ways, the party is a reincarnation of the Israeli Labour party of the 1970s and 1980s, before Rabin and the Oslo process. It is led by three former top generals, and while pragmatic in some terms, it is hawkish when it comes to relations with Palestinians. Blue and White has endorsed the Trump plan, and with some caveats, the annexation plans. It avoids mentioning the two-state solution.In the past two decades, Israeli public opinion has shifted clearly to the right. With the demise of the two-state solution, Israel’s ethnocentrist character is deepening. The 2018 “nation state” law declared that Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people exclusively. Under the Trump plan, Israel is expected to formalise its de facto annexation of the West Bank, and consolidate the constitutional structures of exclusion and discrimination of Palestinians.Under such conditions, the Joint List’s success over the past year stands out. Its ability to articulate a vision of equal citizenship has had an effect on Jewish Israeli public opinion. More Jewish Israelis advocate the inclusion of Palestinians in the ruling coalition. The number of Jewish Israelis voting for the Joint List, while still very small, increased dramatically in the last election.We are now back at square one. Netanyahu cannot form a government. He is now escalating his rhetoric against the Joint List, arguing that Palestinians should be excluded altogether from decision-making over government formation that their votes in the Knesset should not count. Will the Blue and White opposition abandon this racist logic of a “Jewish majority”, and form an alliance with the Joint List in order to oust Netanyahu? This remains to be seen. The stakes could not be higher, not only for Netanyahu personally, but for Israel’s future: whether it will continue its slide towards a “democracy” for Jews only, or instead choose a path that could lead to meaningful equal citizenship and democracy.• Yair Wallach is a senior lecturer in Israeli studies and head of the Centre for Jewish Studies at SOAS, the University of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c187ec01cc8da11d9764ab93d4e7bd8a6aa403c/0_146_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=838924c584515cd7cc0a4f0be22e66d3","title":"science fiction life locked down chinese city beihai coronavirus","story":"It all starts so quickly. On 24 January I am on my way to one of the big local state schools to run my regular football coaching session. Halfway there, I get a message on my phone telling me not to come.All the schools and nurseries have been ordered to close immediately in response to the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan. Beihai, the small coastal city where I live, is more than 700 miles away and nobody here thought the implications of the virus were going to affect everyone in China.I read that the British government is advising all UK nationals to leave China – not just those in Wuhan. I am shocked. I have lived in the Guangxi province of China for the last five years and have mainly spent that time teaching, including a year as a lecturer in journalism and broadcasting at Guangxi university in Nanning. I have no intention of leaving, I’ve got friends here.The Covid-19 virus seems to be almost out of control in Wuhan and Hubei province, but here in Beihai not so. Yet the reaction to the outbreak has transformed the city and the suburbs into a ghost town. Everyone has been told to stay indoors. Everywhere feels grim and desolate. The big palm-tree-lined roads that criss-cross the city are virtually empty. The streets, usually bustling with locals and tourists, are the same – empty. Nearly every shop, restaurant, business, office and the three main shopping centres are all shut. All the hundreds of small lock-up shops selling everything from bottled water and fruit to computer parts and floor mops, all have their shutters closed. It feels like being in a science fiction film – some alien force has spirited away nearly everyone and only I remain … at this moment with three other bemused locals, curiously looking to see if McDonald’s is still open in the big square. Of course not. Only to order online.It has become unusual to see anyone without a mask, although they have been very difficult to obtain. Every pharmacy sold out of its small supply within hours of the emergency restrictions coming into force. Luckily a doctor friend of mine gave me some. Some people ordered masks online but they never arrived. The postal service has been badly affected.It’s not total lockdown here yet, like it is in Wuhan, but it feels that way. Local government cars with loudspeakers pass by regularly now during the day, issuing warnings, and orders to obey the new restrictions. Only one person from each family is allowed out of their home every two days, to buy food or medicine. Anyone from Wuhan is told to report to the local police department, with threats of prosecution if they fail to do so. There are now roadblocks and checkpoints everywhere, demanding your name, address, ID or passport number. Contact details are written down by officials and your temperature checked – on leaving the area and on your return.Beihai is popular with tourists, especially from the north of China. They have also bought holiday apartments locally, where they spend the winter period, to escape the cold weather back home. I hear that some people from Wuhan are in Beihai and have tested positive. It’s reported that there are 43 confirmed cases of the virus in Beihai. There has been one death an 80-year-old man. All the cases are attributed to people from Wuhan and those who had visited Hubei province but had returned before the lockdown there.The general feeling of a state of emergency is starting to hit home. There are officials and red posters everywhere – warning of the dangers of the virus and details of the emergency restrictions. Now everyone is required to download a new government app on their phone, and register all their contact and ID details. Without the app, you are not allowed to go out.Reaching the roadblock, the official scans my app. This not only keeps track of everyone’s location but also stores people’s details on government computers. I go to RT Mart, the main supermarket, which is open. Operating hours have been limited although there seems to be plenty of stock. The place is virtually empty – all staff are wearing long thin plastic coats, goggles, paper hats and, of course, masks. The atmosphere is surreal.I find out that friends and families are lending each other money to get by because they can’t work. As I’m a part-time teacher, I’m not getting paid by the school. As the crisis continues, many small businesses might never reopen again as rates and rents cannot be paid. My favourite Chinese pizza restaurant has shut permanently. The owner told me he’d spent the equivalent of £15,000 refurbishing the place just six months ago.The government has now banned the sale of wild animal meat at markets such as the one in Wuhan. But can the ban be really enforced? The sheer size of China and its population throws up so many challenges.My Chinese friends say they are embarrassed and angry at how the virus happened and how it has spread. It’s hoped schools will reopen in two weeks and I can go back to work. But there’s no official news yet. The current number of confirmed cases has not increased here: still 43 and one death.Even if I wanted to come back to the UK I can’t because the flights are too expensive, and my biggest fear is contracting Covid-19 while I’m travelling.• Mark Bishop is a lecturer in journalism and broadcasting at Guangxi University in Nanning"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff23b9316f04e2d416081c05eb8a35b64a5b47a0/27_9_4959_2975/master/4959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f30cbc2caf4e7b4d4adc9f95d084e5b3","title":"european critics on uk culture this is europe","story":"Phoebe Waller-Bridge talked sex. Ken Loach exposed class. Amy Winehouse hit listeners in the heart. After Brexit, does British culture still inspire the same affection abroad? Europe’s leading critics give their thoughtsBack in the late 90s, when I lived in London, the UK was in the EU, Tony Blair had led Labour to a landslide win, rave music was roaring out of clubs, in-yer-face theatre was all the rage, the National Theatre had a bias for the classics and standing ovations were a rarity.Much has changed two decades on. When I saw five shows in London last week, I realised there had been some major unheralded shifts in the key themes of contemporary English playwriting, which now mainly focus on British identity post-Brexit.Death of England, by Clint Dyer and Roy Williams, is a relentlessly pungent new play about mourning and identity, seen from an inidual and a national perspective. “Let’s face some facts: we are shit, we are shit at everything! Because England now is nothing but an island of shit,” declares Michael, the play’s sole character.It’s in-yer-face theatre meets Pinter in an exploration of angry nationalism and inner turbulence thanks to Rafe Spall’s demonic, blusterous delivery. It was bold of Rufus Norris to produce such an explosively provocative play at the National, but this seems to be exactly the kind of theatre audiences crave now: political plays that speak out the truth for people who feel they have been abandoned by their leaders plays that put up a mirror for the audiences to look into and engage in some courageous self-reflection.Death of England reminds me of an astonishing new Greek play called Sleep, Stella, Sleep, directed and written by cinematographer Yannis Economides. It poignantly delineates the deformities and malfunctions of Greek society that led to the crisis ravaging the country for more than a decade. Focusing on the dismantled bonds among family members and the dominance of a beastly patriarchal figure, Economides’s play, like Death of England, sheds light on the ailing cell of the family, which contaminates its iniduals and, in turn, society.From the Garden of Eden to Chekhov’s Cherry Orchard, gardens allude to life, nations or the state of being. In Mike Bartlett’s play Albion, the garden is a clear metaphor for England itself. Audrey (a dazzling Victoria Hamilton) is keen on regenerating a neglected green space in rural England. “This is a major project of national importance,” Audrey admits, only to realise a few months later that “there are some things that can’t be restored”. It’s the gardener of the estate, the withering Matthew – impeccably portrayed by Geoffrey Freshwater – who insists on delivering the final line of the play: “A rose. We have to keep it.” Is it a metaphor for England, cut off from the garden of the European Union and destined to dry up and perish? The Greek equivalent to Albion is a new robust work called Agrios Sporos (Wild Seed) by Giannis Tsiros. The wild seed of the title is a palpable metaphor for the pre- and post-crisis Greek who can develop roots in every single “soil” and survive against all odds. As in Athens, the name of the game in London theatres in 2020 is ersity. In London you can opt for a West End musical such as the feelgood show Everybody’s Talking About Jamie, or Temi Wilkey’s jolly family drama The High Table, in which two British Nigerian women decide to get married and invoke their ancestral spirits to bless their union. If somebody wishes to encounter an all-British theatre experience, Witness for the Prosecution by Agatha Christie is the show to choose. Where once it was politicians who faced each other across the imposing chamber of London’s County Hall, now it is QCs Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Myers who battle against each other to prove the innocence or guilt of Leonard Vole.In Athens, you can choose among several courtroom dramas, including the immaculately structured 12 Angry Men at the Alkmini and the interactive Terror at Athinon – where the audience functions as the jury. If you look for the equivalent of Jamie Lloyd’s auspiciously deconstructed Cyrano de Bergerac in Athens, head for the Swedish classic The Father at the Apothiki, awesomely reimagined by director Vassilis Bisbikis.In Athens there are 1,500 shows to choose from, with tickets priced from €10 to €25, whereas in London tickets range from £20 to £200. More and more shows in Athenian venues are played with English subtitles but unlike the British habit of eating and drinking during the show, food and drinks are not allowed in Greek theatre venues while the show is on. What’s the difference between a British comedy critic and a French one? The latter was out of professional luck long before the decline of newspapers. Writing about comedy isn’t really a job description in France, where the popularity of standup is very much a 21st-century thing. Before the mid-2000s, French comedians mostly favoured character-driven vignettes, led by prominent impersonators as well as such troupes as 1980s favourites Les Inconnus and Les Nuls.Even the recent boom of English-style standup in France hasn’t led to renewed critical examination of the genre, which tends to be seen in highbrow circles as just a bit of fun. So when the , in an effort to promote the free movement of banter, looked for a French critic to weigh in on British standup specials, they settled on me – a theatre writer whose main claim to comedy expertise is many a Christmas spent watching the beloved 1979 play-turned-film Santa Claus Is a Stinker, a French classic that involves a character being chopped to pieces in the bathroom of a depression helpline’s offices.While I’m told the British comedy scene is in rude health, not much of it has reached France since Monty Python and Mr Bean. I’ll admit the only active British comedian that came to mind was John Oliver, and he has been based in the US since the mid-00s. In my defence, there are practical hurdles for French viewers hoping to hone some British-style quips. Netflix France only offers a small number of the specials available to watch in the UK many specials turned out to have been produced by the BBC, whose programmes are notoriously hard to access from abroad.As a result, while American comedians such as Amy Schumer and Ali Wong are now fixtures on Netflix’s list of suggestions for French subscribers, few viewers are likely to come across Bridget Christie or Gina Yashere. It’s a shame, because a week’s exposure to them and some of their peers left me wanting more. There is a craft to British comedy that speaks to its longer history, and to the competition standups presumably face to make their mark on a crowded scene. Most routines were impressively paced, building on the natural rhythm of British speech French intonation, which is much more even, doesn’t quite allow for the same musical variations.If you’d asked me beforehand to come up with a police sketch of a British comedian, it would have looked a lot like James Acaster, whose Netflix-produced Repertoire is available in France. He is lanky and self-deprecating, and the storylines holding these four shows together would be too surreal for most French comedians.Starting a performance on his knees? Pretending to be an undercover cop posing as a comic? Spinning an entire hour out of jury duty on a murder case? It’s masterful storytelling in addition to absurd fun, and clever enough to satisfy the most intellectual audience. Even his quip that he loves French cuisine and “that’s why this story takes place in a Pret a Manger” works in France now, since Pret has taken over the Paris high street.The level of deprecation I saw is fascinating from a French perspective because, as a country, we’re just not very good at taking the piss out of ourselves. Many local comedians are masters of the humblebrag, as a way to come out of a vulnerable moment and still look cool. They wouldn’t be caught dead as Sarah Millican’s adventurous sex-averse persona in Thoroughly Modern Millican, yet her warm, mischievous relationship with her audiences is a joy to follow. Her Geordie accent has a sing-song unpretentiousness that is also easier to latch on to as a foreigner than, say, John Bishop’s Scouse, which left me puzzling over some jokes.While French humour tends to be more risque (if you don’t know what that means, just watch Blanche Gardin on Netflix), there is much to love in the unabashed progressiveness of a number of British standups. Christie pulls no punches in Stand Up for Her, and her feminist observations hit home, from her take on Adam and Eve to a skit about an audition for a yoghurt advert that involved a man waiting for a woman inside her fridge. Yashere’s bluntness – whether she is describing her snoring or asserting that “we all see colour, otherwise we’d all be walking around dressed like clowns” – is a core part of her appeal. They understand that taking a clear stand doesn’t have to spoil the fun – a notion that France is still grappling with.The cities we Berlin teens wanted to live in were always British: London, Manchester, Bristol – those were the places our favourite bands came from. At the end of the 90s – before the no-frills airlines started – I finally made it to London thanks to a school exchange program. We rode around in the signature red buses looking for record stores and indie clubs, although we had barely any money and everything was incredibly expensive. As teenagers, we took every flyer and free magazine we could get our hands on and brought it home to decorate our bedroom walls, because we loved British music.Almost all Germans did. It all started with the Beatles – the Hamburgers fell in love with them and the whole Bundesrepublik followed. Even in East Germany, where I grew up, two Beatles albums were released, and it felt as if every GDR citizen had them in their tiny record collection. Today, every music magazine and all the so-called experts still rate them as the best band ever.From the Beatles onward, Britain heavily influenced musical development in Germany. Punk in the late 70s, postpunk and new wave in the 80s, trip-hop in the 90s: it all washed in from the UK. Finally, there was Britpop. Round here there was no such thing as fan fights over Blur v Oasis – if you were in to Oasis you also liked Blur, because it was the same genre. In hindsight, it seems like almost every British band in the 90s was cool, just because they were British: Pulp, the Verve, Manic Street Preachers, Supergrass, Suede.These days are hard times for old Britpop fans. Some journalists (including from the ) blame Britpop for Brexit, arguing that it flew the national flag for nostalgia. Without question, some of our British musical heroes have fallen, the most famous being Morrissey. We all loved him. Farin Urlaub, singer with punk band Die Ärzte, even dedicated a famous song – Sumisu – to him that translated as: “Whenever we were sad – and we were sad pretty often – we went home and listened to the Smiths.”The song describes the relationship between teenagers in the 80s and Morrissey. We were sure he was left-wing, just like us – so he alarmed fans with what he said in an interview with Der Spiegel two years ago: “If you try to make everything multicultural, you will not have any culture in the end,” and “I feel sad that Germany has become the rape capital of Europe … it coincides with the open borders and the free flow.” We were like: WTF? Aren’t open borders and multicultural movements a gain for every music scene, and for culture above all?Disappointed and in disagreement, we needed other bands to listen to. Although we aren’t sad any more, we’re often angry, and who can we turn to? The UK. British rap is much more political than most German hip-hop, which is also angry, but often in a sexist or racist way. By contrast, Nothing Great About Britain by Slowthai is an album that deals with Brexit and nationalism with intelligence, humour and aggression. And there is Dave, who just called Boris Johnson a racist at the Brit awards. Or Kate Tempest who sings: “Europe is lost, America lost, London lost  Still we are clamouring victory”. There are exciting punk bands such as Idles, or bands that defy genre, such as the great Sleaford Mods. They are all admired.Even though there are still British superstars such as Adele, Ed Sheeran or Amy Winehouse (always in our hearts!), there is no such thing as “British music” any more. These days it doesn’t matter where musicians come from. You love them because of their image, their quirks, their personality and of course their music, but none of this is bound to a national style or character. That is no Brexit-related phenomenon – it is a global development. Thanks to the internet you have access to billions of songs and artists. Music is on your phone, your laptop, everywhere you want. And it could be from any country.So London isn’t the place of our dreams any more. It’s too expensive, too boring, too fancy, too sleek. Today, in cities around the world – even in gentrified Berlin – we find clubs that are more exciting and gigs that are more mind-blowing. Maybe because by now, many international and multicultural artists have moved there – among them the British.I’m a child of communist-era Poland. Born in 1982, I recall the acute scarcity of 1980s –– and the periodic shocks of visits to the affluent west. I was born to a teacher mum and a doctor dad: the first in their families to have had a university education. My great-grandparents were dirt-poor farmers in the countryside with no electricity. I teach film studies at the University of Warsaw and that’s largely due to the huge social advancement made possible by the communist welfare state –– one that I hate for having destroyed civic virtue in Poland, and yet one that I need to credit for making me who I am. Nobody said being Polish was simple.After communism fell in 1989, class became a dirty word. Poverty in Polish film, if portrayed at all, had an almost metaphysical heft to it: no film-maker dared to explore its causes in government policies. One was either “successful”, or thrown on to the trash heap of doomed deprivation.Had it been not for the British cinema of Ken Loach and Mike Leigh, Polish audiences in the 1990s would have forgotten what class meant. We were drawn to films such as Riff-Raff, Raining Stones and Secrets and Lies. With their focus on working-class characters full of vitality, these films offered a freshness missing from our cinema. Years later, I understood where that affinity and respect for the everyday life of the disenfranchised stemmed from. A moment in Lindsay Anderson’s brilliant Every Day Except Christmas never fails to move me: the film-makers thank their subjects (porters at Covent Garden market) for being who they are and doing what they do.In Poland, the class alienation of the late 1990s was near-total: the urban intelligentsia aspired instead to Woody Allen’s New York City, where each night seemed to bring a new gallery opening , intellectual flights of fancy and erotic possibilities. The catastrophic process of shutting down vocational schools was triggered at the same time –– why produce workers when we can have intellectuals and business-people instead? At the same time, a similar betrayal of the working-class in the UK was being fiercely analysed in the work of Loach, Leigh, and others. We loved their films but we failed to recognise that we were following the same perilous path those works decried.Around 2004, many of my friends started emigrating to the UK. Just as many of us were finishing universities, Poles of my generation came to the realisation that even a menial job in the UK paid better and brought firmer prospects than a university degree could warrant in Poland. Our class consciousness grew sharply and rapidly.Now the EU door is being slammed shut. Just as the UK shows its less-welcoming face, Poland is undergoing a deep crisis of national unity, as populist politicians are tearing the social fabric apart by pitting citizens against each other (most recently by scapegoating the LGBTQ+ community). One ritual that didn’t change is that last year I went to see another movie by Ken Loach: Sorry We Missed You, about a package carrier with a precarious existence inside the nightmare of late capitalism. The voice of the 83-year-old British director felt as fresh as ever –– only this time, there was no mistaking that he was speaking of Polish experience, too. Ruefully, we had caught up to Loach’s vision.For me, British cinema remains exemplary in bringing class awareness to the fore while maintaining the highest artistic standards. The social sensitivity of films such as Joanna Hogg’s privilege-examining The Souvenir, Francis Lee’s God’s Own Country and Andrew Haigh’s Weekend is something I hope to see in Polish films one day. Paweł Pawlikowski’s Cold War, as beautiful as it is, historicises class struggle by placing its cross-class romance firmly in a black and white, 1:1.33-ratio.And yet our social reality is so deeply complex right now, it seems ripe for artistic exploration. Class tensions between Polish millennials and boomers are exploding. The urban and the rural areas are at sharp ideological odds. And then, there are the immigrant communities: most notably the Ukrainians, but also others. A gay British couple I know recently moved to a postindustrial city in Poland and are eagerly exploring the Polish artistic scene, even as one of them commutes daily to Warsaw to work for an international corporation. How I would long to see a film on people like them: carving out a space for themselves in a post-Brexit world and enriching Polish society by their presence.When it comes to my relationship with British culture, this whole article could simply be a list of the iconic bands and singers the UK gave us. Or it could be a list of film directors, artists, writers or historical sites. My mum’s favourite band was the Beatles, my dad’s the Rolling Stones. These days, we play grime at parties.With more than 200,000 Lithuanians settled in the UK, British culture is intertwined with almost every family in Lithuania. So for those of us reading the news on our smartphones on the morning of 24 June 2016, during the Midsummer weekend – the most celebrated festival after Christmas in the Baltics – it was one of the most bizarre, surreal, hard-to-believe experience we’ve ever had. Dark uncertainty crept in about the Britain we thought we knew, and stayed there, growing.I briefly lived in London, and often visit the UK to install shows by Pakui Hardware, the artistic duo that I run with Ugnius Gelguda. To me, experiencing British culture was like being inside Zadie Smith’s White Teeth: dense, transgressive, ironic, full of friction and with intriguing chance encounters.Despite struggling to cover their ever-increasing rents and public transport tickets, contemporary artists, curators and writers have clung to London for its dynamism, its compulsive attraction and also its indifference to who you are.The city’s anonymity – animosity almost – brought people together in order to survive. There, acquaintances grew into friendships, friendships grew into communities, communities into art spaces, organisations, and advocacy groups. These smaller community-driven organisations actively pointed to, criticised and took action on faulty points of the status quo of the art world, forcing even large-scale institutions to change their funding and mediation policies in London and other British cities.Here we stumble on the most obvious and prevalent problem today not only in the UK, but the world in general: the urban-rural ide. The British culture I’ve been discussing proliferates in cities – which serve as havens for outsiders, “deviants” from the norm. Rural areas cultivate a more homogenous, white version of British culture. No wonder nationalism and protectionism have been exponentially growing over the past couple of decades, and with the help of populist politicians, are thriving today.It is precisely this conservative, enclosed and frankly dangerous “culture” that has proliferated and been elevated in Britain after Brexit. Immediately after the Brexit deal was signed, the first signs of open and normalised hostility towards anyone and anything that does not comply with this new identity politics spilled out immediately, for instance on the BBC’s Question Time. Not to mention the recently passed policy on performers’ visas, making it increasingly difficult to maintain a dynamic and vital cultural exchange between the UK and the rest of the world. It is immensely sad, not only for us foreigners, but to also see British artists devastated by those surreal and dark shifts in their country.This summer, in July, Ugnius Gelguda and I will have our first institutional solo show in the UK at Baltic centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead. “Finally something Baltic in Baltic,” commented some after we announced this news. It’s not going to be the first Baltic-Baltic exchange, however – a few of our artists have already been presented there. It only shows how vibrant the cultural exchange between Britain and other countries has been. This vital flow of cultures, of people, of ideas is what constitutes British culture. At least in my view. Please don’t build a dam to stop it. Build dikes to protect the island from rising sea levels.Naturally it was Phoebe Waller-Bridge who was the last piece of the puzzle, confirming that it’s fine to talk dirty and be something of a monster, as long as you do it with a British accent. Like so many others around the world, I am obsessed with Fleabag – season two was last year’s best TV after Chernobyl. That Waller-Bridge’s series isn’t more successful in Sweden is partly the fault of Amazon for not investing enough time and money here, and partly the fault of the majority of Swedish TV viewers: they’re just not ready for a new wave of challenging, genre-bending British television.Of course, that last sentence is prejudicial, but still, the facts remain: here in the north, new episodes of Midsomer Murders attract far more viewers than a new season of Line of Duty. It’s weird, I know.There have been some successes over the years, obviously. Downton Abbey was a big hit in Sweden – I’ve never had so many angry emails as when I wrote about Matthew Crawley’s necessary death. The success of The Crown also showed that the Swedish crowd are still hungry for British costume dramas.For a long time it was through SVT, the Swedish equivalent of the BBC, that the best British shows got a window here. Nowadays it’s easier, with Netflix, HBO Nordic, Amazon and others., which have allowed us to discover and enjoy Bodyguard, Sex Education, the wonderful Derry Girls and the fantastic first season of The End of the F*** ing World.But still, I envy you. When The Bridge was broadcast, the show’s creator Hans Rosenfeldt and I often talked about how difficult it is to write dialogue for interrogation scenes. You have the master of that in Jed Mercurio. You also have two of the very best in Waller-Bridge and Sally Wainwright, and you take better care of and value scriptwriters more than in Sweden.Still, and I write this with respect: I loathe Britannia and get tired just thinking about The Stranger on Netflix. Also, what painful disappointments Catherine the Great, Dracula and A Christmas Carol were.Around the world, more and more shows are produced and the ones that dare to push boundaries and test new, surprising ways to win viewers’ hearts are fewer and fewer – even if there is more TV than ever before.In this regard, and with a few exceptions, it is surprising that British television isn’t at the forefront globally. Sure, not everything can be as smart as Killing Eve, as brave as Top Boy or as humanly funny and tragic as Catastrophe. But when British TV is great it is really great: as a TV critic, I would love to see a new show that I can’t stop thinking about and, like Fleabag, want to analyse to pieces.I want something that melts my heart and brings tears to my eyes of either laughter or sorrow. And well, it’s bound to happen, since Brits can say almost anything and still make it sound polite and charming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efc741f79d5fe978646914daec2690a202b175b2/0_127_3048_1829/master/3048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03916334293d39ae3db089084b55e86a","title":"glowing glowing gone plunge in glow worm numbers revealed","story":"Glow-worm numbers have plunged by three-quarters since 2001, research in England has revealed, with the climate crisis a clear factor.The larvae feed on damp-loving snails, and increasingly hot and dry summers mean fewer prey and a greater risk of glow-worms becoming desiccated.Some of the 19 sites studied across Essex are on nature reserves. The data there showed that clearing scrub and coppicing woods to open up ground helped offset glow-worm losses, indicating that conservation action is possible.Glow-worms are small beetles and they exist in small patches across the UK. The females glow green to attract mates. They are wingless, making it hard for them to rebuild lost populations.“Glow-worms were thought to be declining, and probably for several decades now, but there was no hard evidence,” said Tim Gardiner, of the Environment Agency, who led the research. “We have shown a big decline, and at many different sites around Essex. The changing climate has undoubtedly played a role.”Scientists warned in February that “fates of humans and insects are intertwined”, with the huge declines reported in some places only the “tip of the iceberg”. They acknowledge that little is known about most of the estimated 5.5 million insect species but said enough was understood to warrant immediate action.Widespread insect declines threaten a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, with dire consequences for humanity, some scientists have said.Gardiner emphasised the intrinsic wonder of glow-worms. “I still remember when I saw my first one. It was just magical, and every summer I still get a pang of excitement on seeing the first one. Wouldn’t it be sad if there weren’t these things any more?”The glow-worm research was one of a dozen studies published in a special issue of Insect Conservation and Diversity. Many report declines in some – but not all – insects.In the US, scientists compiled sightings of the endangered Poweshiek skipperling butterfly from 1872 to now, showing that its geographic range has shrunk dramatically over time. Evidence from 217 sites shows the butterfly was historically common across the prairies of the upper mid-western US. But populations declined rapidly in the past 20 years as habitat was destroyed, and the butterfly is now extinct at all but five locations.Prof Raphael Didham, of the University of Western Australia, who edited the special issue of the journal, said: “The problem is clearly global in extent, but the solutions needed are going to be many-fold and range from local inidual choices to regional policies that reduce the intensity of human impacts on the environment, and global commitments to maintaining insect bioersity.”But he said the available data did not in itself constitute evidence for a sudden and catastrophic collapse of all insect populations. “In fact, we need to be equally worried about some examples of insect population increases as well, such as new incursions of invasive species, or cyclical pest outbreaks, and geographic range expansions due to climate change that could disrupt sensitive natural ecosystems,” Didham said.On the plight of glow-worms in England, Gardiner said: “People should visit their local sites and become a champion for glow-worms. They’re not legally protected and by the time they become legally protected, it may be too late.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e9895afdb0aa726360ef7a25f2f4abfa13d2928/0_223_5302_3182/master/5302.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6465b8c5dc9533203ed95377f20fa298","title":"truly extreme winter 2019 20 in europe by far hottest on record","story":"Climate crisis likely to have supercharged temperatures around world, data suggestsThis winter has been by far the hottest recorded in Europe, scientists have announced, with the climate crisis likely to have supercharged the heat.The EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) data dates back to 1855. It said the average temperature for December, January and February was 1.4C above the previous winter record, which was set in 2015-16. New regional climate records are usually passed by only a fraction of a degree. Europe’s winter was 3.4C hotter than the average from 1981-2010.The unseasonal heat has led to the failure of the ice-wine harvest in Germany and snow having to be imported for sporting events in Sweden and Russia. In Helsinki, Finland, the average temperature for January and February was more than 6C higher than the 1981-2010 average. In the UK, serious flooding is likely to have been made worse by higher temperatures, as in 2015.“Whilst this winter was a truly extreme event in its own right, it is likely that these sorts of events have been made more extreme by the global warming trend,” said Carlo Buontempo, director of C3S.But he added: “Seeing such a warm winter is disconcerting, but does not represent a climate trend as such. Seasonal temperatures, especially outside the tropics vary significantly from year to year.”Nonetheless, scientists expect global heating to increase the number of temperature extremes and this is continuing around the world. Australia, which has suffered catastrophic bushfires, has just recorded its second-hottest summer on record, only a little cooler than the record set the year before.In Antarctica, the temperature rose above 20C for the first time on record in February, almost a full degree higher than the previous record set in 1982.Across the globe as a whole, 2019 was the second hottest on record for the planet’s surface and both the past five years and the past decade were the hottest in 150 years. The previous hottest year was in 2016, but temperatures were boosted that year by a natural El Niño event. The heat in the world’s oceans reached a new record level in 2019, showing “irrefutable and accelerating” heating of the planet, according to scientists.In the UK, the Met Office said in January that a series of high temperature records were broken in 2019 as a consequence of the climate crisis. This included the hottest temperature ever recorded in the country: 38.7C on 25 July in Cambridge.2020 is a crucial year in the fight to halt the climate emergency and prevent the damaging impacts worsening.

However, with apparel experiencing the same difficult trading pressures as others across the UK retail market, the company needed to raise additional investment in order for it to continue.”Administrators plan for the business to carry on trading via the House of Holland website while they attempt to secure new investment that could protect the future of the brand. Holland stepped down as the creative director of the business last month.House of Holland started in 2008 as a Paypal link on the Myspace page of Holland, then a fashion editor for teen magazines. He gained fame with a range of “fashion groupie” T-shirts with slogans such as “Let’s play naked Twister Linda Evangelista”. The range was modelled by his then housemate Deyn, who became one of the it models of the decade.Holland met Deyn when he was still a schoolboy living in Ramsbottom, Lancashire, and they became part of a celebrity group of friends including Alexa Chung, Daisy Lowe and Nick Grimshaw.The House of Holland brand is sold worldwide in department stores including Selfridges and on sites such as Net-a-Porter.House of Holland’s difficulties come amid challenging times for fashion businesses hit by rising costs and consumers switching to spending on experiences such as eating out or holidays.Department stores, a key outlet for designer labels, have come under particular pressure with both Debenhams and House of Fraser closing stores in the past 18 months, despite being rescued from administration. Beales went into administration in January putting 22 stores and 1,300 jobs at risk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55501897ca334911ff34829b05f4e8b1ecd1ac15/0_0_3105_2400/master/3105.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0a67dd14bd901dd7e11271cfd8ff3b1 480w","title":"bottomless brunch unlimited prosecco sounds like a good idea until youre on your fifth glass","story":"I was eavesdropping, on a bus. What struck me was less the content than that the couple didn’t look like the kind of young people this kind of thing would happen to. They looked like they played touch rugby and drank alcohol-free gin. But anyway …At a bottomless brunch, the girl’s friend had been ejected after 45 minutes. She wasn’t even that drunk – the bouncer had just decided she was. “What was she doing that made them think that?” is the question the guy should have asked, but clearly he wasn’t a trained journalist. While the bouncer was outside arguing with the friend, a third bruncher, a man, stood up – he, again, wasn’t that drunk, apparently – and just happened to fall clean over, like a tree that had been chainsawed. Then they all got kicked out, and wasn’t that quite unfair, given that they had each paid £30 to drink as much prosecco as they humanly could?I nodded in silent, eavesdroppers’ agreement: it was unfair. But then, I think the whole fandango of the bottomless brunch is pretty rum.Prosecco is not the only bottomless option – cocktails are another favourite – but it’s the clear frontrunner. My Mr is a fierce prosecco-phobe, so I have only done it once or twice. It’s so-so value, I suppose. You have to be drinking pretty fast to make it worthwhile, considering a regular bottle in a bar would be only £24 and it’s so early in the day. There’s also usually a time limit of 90 minutes, even for people who don’t fall over, which goes against both the principle of brunch (an American import, possibly their only contribution to laziness) and that of binge-drinking (homegrown, signifying that, once you have started, you don’t stop).Recently, themes have started to spring up: a Mexican-themed taco bottomless brunch, a drag theme. I was snooty about these from a distance, believing them to be a calculated distraction from the main downside: that the other tables are fiendishly noisy. Something in that combination of drinking so fast, and the drink always being fizzy and usually stronger than beer – some mysterious alchemy – makes everyone shout their heads off. I hate being that person who glares at people who are laughing. Yet when I hear the joke, because it was delivered at 10,000 decibels, and it wasn’t that funny, but the blast of laughter afterwards could lift a toupee, I’m afraid I am that person.Anyway, as I dove deeper into the themes, I came across the West End musical bottomless brunch, and even though this was more expensive and I hate pastries and muffins, and I couldn’t drink 65 quid’s worth of anything in an hour and a half, you could rinse me for any amount of money for showtunes. The marketing for this kind of thing is usually heavily feminised “girls’ day out” kind of stuff, the language of the spa day without the wellness. This is in marked contrast to the original all-you-can-drink concept, which was (look away if you can’t abide international bickering) from either Tokyo or Moscow or New York or Ayia Napa. Someone I know who can remain anonymous (my brother) used to go to Tokyo specifically for the nomihoudai, which neatly translates as all-you-can-drink, a companion activity to the tabehoudai, all-you-can-eat, and had precisely no complaints except that there were never any women there. It’s possible he was just frequenting the wrong establishments. It’s possible, in fact, that he never made this complaint, I just guessed it after asking him for the 17th time whether or not he had a girlfriend. It’s possible that he is actually married, but doesn’t want to reward my curiosity by mentioning it.Nomidoudai tend to be really good value – about a tenner – but this is where the 90- or 120-minute slots originated, and there is a ton of accrued etiquette. You’re not supposed to take a sip until everyone is present, so people hate you if you’re late. It’s very vulgar to order five drinks as your final round – I don’t know why I called this etiquette, this is just “try to be normal” – and you should never try to tack a second nomihoudai on to your first. That said, you can always go somewhere else and do it again. There are bizarro places where you have to order everything you will want to drink in the first 10 minutes, ripoff joints where the drinks are ersatz beer and watery cocktails, and places where you can negotiate your terms with a tout outside the bar, but frankly, you could put that kind of chutzpah and language skill to better use, maybe start a gambling ring or fight crime.On balance, I feel that there are so many downsides, pitfalls, rip-offs and hazards to the bottomless brunch that you could save more money just drinking half a bottle of vodka before you go out. But the young people on the bus disagreed they were pretty adamant that if they could just shed the rogue elements of their group, they would be back next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90a00057c9ffce0517714672df2828691a238b66/0_326_5040_3024/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e1ec18bdfe21f062fa2e1c8f23b8dc8","title":"david atherton recipe homemade baked beans","story":"It’s quick and easy to make your own baked beans.

They are a great source of protein, fibre and resistant starch, which helps to feed our gut bacteria. They are also quick and easy to prepare. Yet shop-bought beans can be laced with needless sugars and additives – and they are so easy to make. I love having homemade beans on toast after a weekend run.

Chefs from Spain to Estonia tell us their best-kept food secretsAfter all these years of Swedes working in French kitchens and Italian chefs moving to Denmark, you could be forgiven for thinking of European cuisine as one big homogenous offering, a pot not so much melting as melted into one big lump of Eurofood. But all it takes is a walk through a market in some new place for the untapped riches of the continental table to hit you. We asked 12 stellar chefs – some Michelin-starred, several of the World’s 50 Best, all passionate – to tell us about the local dishes they think we need to try.In Flanders we make waterzooi, a fragrant chicken stew. You boil a chicken with carrots, leeks and celery to make a stock. You take the chicken out and add a roux, to thicken up the stock into a white sauce, with a bit of cream and some fresh herbs, then you put the chicken back in and serve with potato or bread. Belgian cuisine is full of robust flavours and slow cooking.Peter Goossens, Hof van Cleve, KruisemEveryone is eating semla right now – big fat cardamom buns with marzipan and sugar, topped with whipped cream. Traditionally, you would eat them on the last Tuesday of February or the first of March, for Mardi Gras. Nowadays, people eat them throughout Lent. Bakeries all over the country compete for the newspaper verdicts of whose is the best each year. I make the version my mother taught me.Niklas Ekstedt, Ekstedt, StockholmI love roasted lemon-oregano rooster – garlic slices hidden in the thighs – with slowly baked potatoes, served with a side of freshly made slaw of fine-julienne lettuce hearts, lots of red wine vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, dill and barrel-matured feta cheese. Families usually have this as a Sunday roast, but you can find it on the menu in any decent tavern or restaurant.Nikos Roussos, Funky Gourmet, Athens and Opso, LondonI am a Berlin native, and eisbein is something I grew up with. My grandmother always made it for me. It’s a pretty ugly dish and very fatty, as it is traditionally made with ham hock it comes with half a kilo of sauerkraut and half a kilo of yellow peas. At the restaurant we have brought it up to date. We have substituted the pork for suckling pig, so it’s less greasy. We flavour and cook it like my grandmother did, and then the Asian part of my cooking philosophy steps in and we deep-fry the meat, so that it becomes really crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. We serve it with a hint of the cream from the yellow peas, and we substitute the sauerkraut for pickled ginger.Tim Raue, Restaurant Tim Raue, BerlinI have always loved the texture of sweetbreads, the dish’s gourmet side. Rather than braising it, my grandfather André would cook it in a vol-au-vent and combine with crayfish. Sweetbreads are still very commonly found in this form or in a bouchée à la reine, with a mushroom sauce, as a Sunday starter for many families in France. The textures and flavours of my grandfather’s dish, which has become a classic of gastronomy, were part of my childhood. These days, I poach the sweetbread in milk flavoured with beeswax and honey, then enclose it in a beeswax shell and leave it to mature. Once ready, I cook it in a pan with butter. Anne-Sophie Pic, Maison Pic, ParisCalabria is famous for stockfish – dried cod, which is generally prepared with pasta. You soak the fish in water for three days, then slice it and add capers, olive oil and lemon zest. It’s quite a typical dish for Christmas Eve dinner. The whole preparation of the fish is a sort of ritual. I was always fascinated by how it was my grandfather who looked after it and not my grandmother, who was usually in charge of the kitchen. From time to time, I have featured the fish on the menu, in particular with ziti (short pasta) and ’nduja. Anthony Genovese, Il Pagliaccio, RomeLike most Basques, I’m crazy about fish and seafood. Txangurro a la donostiarra is a stuffed crab dish created in the early 20th century by a local Basque chef. Crabmeat is mixed with onion, tomato and breadcrumbs and stuffed into the empty crab shell to be baked. Our yellow-crab dish is a nod to this classic, still redolent of the sea, but true to our philosophy. We use collagen, cauliflower, spider crab and an in-your-face fashion-yellow shell. We are always playing with the relationship between tradition and modernity.Elena Arzak, Arzak, San SebastianZur is a soup with a lightly sour flavour that is very popular in rural Poland. It is made from so-called white borsch: whole-rye bread and crusts placed in a jar and left in a warm place for two days to ferment. It can be stored for up to two weeks in tightly corked bottles in a cool place. The soup is prepared with a vegetable stock of parsley root, carrots, leeks, onion and crushed garlic cloves, with dried forest mushrooms. You add traditional rural sausage, which you remove once cooked and slice thinly before returning to the soup to serve. You can also add lean bacon, finely cubed and fried. You serve the zur with potatoes seasoned with onion fried in oil.Zbyszek Siemieniec, Restauracja Wentzl, KrakowBlack bread with Baltic herring and boiled eggs is a fairly rustic dish that people usually eat at home on Sundays. The herrings are pickled with strong pepper and a bit of garlic, and the bread is savoury, salted and intensely malted. It makes for a beautiful dish, and will bring back memories for every Estonian person. It’s the first thing people miss when they are abroad.Orm Oja, Noa, TallinnFrika is a traditional dish of potatoes and cheese cooked in pork fat and served with mountain herbs. Shepherds prepare it in the Slovenian Alps, but you find something very similar in the Italy and Austrian mountains, too. Which is the beauty of the dish: it doesn’t respect borders it showcases the culture that we share. You heat pork fat in a pan, and throw in chopped potato to coat, then cover with offcuts from cheesemaking and cook slowly on one side before turning it all over and cooking on the other. The way the cheese caramelises with the potato is delicious. You serve it hot, finished with freshly picked herbs.Ana Ros, Hiša Franko, KobaridThe extremely ugly lumpfish comes close to the shore to breed around this time of year, so the roe is harvested and eaten fresh. It is classically served on a piece of toast with dill and some creme fraiche, as a light lunch or a starter. The produce is something you can only source right here, so it really is particular to Denmark. We have used it in many different ways at Relae, once with hazelnut milk and fermented celeriac. Christian Puglisi, Relae, CopenhagenBoxty is a semi-fermented potato cake you find all over Ireland, but I think it comes from Cavan, in the border region. You cook the potato out and mix it with flour and seasoning, then leave to age and dry for a couple of days or weeks, until it’s like a very firm gnocchi, which you can then slice. To eat it, you fry it in a bit of oil, finish with butter, if you want to go the full hog, then serve with runny fried eggs and smoked fish – kippers or haddock. It’s one of my favourite things to have for breakfast.Keelan Higgs, Variety Jones, Dublin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95d9dec969f851e306cfdffa307e316e3cb2162b/0_304_4538_2722/master/4538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df0fc61a15a106180083d1bc599a316b","title":"premier league matches closed doors coronavirus everton","story":"The spread of coronavirus means it is likely Premier League matches will be played behind closed doors this month, a leading club executive has admitted.Sasha Ryazantsev, Everton’s chief financial officer, said banning fans from matches in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus would be a decision “forced” on clubs. However with Italian authorities having taken the decision to play Serie A fixtures behind closed doors until April, the possibility of something similar in England is increasing.“It would be a forced decision rather than one we would proactively engage in,” said Ryazantsev, who was speaking at the FT Business of Football Summit in London. “But the whole situation goes far beyond the world of sport. Of course nobody wants to play behind closed doors and I don’t think it’s inevitable at the moment that it will happen. But we feel it is quite likely it may happen in the coming weeks.”The Premier League wrote to its member clubs this week asking them to prepare contingency plans for the virus, as the official government response moved from one of containment to trying to slow the spread of the disease. In the letter, the league suggested that an outbreak of coronavirus at just one club would make it difficult to complete the season.While the Premier League’s official position remains “business as usual”, events are moving fast. In one example of changing behaviour, Gary Neville withdrew from a keynote speaking role at the Business of Football Summit, in compliance with a new policy from Sky Sports on coronavirus.Stephen Zhang, the president of Internazionale, did speak at the event. He has been outspoken on the Italian response to coronavirus, calling the president of Serie A a “clown” for postponing Inter’s match against Juventus last weekend with less than 24 hours’ notice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b14fb2c2b9d6a79ab9369125471c95abb3e95d5e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1bad296fb78d517174dfe9f67e3ec14","title":"trautmann to van dijk europeans who influenced english football","story":"We select players who have made a significant mark on the English game, including four Dutchmen and a GeorgianFew figures in the history of English football – European or otherwise – lived a more extraordinary life than Trautmann. He was the Nazi soldier who arrived in England as a prisoner of war and became a Manchester City icon after making two crucial saves in their 1956 FA Cup final victory over Birmingham City while playing with a broken neck. Although his past never entirely left him, the German, who died in 2013 at the age of 89, ultimately became a symbol of truth and reconciliation following his work in promoting Anglo-German post-war relations, for which he received an honorary OBE.It’s impossible not to take Muhren and Thijssen as a pair given the joint impact they had on Ipswich Town following their arrivals in the late 1970s. The Dutchmen transformed Ipswich into a highly technical, skilful and successful side, culminating in Bobby Robson’s men winning the 1981 Uefa Cup and finishing First Division runners-up during the same season. In an era of few overseas players in English football, Muhren and Thijssen were illuminating figures, showing clubs from these shores what was possible, and what could be achieved, with broad-thinking, outward-looking recruitment.Limpar arrived in England more than a decade after Muhren and Thijssen, yet it was still a period when overseas imports were a rarity and he too showed the benefits of ‘going European’ in the transfer market. The skilful winger played a crucial role in Arsenal winning the 1991 First Division title before being influential in Everton winning the 1995 FA Cup. Limpar’s counterattacking run from inside his own half led to Paul Rideout scoring the winning goal against Manchester United in that final.Cantona arrived in England a few months before the start of the Premier League and would go onto to become an icon of the new era of English football. Brooding, enigmatic, troubled and talented, the Frenchman drove Manchester United to sustained glory on the pitch and captured headlines off it, no more so than with that kung-fu kick in January 1995. He was a superstar footballer for a superstar age and it could be argued that without Cantona’s impact in the early days, the Premier League’s appeal would not have become so vast so quickly.Klinsmann’s arrival at Tottenham Hotspur in July 1994 was arguably the moment everyone realised English football’s profile had well and truly shifted. This was a genuine star of European football joining a club on these shores, opening the possibility of others doing the same and forging the feeling that the Premier League really was the place to be. Klinsmann more than played a part in boosting the brand with his performances and charm, and even found the time to show English people that Germans do have a sense of humour after all with his ing goal celebrations.Like Murhen and Thijssen before him, Bergkamp showed English football what was possible by going Dutch, specifically a level of talent that bordered on art. Bergkampwas a magnificent player, technically gifted and hugely creative, and without him there is no way Arsenal would have achieved what they did in the late 90s and early noughties, namely three Premier League titles and invincibility. Bergkamp raised the standard and perhaps more than any other European who has played on these shores, highlighted the benefit and beauty of embracing a continental approach.Born in Tbilisi, Kinkladze was a wonderfully talent, able to dribble through defences with almost supernatural ease, and having joined Manchester City in 1995 he became the club’s shining light during a terrible period in their history. City were relegated from the Premier League at the end of Kinkladze’s first season and it only added to the midfielder’s standing among supporters that he continued to play for the club in the second tier. More broadly, Kinkladze’s time at City shows just how deep the level of European talent arriving in England had become by the mid-90s. A full-on wave that enriched the national game at various levels.Arguably the best overseas talent – European or otherwise – to have performed on these shores and like Bergkamp was not only crucial to Arsenal’s success in the late 90s and early noughties but also helped take football in England to a whole new level, one of beauty and artistic brilliance. With his successful spell as a pundit for Sky Sports, Henry has also shown overseas imports that there can be a role for them in England post-retirement beyond coaching and management.A genuine modern-day superstar who is single-handedly redefining the art of defending with his athleticism, strength, poise and technical ability. The Dutchman is the complete centre-back and having impressed at Southampton is a key reason for why Liverpool are the European champions and destined to win this season’s Premier League title. In the post-Brexit era, Van Dijk serves as a clear reminder for anyone who requires it of the benefit of movement between Europe and England quite simply talent like his does not already exist here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54c602db056886b7072aac5b6097c94d81f3bd1/0_123_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4bfdeff7f3234a477bdefb0dafe0b6d","title":"uswnt england shebelieves cup megan rapinoe","story":"Ballon d’Or winner Megan Rapinoe has said the support of the US men’s players union in their equal pay dispute is “much appreciated” as the USWNT prepare for their opening match of the SheBelieves Cup against England on Thursday.“They have been a little light on statements before,” said the forward. “You need to be educated if you weigh in and it seems like they took time to make the statement they wanted but I have been saying for a long time that we all have to stand together.”The statement of the US National Soccer Team Players Association states that they feel the need to go public because “the Federation has been working very hard to sell a false narrative to the public and even to members of Congress. They have been using this false narrative as a weapon against current and former members of the United States Women’s National Team.”Rapinoe reciprocated the backing, saying of their male counterparts: “They think they deserve more money too. They said that if they are being underpaid it’s likely we are being underpaid too so it was a nice show of support and I look forward to more solidarity between the two teams.”Teammate Julie Ertz echoed Rapinoe’s sentiments. “Huge,” she said. “The support of men is incredible. It’s important. We cannot do it alone, I think that was huge for us and great to hear.”Rapinoe added that although she does not see an outcome to the dispute soon, she is “very confident of a positive outcome”.The 34-year-old also reflected on how much she has been pulled away from football since last summer’s World Cup victory and her personal journey on and off the pitch. Life has “changed dramatically”, she said. “It’s not in a completely different way, there are just 10 times more of everything.“It’s been something to get used to, but I do feel I’m getting a better handle on it now. It was all a little overwhelming in the fall if I’m honest.“The opportunity for financial success right now is far greater than it was but that means more days on shoots, it means more days been given to other people and it’s less days focusing and committing to the game and my craft.“You’ve got to roll with it, you can’t get too stressed out about it.“First and foremost, I want to remain a footballer, most definitely. I’m not looking to retire any time soon. I’m fully focused on the Olympics and making sure I’m prepared for that. After that, we will assess things and see where we go from there.”Having come out in support of US senator Elizabeth Warren’s campaign for the democratic nomination to run for president, Rapinoe sighed when asked of how Super Tuesday had impacted her, calling “still team Warren!” as she was led away by her press team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc1f9628e2fa83fbc62e2f94ab560eedb8babcaa/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4833cb22c318addf8d27de3fb46c1f7","title":"bbc boss says netflix could never replace public broadcaster","story":"Outgoing director general Tony Hall says BBC is ‘in the fabric of the nation’The BBC director general, Tony Hall, has said there is no way Netflix could replace the public service broadcaster, pointing out that the streaming service does not provide news coverage or distinctive regional British content.“The thing about the licence fee being paid by everybody is that you have to be universal,” said the outgoing boss of the public broadcaster.“The BBC is not Netflix. It is something that is in the absolute fabric of this nation. Netflix doesn’t do sport, it doesn’t do news, they don’t do a whole raft of things.”He said the government should be careful not to damage British society and “throw the baby out with the bathwater”: “The case for public service broadcasting is the recent floods. In Hereford and Worcester a reporter had her flat under water but broadcast for 16 hours because she cared about getting the story.”Hall also said that a subscription-style BBC would require traditional radio stations and the Freeview service to be shut down, as they cannot currently be encrypted or password-protected: “Are you really going to put a barrier between radio and people? Same with free to air television.”The outgoing BBC boss also said the the corporation needs to become less patrician in its attitude towards its audiences, moving away from the image of it as “Auntie”, while finding other sources of revenue in the future. Speaking at a media conference organised by Enders Analysis and Deloitte, he said he believed the charge will still exist in some form after the BBC’s royal charter runs out in seven years’ time: “The licence fee beyond 2027 will still matter and will still be phenomenally important for the BBC.”Hall, who will leave the organisation this summer, also said the BBC had changed enormously since he joined the organisation in the 1970s: “The culture was very different.

He also said all of the UK’s public service broadcasters needed to reinvent themselves due to changing viewing habits: “The old model simply cannot sustain it’s not a policy choice by the government, it’s the market reality of what’s happening.”Channel 4 chief executive, Alex Mahon, also told the event that the government should do more to protect the British public service broadcasting sector, warning that without intervention “our most prominent news feeds could be selected by US companies that are more concerned about profit than trust or accuracy”.She also referenced the commitment by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to spread opportunity across the whole of the UK: “Levelling up is not in our written remit but spreading opportunity across the country is in Channel 4’s genetic code.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/402d56947306e9e38fe4de1412356c49d85d3ee6/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f867abf6647b6e1d23fcbcedea192217 480w","title":"dog breeders urged to act over high levels of anxiety in pets","story":"Finnish study finds three-quarters of dogs exhibit highly problematic behaviourDog breeders need to take action to improve canine mental health, scientists have said, after research found almost three-quarters of pet dogs have highly problematic anxiety-related behaviour.While physical problems such as breathing difficulties and other health concerns relating to squashed-nosed breeds have become a hot topic, the study suggests breeders also need to focus on dogs’ behaviour.“Behavioural problems are the leading cause for the relinquishment or euthanasia of the dogs,” said Prof Hannes Lohi, a co-author of the study from the University of Helsinki.The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, is based on a survey of owners of more than 13,700 pet dogs in Finland, ning 264 breeds and ranging from young pups to elderly hounds.It examined the frequency of seven anxiety-related traits, including noise sensitivity, fear, aggression, separation problems and compulsive behaviour, as well as sub-traits within these categories, such as tail-chasing. For each, dogs were classified as having low, medium or high levels of problems.“We observed some differences such as male dogs being more often aggressive and impulsive, while female dogs were more fearful,” said Lohi.There were also differences by age: for example, high noise sensitivity was more common among older dogs, while destructive behaviour when alone – classed as a type of separation issue – was more common in young dogs. The team also looked at particular breeds, finding that while dogs of any breed could have any of the anxiety problems, particular traits were more common in certain types of dog.“As a result, selective breeding focusing on behaviour may reduce the prevalence of canine anxieties,” the authors said.Perhaps surprisingly, the team found that mixed breeds were more likely to show many of the various traits than purebred dogs – although the researchers say that may be because many of the former were probably rescue animals that potentially had had a difficult start in life and a lack of socialisation. The study has limitations: it is not clear if the trends would hold in other countries, and the team only looked at the frequency of behaviours and not their severity. It may also be that owners of dogs with behaviour problems may have been more likely to complete the questionnaire, although the researchers say their study was advertised to all owners and the findings chime with other research.Dr Rowena Packer, an expert in animal behaviour and welfare from the Royal Veterinary College, said a dog’s genetics and their environment each contributed to the way they act.“The way that both breeders and owners interact with dogs is hugely important in raising mentally healthy dogs,” she said. “This includes appropriate socialisation to people and other animals and habituation to day-to-day experiences as puppies, and positive, force-free training throughout life.”Packer noted that when it comes to heritable traits, too often the emphasis is on looks over behaviour. She said that because genetics and early environment set up dogs for the rest of their lives, breeders must do more to produce behaviourally healthy dogs. “Some of the behavioural problems highlighted in this study can lead to a lifetime of misery for affected dogs and an emotional and financial burden on their owners,” she said. “Tackling these problems through selection of behaviourally sound breeding stock, along with educating owners on appropriate interactions, environment and training for dogs, should be a high priority for all dog lovers.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b430520d647eb4a447c149f75b51cd55b17998a/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e299491881a596a46815da3af0f3339","title":"one in five europeans exposed to harmful noise pollution study","story":"Estimated 113 million people across continent affected by road noise at unhealthy levelsOne in five Europeans is exposed to harmful levels of noise pollution, and this number is set to rise in the next decade, with road traffic the biggest culprit, a new study has shown.Excessive noise can cause physical and mental illness, and is associated with higher levels of heart disease, stress and sleeplessness. About 12,000 premature deaths are caused by noise in Europe each year, according to the European Environment Agency (EEA), while noise contributes to about 48,000 cases of ischaemic heart disease.Wildlife is also affected: a study last year showed noise hampers birds’ ability to communicate, and can stop them from mating.The EEA, Europe’s environmental watchdog, warned in a report on Thursday that more people were likely to be affected by harmful noise levels in future, as the result of increasing urbanisation and mobility.Across Europe, an estimated 113 million people are affected by road traffic noise levels above 55 decibels, the threshold at which noise becomes harmful to human health by the World Health Organization’s definition.In addition, 22 million people are exposed to high levels of railway noise and 4 million people to high levels of aircraft noise. At least 12,500 European schoolchildren are estimated to suffer learning impairment because of aircraft noise. Other noisy industries affect about a million people across the continent.There are many ways to reduce noise. Electric vehicles are quieter than diesel and petrol-driven cars.Like electric vehicles, walking and cycling reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the same time as lowering the decibels. Roads can be resurfaced with smoother asphalt, traffic management can also help, and reducing speed limits works in urban areas.Town planners can also ensure there are quiet areas, such as parks or other green spaces.The EEA said it was hampered in its research by EU member states failing to supply the data required by the EU noise directive, even though the deadline was 2017. Nearly a third of the data required was not available. The EEA said this showed that countries were not taking the steps needed to address the noise problem.A spokesperson for the UK government said: “We are committed to ensuring that noise pollution is managed effectively in order to promote good health and quality of life. We have strong protections in place to avoid significant noise impacts in our planning system, environmental permitting systems, in vehicle and product standards and noise abatement legislation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d98d70bd1ffbe75dfbd40d6dea970aef65962c/0_266_3992_2395/master/3992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8daa8158ed9faa3014282a8aa3a0bb46","title":"fia says it could not prove ferraris engine operated outside rules in 2019","story":"The FIA has stated that it could not conclusively prove Ferrari’s engine had been operating outside the rules in 2019. Their statement comes in reaction to the threat of legal action from teams dissatisfied with their investigation.The FIA’s enquiry had ended in a private settlement with Ferrari, with no conclusion over the legality of the engine. Seven F1 teams were unhappy with the lack of transparency and apparent failure to address suspicions over the power unit, and issued a joint statement on Wednesday demanding clarification.On Thursday, the FIA explained that while it believed the engine may not have been operating within parameters, Ferrari insisted that Formula One’s governing body proved its case. The FIA admitted it could not do so in their statement:“The FIA was not fully satisfied, but decided that further action would not necessarily result in a conclusive case due to the complexity of the matter and the material impossibility to provide the unequivocal evidence of a breach.”The FIA decided not to pursue the issue any further “to avoid the negative consequences that a long litigation would entail, especially in light of the uncertainty of the outcome of such litigations and in the best interest of the championship and of its stakeholders,” the statement added.That the settlement remained private was covered by F1’s judicial and disciplinary rules, the FIA maintained. “The prosecuting body and all persons taking part in the inquiry are bound by an obligation of confidentiality, vis-a-vis persons or organisations not concerned with the inquiry,” their statement read.The seven teams – Mercedes, Red Bull, McLaren, Racing Point, Renault, AlphaTauri and Williams – issued a strongly-worded statement on Wednesday. The only rival teams who did not contribute were Alfa Romeo and Haas, both of whom use Ferrari engines.“We, the undersigned teams, were surprised and shocked by the FIA’s statement of 28 February regarding the conclusion of its investigation into the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One power unit,” the statement said.“After months of investigations that were undertaken by the FIA only following queries raised by other teams, we strongly object to the FIA reaching a confidential settlement agreement with Ferrari to conclude this matter.”Ferrari are yet to release any official comment on the FIA’s statement, or the seven teams’ protests. With the F1 paddock now heading to Australia for the first round in Melbourne on 15 March, further reaction is not expected until early next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0e31dbde031e767a48140f09a393c07fbeb9b80/0_91_2693_1615/master/2693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8356eee518e4028c676bac1bd82d2ec2","title":"wayne pivac needs to shed mr nice guy image if wales are to prosper","story":"Wales need to evolve after the tactical austerity of the Gatland era but must keep the abrasiveness that brought successLeo Durocher was a baseball coach who made Eddie Jones look like the what-hoing Bertie Wooster. Known as Leo the Lip, he managed the Brooklyn Dodgers after the second world war and is attributed with the saying “nice guys finish last”.He was talking to reporters in 1946 about the New York Giants and their manager, Mel Ott, as they watched the side practise. Asked by one why he never acted as a nice guy, Durocher spat back: “Do you know a nicer guy than Mel Ott? Or any of the other Giants? Why, they’re the nicest guys in the world! And where are they? In seventh place! Nice guys! I’m not a nice guy – and I’m in first place.”As Wales sift through the detritus of their Six Nations defence before the visit to Twickenham on Saturday, the question can be asked whether, in the post-Warren Gatland era, they have become too nice. It was not something of which Gatland, always ready to rattle opponents with a barb or two, was ever accused, nor his second lieutenant Shaun Edwards, who could turn the hardest player wobbly with a glare.Wayne Pivac replaced Gatland with a brief to bring a sense of adventure back to Wales after what some saw as the tactical austerity of the previous 12 years. An ultimately comfortable victory against Italy was followed by a repeat of the 10-point loss they had endured in Dublin two years earlier and a first home defeat by France in the championship for 10 years.Wales have been looking to live up to a new ideal and their performance against France was more rounded than it had been in the three previous meetings between the sides, all of which they had won by tight margins, but also more naive. Under Gatland they developed the ability to prevail at the end – think England in Cardiff last year – and beat teams through force, the way they won the grand slam against Ireland 12 months ago.The defeats against Ireland and France each contained a similar moment when the outcome was in the balance. Wales had an attacking scrum in the final quarter and on each occasion it collapsed. They were penalised, much to their disgust, believing the referee had been conned on each occasion by the opposition tighthead, boring in on the opposite side of the scrum where the referee was standing and putting such pressure on the Welsh front row that they could not stay up.Wales had conceded three penalties in the scrum against Italy that they felt had gone the wrong way and the following week Pivac talked about painting the right picture for referees by scrummaging straight. That got nowhere in Dublin and ahead of the France match, the prop Wyn Jones was wheeled out to claim Les Bleus cheated in the scrum by boring in. A French prop duly received a yellow card in Cardiff, but at the moment of reckoning it was France who got the decision.Wales should not be relying on referees, especially in an area such as the scrum where most officials just want to see the ball emerge. They should have sorted out the issues themselves and when Demba Bamba came on they would have known, after the England match in Paris, that scrummaging straight was not his raison d’etre. England’s front rowers Joe Marler, Ellis Genge and Kyle Sinckler will not be spending the week poring over the rule book, the latter two very much in the image of their head coach, abrasive and confrontational.England will look to push Wales around, as they did Ireland in the last round. Gatland’s Wales talked about earning the right to play, which translated meant winning the battle of the gainline and asserting themselves physically over their opponents. That will apply at Twickenham and a tendency of the last two rounds Wales need to lose is the gift-wrapping of tries for the opposition.“You cannot rely on the referee when it comes to the scrum,” said the former Wales hooker Garin Jenkins, who was not known for his love of compromise. “In my day, you sorted out tightheads who bored in and while times have changed, there are still ways of solving problems. Wales will need an edge if they are to beat England and I expect Alun Wyn Jones and Ken Owens to provide it. It is time for a bit of sporting nastiness, within the laws, the sort Wales showed against Ireland last year.”England have developed an edge under Jones after the “niceness” of the Stuart Lancaster period when, after the shenanigans during the 2011 World Cup, a cultural revolution blew in, although they are still prone to lapses. Jones is similar to Gatland, ready to highlight weak spots he detects in opponents, although his words sometimes blow up in his face, like last month when he boasted about how brutal his side intended to be in Paris.Pivac said before Wales’s match in Ireland that he had no time for trash talking and, so far, he has not come into Jones’s line of fire. Is it a sign that Jones is anticipating another match when he could consider declaring at half-time? In the last two Six Nations matches between the sides at Twickenham, England led 19-0 and 12-0, but in both were clinging on at the end.The challenge for Pivac is to evolve Wales’s attacking game while not diluting their obduracy and capacity to somehow find a way out of holes. Twickenham would be some place to start. No more Mr Nice Guy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aa83d2f32b1a217a9bdce084af8ba9264d29e01/0_405_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48afd14f2253a0352e2ab0dc0bba0289","title":"do you have a question about podcasts for our critic miranda sawyer","story":"The Observer’s audio critic is here to help find your perfect podcast.

Its stars, and Blackman, explain its significance“I want this show to reach people like Claire from Devon – people who are naive to these experiences. I want people to feel uncomfortable with what they are seeing. For you to see another person’s point of view, you have to go through it.”Kiké Brimah is explaining the world behind Malorie Blackman’s hit young-adult novel series Noughts and Crosses, a race-reversed story of love and prejudice, which has now been adapted for BBC One.Written by one of the country’s most celebrated black female authors, the books dissect the inequalities between black and white Britons by turning them on their head, and imagining a world in which black supremacy is the norm, and Europe lives in the shadow of colonial Africa (renamed “Aprica”). The first book was published two decades ago, but Brexit, Meghxit and the current political regime mean they offer a particularly prescient and vivid representation of what is going on in black people’s minds. In the books, white “noughts” have their names mispronounced, are labelled as gang members or are dismissed as “uppity”. Such is the timeliness of the show that the grime star Stormzy – a longtime fan of Blackman – also makes a cameo as a newspaper editor, Kolawale, in a role created specifically for the adaptation.Brimah, a newcomer, plays Minerva, the unapologetically black, privileged younger sister of the “cross” protagonist Sephy (Masali Baduza), while Jack Rowan plays Sephy’s childhood friend turned love interest, Callum – a nought trying to make a positive impact on the world despite adversity. While Sephy’s family – led by Paterson Joseph as her high-powered politician father – seem to have it all, relations are strained. Meanwhile, Callum’s family is poverty-stricken, but proud. Rowan hadn’t read the book before he was cast, but it quickly made its mark on the actor, best known for roles in Peaky Blinders and the Channel 4 thriller Born to Kill. “I hadn’t noticed its impact, but, once I read it, I totally understood why it had one. To have the opportunity to work on something that was, and is, empowering to so many felt like poetry,” he says.The six-episode series sees Sephy and Callum’s relationship grow ever more complicated as they come of age, tackling prejudice and ignorance from their families and the wider world. Like the novels, the adaptation pulls no punches when it comes to race. Blackman describes Noughts and Crosses as “her version of Romeo and Juliet” and the parallels are clear, with Sephy and Callum separated by society, but united by love.The first episode contains a scene that particularly emphasises the gulf between them. In it, Callum sees Sephy for the first time since they were children and injures his hand on broken glass. She comes to his rescue by giving him a plaster – but it is brown rather than white. A minuscule detail in the book, on screen its power is hugely amplified.While the plot initially focuses on the relationship between Callum and Sephy, the series also delves into racism more broadly, with the “noughts” estranged by society and targeted by the police. As far as racism is concerned, Blackman views it as an all-too-prescient tale. “Unfortunately, the facts show there is more hate crime in Britain nowadays, with people being judged on skin colour, religion or sexual orientation,” she says. “It seems as if things have improved maybe as far as access to information and knowledge on other cultures is concerned, but unfortunately some people view anyone who is different to them as something to be fearful and suspicious of, and that is a damn shame.”Indeed, while watching the young white men targeted in the series, it is hard not to think of the many black people who have lost their lives due to racism. Here, black policemen savagely attack young white boys with their weapons, spitting the word “blanker” (a derogatory word for noughts) with venom. The police brutality ultimately leads to an innocent nought in hospital.The series was filmed primarily in South Africa – and language, music, lighting, costume and makeup were used to represent this flipped world, be it ideals of beauty, the dominance of African cultural norms or even the gestures people use to greet each other. And – along with cinematic milestones including Black Panther, Hidden Figures and Girls Trip – it feels like an important step in the representation of black people’s experiences on screen. The party scene in the first episode in particular is black inside and out, from the African clothing to the up-tempo music, and the chants that represent a culture that is not shown on TV most of the time.For Baduza, they were creating something “that had never been done – it was so great celebrating culture, our culture”, she says. “From the props to the costumes to the hair. Everything was so unapologetically black and African, and that was so perfect. I was happy to be a part of that. Africa was the norm on set and working like this helped me be comfortable.” For Brimah, it was “a moment … seeing so many black people in one room and we were all in positions of power and in royalty”.For white viewers, it may prove unsettling and unusual not to see themselves reflected back as the dominant force, but it will probably prove eye-opening for audiences of all colours. “I hope it teaches people, and allows them to see people who don’t look like them,” says Rowan. “I hope it teaches someone something new about racism, and they can say: ‘I get it.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/108b1a2d181f0f13f50964e94b1abda519853392/0_782_2343_1405/master/2343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c6f5709b8952feec51e06880df5cc80","title":"us bans electric shock treatment children boston area","story":"FDA ban brings an end to decades-long battle against use of ‘aversive therapy’ at the Judge Rotenberg Center in MassachusettsThe US government has banned an electric shock machine that is used to zap children and young adults with special needs in a school outside Boston – the only institution in the world known to practice the controversial punishment “treatment”.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken the extremely rare move of imposing a total ban on the production and use of the electric shock machines, known as electrical stimulation devices. It said the ban – only the third such comprehensive prohibition of a medical device in FDA history – was necessary to “protect public health”.The ban brings to an end a decades-long battle against the use of electric shocks at the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center (JRC) in Canton, Massachusetts. Disability groups and international human rights organisations have campaigned ceaselessly to outlaw the use of so-called “aversive therapy”, where pain is inflicted on vulnerable children in order to discourage them from self-harming or aggressive behavior.More than 40 special needs residents of JRC, many with severe forms of autism, are understood to be on the electric shock regime. Managers of the center insisted the device was safe and pointed out that the use of shocks was approved in each case by the state family courts.But over the years there have been a number of scandals at the school. In 2007 a boy was strapped to a gurney and given 77 electric shocks over a three hour period for bad behavior – only for it to be discovered that the order to inflict the pain had come from an outside phone call made by a prankster.In 2010, the  gained access to the school and reported on its controversial practices. During the visit it was revealed that one student had been living at the center for 22 years and was still being shocked on average 33 times a week.A video recording also emerged in the course of a civil trial that showed a student, then aged 18, being zapped 31 times over seven hours. As he is shocked he is heard screaming: “That hurts, that hurts.”Supporters of the school, including several parents, say its practice of “aversive therapy” has improved lives, and in some cases saved their children from self-induced injury or even death.In 2013, the UN’s then monitor on torture released a report that found that the use of the device as a routine form of behavior control violated the UN convention against torture.Announcing the ban, the FDA said that it had reached this rare step because it had concluded that the devices presented an “unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury”. A review of the evidence showed that residents who were routinely shocked faced a number of significant psychological and physical risks including depression, anxiety, PTSD, pain, burns and tissue damage.The federal agency listed further possible risks including: “Suicidality, chronic stress, acute stress disorder, neuropathy, withdrawal, nightmares, flashbacks of panic and rage, hyper-vigilance, insensitivity to fatigue or pain, changes in sleep patterns, loss of interest, difficulty concentrating, and injuries from falling”.Campaigners against the electric shock machines hailed the FDA’s ban as a huge advance.Laurie Ahern, who has led opposition to the devices for more than a decade as president of Disability Rights International, said she was grateful that the FDA had prohibited “the electric shock machines that torture children and adults with disabilities at JRC. Finally, the residents there might find some freedom from horrific pain and fear and live the rest of their lives in peace.”The FDA’s ban will come into effect 30 days after its final rule is registered. In special cases where iniduals need a transition away from the shocks on to other forms of therapy a period of 180 days will be allowed.JRC said in a statement that it will continue to advocate for use of electric shocks as “life-saving treatment”. It accused the FDA of reaching its decision “based on politics, not facts”, complaining that federal officials declined even to meet with parents of students on the regime.It insisted “there is no evidence of physical or psychological side effects”.An association of parents of residents of the center whose children routinely wear the devices and are zapped through pads attached to their arms or legs put out their own statement. “The FDA’s actions can only be interpreted one way – it is saying that our children’s lives do not matter.”The machines are known internally within JRC as “graduated electronic decelerators” – GED. They were invented by Matthew Israel, a psychologist with no medical training.During the 2010 tour of the school, the  was told by Israel how he had come up with the idea of using pain to discourage harmful behavior when he read an utopian novel called Walden Two. The book depicted a fictitious community in which negative behavior was systemically thwarted.Israel began experimenting with the practical application of “aversives” in 1971 starting with king with spoons and pinching. He then created his own electric shock machines.Over the years, understanding has grown of how to treat severe autism and other conditions in which iniduals can be extremely aggressive or harm themselves with head banging or eye gouging. The medical consensus is now that positive behavior support through rewards and teaching appropriate skills is both more effective and safer.William Maisel, the FDA’s top official on evaluating medical devices, said: “Through advancements in medical science, there are now more treatment options available to reduce or stop self-injurious or aggressive behavior, thus avoiding the substantial risk” the electric shock devices present."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd33f824017ebce3088765c6401f939394e3f6f1/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7049ccfa297d8fa6fb28ece252c40f6b 1010w","title":"construction starts in netherlands on longest cycling bridge in europe","story":"The 800-metre Blauwe Loper will only be accessible to cyclists, pedestrians – and batsConstruction has started in the Netherlands on what will be Europe’s longest bridge for cyclists and pedestrians – stretching over a lake, canal, motorway and nature reserve – to connect a new village to its closest town.The so-called “Blue carpet bridge”, or Blauwe Loper, will be 800 metres long, but there are plans to ultimately extend it to 1km in length. The first phase is scheduled for completion by next Christmas.The bridge will only be accessible to cyclists and pedestrians – and bats. Its LED lighting has been designed to assist the creatures in finding their way from the nearby nature reserve to the Oldambtmeer lake. The bridge will also be painted in “bat-friendly” green.The bridge has been designed to last for at least 80 years despite being made from wood, which was sourced from Gabon in Central Africa.Reinder Lanting, a project leader told the Dagblad van het Noorden, a regional daily: “We think we can stretch it to a kilometre by connecting it to the main street in Blauwestad.“This bridge is not going to rot. That is because it is technically well designed. The wood is not pressed together but has a sort of venting system.”Local dignitaries joined an event to watch the laying of the concrete foundations of the bridge.

In many cases they have lost their money.Onward flights booked with a second airline, will likely go ahead and as a result the second airline is under no obligation to refund you.The better, more expensive travel insurance policies offer “travel disruption cover”, which can pay for such losses – typically up to £3,000 per passenger, so check your policy’s small print. Business travel insurance invariably covers this.Meanwhile, Flybe passengers left stranded on Thursday should, in the first instance, contact their bank card provider. Card providers may be able to process a chargeback to recoup the fare they paid and have lost.Those whose bookings cost more than £100, and who paid by credit card, should be refunded in full by their card provider, under the section 75 rules that protect consumers.Anyone buying travel insurance in the current climate is strongly advised to buy a policy with SAF, and ideally “travel disruption cover”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ae90602675ec8fe3537c37b172c3927e061ee3/0_293_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61e76e396a5e59846715c0017113edab","title":"coronavirus minister hints u turn decision stop daily uk updates","story":"Chief medical officer admits ‘communications fumble’ over providing data on virus spreadThe government has reversed a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the coronavirus, as England’s chief medical officer admitted a “communications fumble”.But on Thursday morning Prof Chris Whitty announced a U-turn, saying the government would provide daily updates but they would be delayed by 24 hours to allow time for information to be verified.Speaking to the Commons health committee he said: “I think we had a bit of a communications fumble on this one. We are intending to provide geographical information.“We are intending to have some delay of about 24 hours to be absolutely sure we’ve got the details right. I think we do intend to continue with these geographical things. And in fact, in due course, will use maps and other things to enhance that.”Whitty also said the UK has mainly moved into the “delay phase” of tackling the virus, meaning measures to tackle the disease would be stepped up.He said: “We have moved from a situation where we are mainly in ‘contain’, with some ‘delay’ built in, to we are now mainly ‘delay’,” he said, although elements of the contain process remained in place.The government’s battle plan says of the “delay” phase: “Action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies (such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings) to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, while ensuring the country’s ability to continue to run as normally as possible.”“If you are missing all the mild cases, all the asymptomatic cases, you end up with an exaggerated view of what the mortality rate is.”Older people who may be more vulnerable should not isolate themselves at this stage of the UK epidemic, he said, although they may be advised to do so when the peak comes. If they cut themselves off too soon, they may suffer loneliness and have difficulties getting food and other supplies they need.The UK has effectively already moved into the second stage of its response – the delay phase – he said, which implies acceptance that the epidemic will come and can no longer be contained to a few cases and stamped out. The objective now was to track down every case and their contacts and isolate them so that it spreads more slowly and the peak comes later.That buys time for the trials of anti-viral drugs currently being tested in China – principally Kaletra, which is an HIV drug, and remdesivir, which was tried and failed against the Ebola virus. Whitty said he thought they could prove useful, if only for those people with severe illness. Delay into the summer months also may reduce the intensity of the epidemic, because people open windows and go outdoors, where they are much less likely to get infected. The virus spreads at close quarters, as it did in the ski chalet in France where the first British people were infected.Whitty said the virus spreads in water droplets when people cough and also on surfaces. In a tube train, he said, the virus from the hand of somebody who is infected might last on a rail for 48 or even 72 hours. But it would only be transmitted to another passenger if they touched the rail and then put their hand to their eyes, nose or mouth, which is why handwashing, preferably with soap and water, and not touching the face are the best protective measures anyone can take.If at the peak, the epidemic hits the top end of the range, “there will be a period when the NHS has great pressure on it for a brief period of time”. He thought recently retired doctors and nurses could volunteer to help in the event of inevitable staff shortages, but not necessarily in patient-facing roles. They could staff the NHS 111 call service, for instance.Closing schools, he said, would not necessarily be helpful. Children would mix anyway and it would mean some parents unable to work, with impact on the economy. It is also known from China that children are far less likely to get the virus than adults.He stressed that the UK would get through this: “There will be a beginning, a middle and an end.” No vaccine would be ready for at least a year, but would be useful for the future if the disease became endemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb4f60beaf02c889cc43c587626dacdf961d7639/505_975_6561_3937/master/6561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=251433f3cb61be81b5ae741679f73530","title":"have you recovered from the coronavirus","story":"If you have been tested positive for the virus and have since recovered, we would like to hear about your experienceWe’d like to hear from people who have tested positive for coronavirus but have since recovered.Did you have to self-isolate at home?

But at what cost to the environment?In the low-lying Gelderse Valley some 85km east of Amsterdam, a Dutch university is changing how humans eat.There, a bright-eyed press officer with Willy Wonka flair is showing me the miracles of modern food science. One laboratory door swings open to reveal giant, fragrant basil leaves growing under multicoloured lights. In a greenhouse nearby, thousands of tomatoes are suspended mid-air like plump, levitating Buddhas. A few steps away, I shake hands with a world-famous banana scientist, who dreams of introducing Europeans to the many varieties of banana eaten across Asia, Africa and Latin America, and ending the tyranny of the common yellow Cavendish.For miles in every direction, fields bulge with crops in some, drones monitor soil fertility, in others, giant luminescent panels light up greenhouses at night. The press officer is accustomed to impressing visitors. “What do you think?” he asks at every turn.The Netherlands is not a big place. You can drive across the whole country from the north to the south in under four hours. And yet it ranks consistently among the world’s top food exporting nations, in terms of gross value. The country’s surpluses are mind-boggling how does the second largest exporter of tomatoes and onions also produce such outsize quantities of dairy and potatoes, and export more eggs than any nation on Earth? The mystery of how this tiny patch of northern Europe does it draws government delegations, multinational companies and agriculture students from around the world to marvel at the nucleus of the Dutch innovation juggernaut: Wageningen University.Broadly speaking, humankind has two paths to choose from to confront what is about to happen. One option – we innovate our way out. Wageningen’s science addresses some of the biggest problems in our food supply system today: scientists there are developing plant-based meat, vertical farms and gene-editing technology. If the answer to the problem of humanity’s survival is going to come out of a laboratory, there’s a good chance that it will happen in Wageningen. Multinational companies and energetic startups are pouring money into the university the collective brainpower of 8,000 international food scientists is part of the machinery that will determine how humans of the future will eat.Louise Fresco, one of the world’s leading food scientists and president of Wageningen University, has been thinking about how to feed the world since she was 15 years old. In 1967, the budding scientist saw photographs of a famine in Biafra, Nigeria, and awakened to the urgency of global hunger. The images set Fresco off on journeys to Papua New Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where she witnessed scarcity first-hand – in her book, Hamburgers in Paradise, she recalls eating roasted palm beetles and python in tomato sauce on these trips to poverty-stricken countries. “I contemplated how little was available to the world’s population,” she writes.Fresco was born in the aftermath of one of the most traumatic chapters in modern Dutch history, a manmade famine known as the Hunger Winter during the second world war in which about 20,000 Dutch people starved to death in a few months, as wartime rations in some regions fell to 500 calories per day. The echo of this event, encapsulated in the postwar slogan: “hunger – never again”, reverberates through my conversation with Fresco, and through many conversations I have at Wageningen. “I always felt that the coincidence of birth should be translated into some kind of a moral responsibility,” Fresco says in an interview at her office. “There was a great sense that something had to be done, that there is more than just going about your own life and being rich and happy.”The Dutch obsession with agricultural surplus is at the heart of the story of Europe. In the years after the war, the Netherlands’ agriculture minister Sicco Mansholt piloted large-scale mechanised farming. Mansholt wanted to secure the country’s food supply by increasing production. Heavy machinery, chemical fertilisers, and new research and technology were part of a modernising mission that Mansholt later evangelised across the continent as the first European commissioner for agriculture through the common agricultural policy. He sought to build a postwar Europe of plenty while lifting small farmers out of poverty and integrating Europe’s economies.Public opinion turned against Europe’s state-sponsored excesses, in favour of efficiency-driven American capitalism. Wageningen was suffering an existential crisis. “There was a questioning (sic) of – should we take responsibility, shouldn’t the market do things?” said Fresco, who at the time was a rising star at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and would have been aware of the waste mountains and the first international conversations about sustainability. Wageningen’s establishment turned to the giants of industry to keep the university afloat.Walking around Wageningen with Fresco, I am struck at how the town has compartmentalised the angst and suffering of the war in a small museum in its cobbled old quarter. The futuristic Wageningen next door is unsentimental and solution-focused. Its glossy, modernist buildings architecturally distance the lingering emotion of Europe’s history, and invite in only reason and logic. Big money propels Wageningen’s new swagger. Sleek corporate buildings of companies such as Unilever and Dutch dairy giant FrieslandCampina blend seamlessly into the campus architecture and the old university town has rebranded as “Food Valley” – a shiny agri-tech mecca with one big goal: shaping the future of food.This mission-driven Wageningen is providing dazzling solutions to humanity’s impending food supply problem. As an example, one of the university’s star scientists Leo Marcellis is pioneering new vertical farming techniques as a possible solution to producing more food without using more land. Marcellis grows plants in tiered shelves inside highly monitored labs. The potential of this innovation is immense, he says, conjuring skyscrapers of herbs and abandoned buildings stacked with vegetable farms. But there is a small-print environmental cost attached, Marcellis admits. His vertical farms require huge inputs of artificial light, and are partially funded by Phillips, the lightbulb manufacturer. Marcellis’ land-saving vertical farms, it emerges, will require quite a lot of lightbulbs.The close relationship between Wageningen scientists and industry makes many people uncomfortable. Dutch investigative journalist Vincent Harmsen from One World magazine recently went to court asking Wageningen to release information about scientists’ communications with Syngenta, Monsanto and Bayer, large agrochemical firms. The university denied his freedom of information request, and a court upheld the university’s right to do so, on the grounds that Wageningen University’s funding is partially private. But without understanding the relationships between scientists and companies, Harmsen argues, it is impossible to discern scientific fact from company-sponsored fiction.This proximity between science and industry goes all the way to the top of the Wageningen pyramid. Fresco is a paid non-executive director of the multinational Syngenta. She previously held positions at Unilever and Dutch financial firm Rabobank. She argues that collaboration between private companies and science is necessary, and can be positive. Her role at Syngenta, she says, involves advising the company about sustainability. “Syngenta is not influencing Wageningen. It is contracting me, who tries to bring some good ideas to Syngenta. We work with all kinds of industry because we fundamentally believe that these big companies have such an influence in the world that they need to be helped to formulate sustainable products and ideas.”Meanwhile, on an abandoned apple orchard in Wageningen, a handful of students are planting a forest.In it, they will grow pumpkins, walnuts and berries. The aim is to demonstrate that small-scale farming is viable and more environmentally friendly than industrial mega-farms. “Louise Fresco still thinks quite a lot in terms of ‘we have to feed the world’,” says Louise Vercruysse, one of the students planting the farm. “I’m not really into that. You have to first look at why the world can’t feed itself.”The young Wageningeners believe that profit-seeking industrial farming has driven the planet to the edge of crisis. The Netherlands’ fantastical food production messaging has hidden modern agriculture’s assault on the environment for years, says Vercryusse. Dutch bees and butterflies are vanishing at astonishing speed, while Dutch children are suffering from pollution-induced asthma at rates higher than any country on the continent. Nitrogen levels, caused in part by hyperproductive Dutch dairy farms, when mapped from space resemble a wound over the country. To combat emissions, in 2019 Dutch courts delayed 18,000 construction projects and cut the national speed limit.The activist students say Wageningen’s curriculum is still prioritising industry over the environment. To introduce new ideas to her peers, student Eva van Dijk, organises lunchtime lectures by Wouter van Eck and champions forest farming – where food is foraged or cultivated in ecologically erse forest ecosystems.Far from feeding the world – Van Eck tells the students, European colonisers destroyed the world’s indigenous food production systems. Eighteenth-century Europeans did not recognise the indigenous plants of the Americas, seeing instead only timber forests that needed felling. Now, he says, Europe is trying to export its broken agriculture system to solve a hunger crisis it created.Van Eck argues that the calculations used to bump the Netherlands up in the export rankings are misleading. They are based on the monetary value of exports rather than the quantity or nutritional value of the produce. The Dutch dairy industry, for example, buys huge amounts of fodder from Brazil, using up farmland that could be used to grow food for Brazil’s native population. To Van Eck, the idea that the Netherlands’ surpluses feed the world, is a hollow and dangerous lie. “The Netherlands is a black hole for food production,” he says. “Wageningen is not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.”Van Eck gets a rockstar reception from the auditorium full of students attending the lecture. A number of them surround him at the end to examine the baskets of forest-grown fruit and herbs he has brought along and ask him if they can organise internships at his forest farm.Activist students at Wageningen organise underground seed exchanges, encouraging farmers to bypass the highly regulated, industry-dominated seed market. Some organise events where they throw seed “bombs” into parks and fields to break the monotony of the Netherlands’ controlled green spaces.The students believe the rational response to ecological crisis is to produce and consume less, even if it causes an economic backslide. This idea is catching fire around the world. Economists like Giorgos Kallis who champion “degrowth”, say western economies have achieved an optimal state, and should stop chasing GDP-driven yearly growth and focus instead on limiting environmental damage. At last year’s UN Climate Action Summit in New York, Greta Thunberg rebuked world leaders for continuing to pursue economic rather than ecological goals. “You are failing us,” she said.The young Wageningeners are aware that they will live through an era of environmental calamity that will shape their entire lives. Their university years lack outward signs of frivolous indulgence and instead are characterised by astounding personal choices. At Droevendaal, an ecological complex near the university, Van Dijk tells me the students bulk order organic produce like cereal and rice and share it between houses to keep costs low. Their primary mode of transport is cycling. They spend their spare time cultivating vegetable patches in their gardens and eat omelettes made from fresh eggs from chickens roaming the area. Solar panels provide their energy. Unwanted clothes, books and scrap are traded in a shed called the “Giveawayshop” to minimise waste.The students’ ideas, though, are untested. Van Eck admits in his lecture that his technique of farming is still a pilot project, and that he is not advocating for all farmers to turn their fields into forests. Scientists have raised questions about other alternative farming methods in the past. Many argue, for example, that some organic fertilisers and pesticides, though natural, can be harmful to the environment. Plus, lower yields on organic farms could mean having to use more land – which could lead to further deforestation.Disrupting food supply chains runs huge socio-economic risks, threatening millions of livelihoods around the world. In February, thousands of farmers in angry tractor convoys protested at The Hague, where parliament sits, fearing that debates about the environmental impact of Dutch agriculture could wipe out their businesses.On the apple orchard, the students agree that their experiments are only a starting point for the questions facing humanity. “I am still figuring out what I think the ideal path is,” said one, as I was leaving. “One thing is clear. The system we have now is not going to feed the planet without completely destroying the Earth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e269a173d15dfac3a0e2c7bf5131f266129ba88/0_29_2322_1393/master/2322.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a30077effdd744ea7f9925cd860328c0","title":"hsbc evacuates floor of canary wharf after coronavirus test","story":"Employee’s diagnosis prompts deep clean as firms outline contingency plans for staff to work at homeHSBC has evacuated a floor of its Canary Wharf office tower after an employee was confirmed to have caught coronavirus.The bank has sent 100 people home and ordered a deep clean of the 10th floor, which houses its research department. This has so far not affected HSBC’s trading floor, which carries out large transactions on financial markets for big institutions.HSBC said: “We have been informed that one of our employees at 8 Canada Square has been diagnosed with Covid-19. This colleague is under medical supervision and has self-isolated. We are working closely with the health authorities.“We are deep-cleaning the floor where our colleague worked and shared areas of the building.

Our first priority and concern is the health of our employees and customers – and we are encouraging our colleagues to monitor their health carefully and stay at home or call a doctor if they feel unwell.”About 20 people were sent home from the global banking ision on the second floor of the HSBC tower on Wednesday, after an employee had contact with someone who subsequently developed coronavirus symptoms, according to a person familiar with the matter. HSBC has also banned all non-essential travel. The floor evacuation was first reported by Financial News.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Other companies are also making plans to send staff home, if the epidemic escalates. Tesco on Wednesday told more than 5,000 staff at its Welwyn Garden City headquarters in Hertfordshire and other offices to prepare to work from home.Lloyd’s of London, the world’s biggest insurance market, this week announced “emergency trading protocols” to allow the market to remain open if the situation escalates. Lloyd’s 1,000 staff, along with thousands of brokers and underwriters who work for other firms, would be asked to work from home and to resort to electronic trading.Britain’s financial services regulator said on Wednesday it has “no objection” in principle to City staff working remotely due to coronavirus quarantine measures.However, the Financial Conduct Authority said firms must take all reasonable steps to keep operating effectively and support their customers.The FCA said: “For example, we would expect firms to be able to enter orders and transactions promptly into the relevant systems, use recorded lines when trading and give staff access to the compliance support they need. If firms are able to meet these standards and undertake these activities from backup sites or with staff working from home, we have no objection to this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baa9a195e26c7be04f96f650b905e875939c4392/0_331_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=440006112890d76a5403ef7a2cdf2a8c","title":"iran to restrict travel between cities as 3500 catch coronavirus","story":"Cases detected in Greece among people returning from Middle East, as Iran limits travel within countryGreece has become the latest country to try to halt the spread of the coronavirus by closing schools and universities and cancelling large public gatherings, as the World Health Organization insisted the virus could still be “pushed back” if governments around the world took the necessary action.On Thursday, Greece followed Iran and Italy’s lead by shuttering educational institutions and cancelling sports events and other public gatherings in three western regions.Infections from the virus in Greece have reached 31, but a health ministry official said it expected a significant rise in cases in the coming weeks. Twenty-one new Greek cases were detected among travellers who had recently returned from Israel and Egypt.The national public health organisation said the two-day shutdown included “a suspension of all mass gatherings” at theatres, cinemas, museums and sports events in the Peloponnese regions of Achaia and Elis and the island of Zakynthos.Ancient Olympia, where the flame for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is scheduled to be lit on 12 March, is situated in Elis. The Greek Olympic committee said it was drastically scaling back accreditations “to those absolutely necessary”, limiting festivities and cancelling all event dinners and galas.Greece’s precautionary measures came as Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO, said countries should be preparing for sustained community transmission and called for governments to play their part in stopping the spread of the coronavirus within their own borders.Tedros said: “Our message to all countries is: this is not a one-way street. We can push this virus back. Your actions now will determine the course of the outbreak in your country.”Iran said it would begin erecting checkpoints to limit travel between major cities and has urged people to reduce their use of paper banknotes as authorities scramble to contain the coronavirus, which has caused at least 107 deaths and infected more than 3,500 people across the country.The Iranian health minister, Saeed Namaki, announced the drastic new measures during a televised press conference on Thursday, adding that schools and universities would remain closed until Nowruz, the Persian new year, on 20 March.Namaki told people to stay in their vehicles at petrol stations and allow attendants to fill their tanks to avoid the spread of the virus.Iran and Italy have the world’s highest death tolls outside China, where the outbreak began at the end of last year. So far, the virus has infected 95,000 people worldwide and killed more than 3,200.The Italian government on Wednesday ordered the closure of all schools and universities after the virus spread to all but one of its 20 regions, killing 107 people.It also confirmed that all major sporting events, including Serie A football, would be played behind closed doors due to the outbreak, until 3 April.South Africa on Thursday became the latest country to confirm its first case of the coronavirus, which was linked to Italy: a 38-year-old man who had travelled to the country with his wife in a group of 10 people.The group returned to South Africa on 1 March and the man went to see a GP two days afterwards with symptoms including fever, headache, a sore throat and a cough.

A Palestinian official said four positive tests carried out locally were being sent to Israel for verification.Palestinian authorities said the Nativity church in Bethlehem, built over the spot where Christians believe Jesus was born, was among those places of worship closing indefinitely on Thursday over coronavirus fears.The Palestinian health ministry said it was preventing all tourists from entering the West Bank but did not specify for how long.On Thursday, the German airline group Lufthansa cancelled all flights to Israel until 28 March after Israeli authorities barred entry to almost all non-resident arrivals from five European nations, including Germany, over coronavirus fears.“The Lufthansa group sees itself forced to make this cancellation for economic and operational reasons, as many passengers are no longer entitled to enter the country,” the group said in a statement.On Wednesday, Israel denied entry to almost all non-residents of the country arriving from France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland. It also ordered citizens and Israeli residents from the same countries into quarantine.Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates warned its citizens and foreign residents not to travel, and sent the 215 foreigners it evacuated from Hubei in China to a quarantine centre set up in a humanitarian hub in the capital, Abu Dhabi.The UAE is home to Emirates, the government-owned airline based at Dubai international airport, the world’s busiest for international travel. Abu Dhabi is also home to Etihad, the country’s national carrier. Both airlines have encouraged staff to take time off as international travel has dropped due to the virus.The coronavirus outbreak has already had a dramatic effect on Islamic worship in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia banning its citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca, and Iran cancelling Friday prayers in major cities.South Korea’s infection toll neared 6,000 on Thursday, while there were a further 31 virus deaths in Hubei province in China, where the outbreak began, and authorities confirmed 139 new cases – a rise on the previous day’s total.In the US, California declared a state of emergency over its 53 confirmed cases, and a cruise ship linked to the state’s first virus death was being held off the coast of San Francisco.Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c77d895199a158364b8c20403fe17a1b373d63/0_120_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2b1fd4fef9a3035435ce5ec863487f3","title":"italys ex pm silvio berlusconi splits from partner of 12 years","story":"Twice orced media magnate reportedly now dating Marta Fascina, an MP from his partyItaly’s former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has split from his partner after a 12-year relationship, his Forza Italia party said.The 83-year-old billionaire and 34-year-old Francesca Pascale will “remain friends”, Forza Italia said in a statement.Pascale, who once said in an interview that she asked Berlusconi to marry her every day, appeared to have been caught off guard, saying she was “astonished” by the statement, according to the Repubblica paper.“I will hold him dear for ever. I wish him all the happiness in the world and hope he finds someone who will take care of him as I have,” she said.The twice orced media magnate, whose domination of Italian politics for more than two decades despite sex scandals, serial gaffes and legal woes earned him the nickname “the immortal”, is reportedly dating 30-year-old Marta Fascina, an MP from his party.Berlusconi was sentenced in 2013 to seven years in jail for paying for sex with a 17-year-old, though that conviction was later overturned.Rumours have been swirling in the gossip media for a while over his relationship with Fascina. But once paparazzi pictures emerged of the ex-premier and Fascina leaving a hotel in Switzerland walking Pascale’s dog, the secret was out.Italian media had reported back in 2014 that Pascale bought a wedding dress to celebrate Berlusconi’s orce from his second wife, Veronica Lario.

Instead, they say, things are getting worseby  Tom Phillips in Mexico CityEach day, María Salguero’s inbox floods with alerts telling the interminable tale of Mexico’s femicide crisis: “woman’s corpse”, “woman dismembered”, “woman stoned”, “woman stabbed”.For the past four years the Mexico City activist has made a daily mission of documenting the death toll, and pinpointing each of the crimes and victims on an online map.When Andrés Manuel López Obrador was elected in 2018, Salguero hoped Mexico’s supposedly progressive new president would take decisive action to slow a wave of killing that last year claimed the lives of 3,825 women.Instead, Salguero’s research tells her things are getting worse: 10 or 11 women are now being killed each day, compared to six when she launched her map in 2016.And – like many Mexican feminists – she voices frustration at the politician popularly known as Amlo.“I feel betrayed, because I was one of those who voted for him,” said Salguero, 40. “We trusted that things could be different – but now we are seeing that this is just more of the same.”Salguero is not alone.After a politically explosive start to 2020, in which two horrific femicides sparked street protests and catapulted gender violence to the top of Mexico’s political agenda, many former Amlo supporters are expressing disenchantment.Masked feminists daubed their discontent on to the presidential palace last month with slogans such as “Amlo is killing us” and “Let’s abort Amlo”.“We all believed that with him things would be different. I thought this too,” said Frida Guerrera, a journalist and activist who recently confronted Mexico’s president at his morning press conference.Microphone in hand, Guerrera implored Amlo to do more to fight Mexico’s “femicide emergency”.Guerrera – who tells the stories of femicide victims on her blog - insisted she had not intended to pick a fight with Amlo.“I’m not Andrés Manuel’s enemy,” she said. “I went because I don’t want to write any more stories - and because I truly believe we must treat this as a national emergency – and they do not want to accept this.”But Amlo’s reaction did nothing to reassure Guerrera, or other women’s rights activists who believe the president’s response to the crisis has been haughty and evasive.Amlo has enraged feminist activists by insinuating a nationwide women’s strike on 9 March was part of a conservative plot against his government and announcing he would inaugurate a populist raffle for his presidential plane on the very same day. (On Wednesady he announced he would postpone the launch, saying he “didn’t even realize” that the strike was planned for Monday.)In another particularly notorious declaration, he attributed femicide to the “neoliberal policies” of previous administrations.Political scientist Viridiana Ríos said she thought criticism of Amlo’s linking of neoliberal policies with femicide was mistaken.But Ríos believed Amlo’s handling of the crisis had been damaging and counterproductive and stemmed partly from a conviction that the feminist movement was a political threat.“He is now really empowering the opposition, and more critically he is perceived as insensitive,” Ríos said. “What could be worse for a leftwing politician than to be perceived as socially insensitive?”As the killing continues, activists such Salguero and Guerrera busy themselves fighting to give femicide victims a voice.Each weekday, Salguero spends up to four hours up tapping details of the latest murders into her laptop. So far this year she has logged 320 deaths. Since launching her map in January 2016 there have been more than 9,000At the weekend, Salguero tries to forget: going bike riding, posting photos of cats and dogs on Facebook or listening to Norwegian black metal to relax.“This is how I get rid of all the stress of all this violence. Otherwise I would go mad,” she said.At first Salguero recorded only basic details of each murder but increasingly she tries to add “context” – the key, she thinks, to finding policy solutions that can stop the slaughter.How was the woman killed? Why? Was she pregnant? Was she alone? Was she raped? Was she thrown from a vehicle or dumped on a wasteland? Was the victim found clothed or naked? What kind of gun was used? How many knife wounds did she suffer?“Sometimes you see victims who have been stabbed more than 100 times,” Salguero said. “Just imagine that level of viciousness. It just show you how much rage these men feel towards women.”This year, as the femicide crisis has turned into a major political row, she and Guerrera have been targeted on social media. Salguero said some of the most venomous attacks came after she published the tally of women killed since Amlo took office in December 2018: 3,835.“They went for my jugular,” Salguero said.But she shrugged off such attacks and vowed not to abandon her map.“If the president plays down the problem then what can you expect from the rest of society? I feel that if I don’t do something then it could be my nieces next. It could happen to any one of the women around me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/200f6fb45caeeeb890ce0963eebde00dcac0854b/0_181_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af1061eeda7da8ca768a60972a655965","title":"more than a hundred people in uk infected with coronavirus","story":"Number of cases rises to 115 as 25 more people in England test positiveThe number of coronavirus cases in the UK has surged to 115, with at least eight of the new patients infected without having gone abroad, the Department of Health and Social Care has said.The figure is an increase of 30 from Wednesday, and includes a further 25 people in England as well as previously reported cases in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. A total of 18,083 people in the UK have now been tested and Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said the virus was “likely to spread significantly”.The government also provided a regional breakdown of where all the cases are located, after reversing a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the disease.The U-turn came after Wednesday’s decision prompted accusations of secrecy and concerns that it would lead to the spread of fake news.England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, announced the reinstatement of daily location updates and admitted a “communication fumble” on the issue.• Twenty-five cases of coronavirus are in London. It comes as more than 100 staff from HSBC’s research department were sent home from the 45-floor skyscraper in Canary Wharf while a section of the trading floor was also cleared out.• Two more cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Liverpool. A spokesman for the city council said one was in contact with an existing patient and the other has recently returned from Italy.• Wales’ chief medical officer said a second patient has been identified in the country and is not believed to be linked to the first Welsh patient. They had recently travelled to Italy.• The first West Midlands case was also confirmed by health officials. Public Health England (PHE) says a patient in Birmingham has tested positive.• The spread of coronavirus means it is likely Premier League matches will be played behind closed doors this month, a leading club executive has admitted.Thursday’s update came after Whitty warned that there could be intense pressure for critical care beds in the NHS during an epidemic. He told MPs the UK had now mainly moved into the “delay phase” of tackling the virus.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Johnson’s spokesperson warned the coronavirus was likely to spread significantly. The prime minister was updated on the coronavirus by the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser as he opened an official Cobra meeting.“We will continue to try to contain this virus. However it’s now highly likely that the virus is going to spread in a significant way.“Officials will therefore accelerate work on preparations for the delay phase of the government’s plan focusing on steps we can take to seek to delay the spread of the virus,” the spokesperson said.Three new cases were confirmed in Scotland. The country’s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said the new Scottish patients are from the Forth Valley, Greater Glasgow \u0026amp Clyde, and Grampian areas. All of them tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, after coming into contact with others who already had the virus.The spread of coronavirus means it is likely Premier League matches will be played behind closed doors this month. Sasha Ryazantsev, Everton’s chief financial officer, said banning fans from matches in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus would be a decision “forced” on clubs.She said: “It would be a forced decision rather than one we would proactively engage in … But the whole situation goes far beyond the world of sport. Of course nobody wants to play behind closed doors and I don’t think it’s inevitable at the moment that it will happen. But we feel it is quite likely it may happen in the coming weeks.”On Thursday, HSBC was forced to evacuate a floor of its Canary Wharf office tower after an employee was confirmed to have caught coronavirus. The bank sent 100 people home and ordered a deep clean of the 10th floor, which houses its research department. This has so far not affected HSBC’s trading floor, which carries out large transactions on financial markets for big institutions.HSBC said: “We have been informed that one of our employees at 8 Canada Square has been diagnosed with Covid-19. This colleague is under medical supervision and has self-isolated. We are working closely with the health authorities.“We are deep-cleaning the floor where our colleague worked and shared areas of the building. Colleagues on that floor, and others who came into contact with him, have been advised to work at home. Based on medical and official advice the building remains open and operates as normal. Our first priority and concern is the health of our employees and customers – and we are encouraging our colleagues to monitor their health carefully and stay at home or call a doctor if they feel unwell.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce3753b2ea2c3621e06aa40fc69c5a179b8ef5ca/779_64_4933_2960/master/4933.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a0a6315d58b61a6ecbc492dca5d276","title":"really stressful italians struggle to cope with education closures","story":"Parents having to use paid leave to stay at home after decision, disputed by some expertsStudents, parents and teachers are struggling to cope with the Italian government’s decision to close all schools and universities nationwide until 15 March as it grapples to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of coronavirus. The virus had claimed 148 lives in the country by Thursday evening, according to government figures.“It is not easy,” said Maurizio Bufalini, 45, who works at a court in Ferrara, in Emilia-Romagna. “My wife and I had to use our holidays and paid leave to stay at home with our little daughter. I hope the government will intervene soon, otherwise it will be a disaster.”Schools were already closed in the northern regions worst affected by the outbreak, including Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont and Friuli Venezia Giulia, as well as parts of Liguria and Marche, but on Thursday the closures were rolled out across the country in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.“I have two children and the little one attends a private kindergarden which is not going to refund the monthly fee,’’ said Rosamaria Battaglia, 33, who works at a nautical agency in Palermo.“This week we’ll get a babysitter, but hopefully next week we’ll find a more economic solution. Being a mother and a worker in Italy is hard, being a mother and a worker in Italy during the outbreak of Covid-19 is really stressful.”The government has announced it is making €7.5bn available to help families and companies and is evaluating the possibility of providing support to families, including reimbursements for childcare costs and unpaid leave from work.“We should not assume that people are home using up holiday pay or paid leave,” Elena Bonetti, the minister for equal opportunities and family, told Radio Capital.Some experts and scientists have disagreed with the decision to close all schools. An authoritative source at the Italian Scientific Committee told La Stampa that the government’s decision was “evaluated as void of scientific evidence and above all with limited effectiveness if not carried out over time”.The government says it has the support of the scientific community and has the evidence to prove it. Many teachers and lecturers are continuing to teach students online.The problems are not only affecting parents, but students as well, especially university students who were poised to graduate in March.Roberta Bivona, 27, a literature student at the University of Palermo, was scheduled to meet a panel of professors to discuss her honours thesis on 11 March.“At first they informed me that my thesis defence would take place without observers, who are normally present as audience members,” Bivona said. “Now everything has changed with the closure of universities. Yesterday we received an email from the university rector, who is considering the possibility of thesis defences via Skype.”It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.UK Chief Medical Officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland\u0026nbspChina, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and who is experiencing a cough or fever or shortness of breath to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 4 March, the\u0026nbspglobal death toll was 3,190, while\u0026nbspmore than 93,000 people have been infected\u0026nbspin more than 80 countries.The death toll has passed 3,000 in China, where there have been over 80,000 cases. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 5,328 cases. More than 44,000 people in\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbsphave recovered from Covid-19.There have been 87 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK. There are 53 confirmed cases in Australia, with two deaths.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed outside China, but by no means in all 195 countries on the WHO’s list. It is also not spreading within those countries at the moment, except in a very few cases. By far the majority of cases are travellers who picked up the virus in China.No. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has\u0026nbspdeclared the outbreak to be a public health emergency\u0026nbspof international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children.University academics are also struggling to cope with the closures.James Schwarten, an American university lecturer based in Rome, acknowledges the hardships the situation has created. “The coronavirus outbreak has generated a stressful predicament for university institutions that accommodate US study-abroad students, not to mention for university professors,’’ he said. ‘’This adverse situation has created a general climate of uncertainty as many students have already returned to the US, as well as concern for student enrolments in summer and fall, which could be negatively affected. If that scenario is borne out, many adjunct faculty members could find themselves in severe financial straits.”In the province of Vo’Euganeo, the first to be placed in the red zone, schools have been dealing with closures for the last 15 days.A school in Lozzo Atestino, in the province of Padua and in the red zone, has been using remote online learning tools in place of classroom teaching.“We had to do something,” said Alfonso D’Ambrosio, the headmaster. “The education minister sent us 25 tablets for needy students. We are moving forward with our classes with excellent results … Our curriculum is important, but even more so now is to communicate to the students that the school is their ally. Some of the children’s parents have tested positive for the virus, and at this time we felt the need to support them.”Many experts have offered to help with the remote lessons, including Luca Vullo, who volunteered to hold classes on emotional intelligence for pupils in Lozzo Atestino. “When I learned of this opportunity, I was compelled to participate voluntarily,” said Vullo, a theatre director, actor and coach. “These are important topics in this precise moment, in which it is necessary to interpret and understand our emotions and our body.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1990742910aca3ee5d56cb27c2fbd76d9c377aba/0_109_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=899228314e1d69b109a44cae513944a8","title":"turkey deploys special forces as tensions rise along greek border","story":"Ankara claims scores of people trying to enter Greece have been injured by guardsTensions along Greece’s land border with Turkey have erupted again, barely 48 hours after European Union chiefs visited the region, as thousands of people, reportedly goaded by Turkish authorities, regrouped in the area.Ankara announced it was deploying 1,000 police special forces along the frontier on Thursday, claiming scores of people had been injured by Greek guards trying to stop them from crossing into the country.“They wounded 164 people. They tried to push 4,900 back to Turkey,” the country’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, told reporters after taking a helicopter tour of the Evros region. “We are deploying 1,000 special force police … to prevent the pushbacks.”Ankara has accused Athens of resorting to increasingly aggressive measures to deter migrants and refugees from breaching the frontier, following its abrupt decision to no longer abide by a landmark 2016 accord to halt migratory flows to the EU.In what has become as much a war of words as nerves, the neighbours – both Nato members but longstanding regional rivals – have exchanged barbs over the extent to which force has been used since Turkey declared it was “opening the doors” to Europe.Earlier this week, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said Greek forces were firing on defenceless migrants trying to enter the EU state and had shot one man dead, an accusation deplored as “fake news” by the centre-right government in Athens.The deployment of special police comes after the administration of the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, also rushed to reinforce Greece’s land and sea frontiers with elite troops.On Wednesday, Greek riot police fired warning shots, teargas and water cannon to keep thousands of people from traversing the frontier, amid accusations of Turkish forces also firing many rounds of teargas into Greece. Authorities in Athens announced that about 7,000 illegal entries had been rebuffed overnight.The man often cited as the intellectual architect of the 2106 deal said on Thursday that European leaders had made a “capital error” by neglecting to commit to future payments towards the informal arrangement with Erdoğan’s government.“We need a new deal with Turkey,” said Gerald Knaus, who heads a small migration-focused thinktank.The pact had worked for the last four years, Knaus said, because Erdoğan needed the €6bn (£5.2bn) the EU had committed to the arrangement. But member states had become complacent about the arrangement and failed to sufficiently raise the need for further funds during recent budget talks in the European council, he said. “We’ve put off the decision for four years.”Knaus said suspending asylum claims on the Greek border risked undermining the fundamental rights that the EU claims to be built upon. “If Greece can suspend the right to asylum, what stops Hungary from suspending the next basic right? Viktor Orbán saw in the refugee crisis a great opportunity to end the era of human rights, and we risk proving him right.”The tensions flared as Erdoğan prepared to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow in a last-ditch effort to hammer out a ceasefire in Syria and avoid further calamity in the northern province of Idlib, Syria’s last rebel-held enclave.Almost a million displaced citizens have moved into the area as the Assad regime, backed by Russia, has waged a merciless offensive against the province. Alarm over the prospect of yet more refugees piling into Turkey, already hosting 3.7 million Syrians, played a role in prompting Erdoğan to “open the doors” to Europe.With officials in Brussels fearing the crisis is far from over, Frontex, the EU’s border agency, is poised to dispatch hundreds of extra guards and monitoring equipment to strengthen the bloc’s external borders. More patrol boats are expected to be deployed to Greece’s eastern Aegean isles facing the Turkish coast, where about 150,000 men, women and children are thought to have amassed in the hope of entering the country.A flotilla of gunships and coastguard boats already in place around the isles has proven extraordinarily effective, with police in Lesbos reporting no new arrivals since Monday.At the height of the Syrian civil war in 2015, almost a million Syrian refugees crossed into Europe via Lesbos alone. An estimated 27,000 people are currently housed on the island following a big rise in arrivals. Most are housed in Moria, a camp now seven times over capacity and widely regarded as the worst refugee installation in the world.With local tensions running high, government officials confirmed on Thursday that a Greek naval carrier would transport about 508 people who had managed to reach Lesbos after Turkey’s about-face to the mainland. They will be held in a detention centre before being deported under new emergency measures introduced in response to what Mitsotakis has called an “asymmetric threat” to Greece’s national security."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d3dc70daac2378dc179cc8cf864c266637562ae/0_300_5954_3572/master/5954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fefb51f701d13ce93dfb1ae154c8fcd0","title":"coronavirus live updates italy germany pandemic europe uk us australia india update latest news","story":"Iran limits travel as 3,500 infected California declares state of emergency Italian doctors say German man may have been first European with virusThe Royal Berkshire NHS Trust has confirmed an older patient is the first to die from the coronavirus in the UK.The trust said in a statement:Sadly, we can confirm that an older patient with underlying health conditions has died.

In the past five years, heatwaves, Brexit, the weak pound, overseas terrorist attacks and, more recently, the climate crisis have all boosted UK holiday bookings. This year, coronavirus looks set to do the same as British travellers swap holidays abroad for a break closer to home.“January was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the traffic impacts we are seeing owing to the Covid-19 outbreak, given that major travel restrictions in China did not begin until 23 January. Nevertheless, it was still enough to cause our slowest traffic growth in nearly a decade,” said IATA chief executive Alexandre de Juniac.Prime minister Boris Johnson spokesperson warned the coronavirus was likely to spread significantly.

A healthcare professional in the west of Ireland is among the latest group of people to test positive for the coronavirus, the Irish Time reports.The person worked a shift in a hospital emergency department in Clare after returning from northern Italy. The healthcare professional was one of four people from the same family who tested positive for the disease on Wednesday evening.The chief medical officers from the different regions within the UK have responded to the latest figures on the coronavirus outbreak. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said:As of 9:00am this morning 25 further patients in England have tested positive for Covid-19.Seventeen were diagnosed who had recently travelled from recognised countries or from recognised clusters which were under investigation. Eight patients were identified in the UK where it is not yet clear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from an inidual who had recently returned from abroad. This is being investigated and contact tracing has begun.The total number of confirmed cases in England is now 105. Following previously reported confirmed cases in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, the total number of UK cases is 115.Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales, confirmed that a second patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus. He said: I can confirm that a second patient in Wales has tested positive for coronavirus.All appropriate measures to provide care for the inidual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are being taken.I can also confirm that like the first case in Wales, this patient had travelled back to Wales from northern Italy, where the virus was contracted.I’d like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents. Working with our partners in Wales and the UK, we have implemented our planned response, with robust infection control measures in place to protect the health of the public.The Scottish government has not raised the country’s coronavirus alert status from contain to delay, unlike health chiefs in England and Wales, because the number and type of Covid-19 cases are not yet significant enough.Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said on Thursday morning the number of confirmed cases in Scotland had doubled overnight to six after three people came into contact with the three previous Covid-19 patients.By 2pm on Thursday, there had been 1,250 negative tests according to the first bulletin in a series which ministers in Edinburgh said will be published at 2pm every day.Scottish government officials said there was not yet evidence in Scotland of community transmission involving patients not in direct contact with known carriers or a sufficiently high infection rate to raise the alert from its lowest status, containment, up a step to delay.The delay phase is focused on slowing the virus’s spread through the wider community, and could involve banning or delaying large scale public events, to buy time for medical supplies to be built up and reduce the risks of the coronavirus coinciding with the peak occurrence of routine winter illnesses.Officials said they expected that to change a matter of hours or days. “We’re under no illusion that it’s only a matter of a short period of time before we move it to ‘delay’,” said a government spokeswoman.The Department of Health confirmed that as of 9am on 5 March 2020, 18,083 people have been tested in the UK, of whom the tests came back negative for 17,968.Police in Northern Ireland may face 12-hour shifts and cancelled rest days if coronavirus has a serious impact on staffing levels, PA media reports.The chief constable of Police Service of Northern Ireland, Simon Byrne, said the potential impact of Covid-19 was very much unknown at this stage, but added that there were contingency plans in place if high numbers of his officers were struck down by the disease.“At the moment we are not complacent, and we can use a lot of experience from operating at pace at different times, whether it is dealing with complex investigations or serious disorder to keep officers and staff available to work,” he said.There are currently three cases in Northern Ireland.“The disease, whilst the dots on the map are increasing, hasn’t yet exploded into the country,” Byrne said. “We are following the advice about personal hygiene, clearly what I need to do with senior colleagues is make sure our preparedness is at its optimum, so we are looking at a range of scenario planning in terms of how we protect officers and staff.”The Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities until 15 March as it tries to tackle Europe’s worst outbreak of coronavirus. More than 3,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus in Italy, of whom 107 have diedTeachers and lecturers have turned to online classes to continue providing lessons to their students.

So you just can’t do that.”In London, there was some concern earlier that two patients at King’s College hospital in London may have contracted it while in the hospital.However, the  understands that both people were exposed to the virus before they reached the hospital.One of them is now being cared for in an isolation unit in St Thomas’ hospital in central London where a number of other infected people are being cared for.Staff at a British government department have received an unfortunately worded email offering help with planning their “demise”, the Daily Mirror reports.The message was sent to staff at the Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills (BEIS).The Mirror reports that the email was sent by a representative of ISS, an outsourcing company, and reads that it is monitoring the situation in relation to the coronavirus.“Should, as part of your preparations need us to consider something more specific to your demise, ISS are happy to do so,” the email adds."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"State exams body taking Department of Health advice over Junior and Leaving Cert\u0026lsquoIt is everyone\u0026rsquos responsibility to protect public health\u0026rsquo, HSE specialist saysTaoiseach reveals a Cabinet subcommittee has been established to address outbreakBreach of duty admitted in relation to operation at Bon Secours Hospital, GalwayThree schools closed after four test positive for Covid-19 and student nurses told to isolateGarda\u0026iacute investigate report a man called to a house claiming to work for the security firm\u0026lsquoWho is the leader of Sinn F\u0026eacutein?

Photographs: Aaron ChownPA WireTensions were high at the Salthill Knocknacarra GAA club in Galway on Thursday, as onlookers waited to see whether Team William or Team Catherine would be crowned winner of a hurling shoot out.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge concluded their three-day visit to Ireland with a trip to the Galway GAA club, where they received lessons on how to play the world’s fastest field sport.Fresh from a walk around Galway city where they celebrated its status as 2020 European Capital of Culture, the couple kicked, punched and hand-passed footballs during drills, in preparation of the royal rumble.Two teams of three were set up to see who could score the most points with a hurl and sliotar. Each player had two shots in the girls versus boys contest.Team William was comprised of the Duke, Devon Burke (10) and Oisin Morrissey (10), while Team Catherine featured the Duchess, Niamh McGauran (10) and Neasa Garvey (10).Prince William looked nervous as he sized up the hurl, moving it from hand to hand, as if measuring its weight.“Are you guys really good?” he asked his teammates. “Yes,” they both replied, unashamedly.“I’ve never done this before, I might need you to show me. I’ve played hockey but never this,” the prince replied, looking between the boys and the goal.The two boys said they wanted to win and the Prince laughed in response. “If I can hit one it would be good,” he replied with a smile.The Duchess also received advice from her teammates. “Keep your eye on the ball,” the kids shouted out to her, after she missed the sliotar.Their advice worked, too, as she quickly hit the next shot, with the sliotar soaring just above the crossbar.Final scoreIt was a close game, with both teams performing admirably, but ultimately Team Catherine came out on top with 4-1 to 3-1.The intensity wasn’t quite Davy Fitzgerald levels as both Cambridges cheered each other on when goals were scored. The Duchess put a hand of solidarity on her husband’s shoulder when he hit the post.Speaking after the couple had left, Devon said he was “disappointed” his team had lost but that it was “so much fun” to play.Niamh, who was on Team Catherine, said she would “love” if Kate Middleton was really on her team one day.“She asked me what my name was, and what age I was and she asked me how to hit the sliotar. We guided her through it and she got it right,” she said.The royal couple received a warm welcome in Galway, but particularly from the members of the club.The children formed a guard of honour for the pair, as they began to leave the club grounds, shaking hands with people as they went.Club secretary Conor McGauran said: “This is more than just symbolic, this is them playing our national sport, this is them getting involved in a community-based organisation that’s completely run by volunteerism, so to me it’s a huge message of support for Irish-British relations.”The excitement got too much for some of the children who had to be held back to prevent them from running after the royal couple.“Bring me,” one child called out. “Bring me with you.”The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge instead brought home three club jerseys for their children, a sliotar, a hurl and a football to commemorate the first time they played GAA.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4193895.1583414845!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit barnier says serious differences with uk after first round of talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier: “An agreement is possible, even if difficult,” he said in Brussels. Photograph: Francois WalschaertsAFP via Getty ImagesThere is “serious ergence” between Britain and the European Union on their future relationship, the bloc’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday after the first round of talks between the two sides on a new deal after Brexit.“An agreement is possible, even if difficult,” Mr Barnier also told journalists.The differences include robust provisions on the so-called level playing field which guarantees fair competition between EU and British companies after Brexit, he said.Another friction point is the fact that Britain wants a separate deal on fisheries to be renewed every year, something Mr Barnier called impractical.Mr Barnier said Britain’s negotiator David Frost had confirmed the UK would respect all its legal undertakings in the withdrawal agreement – including those relating to the Irish border. “This a condition for the trust that we need now to build our future partnership on a good basis,” he said. Mr Barnier added that London was seeking a series of separate deals, while the bloc wanted a one overarching agreement, which would also give the EU’s top court, the European Court of Justice, a final say on the interpretation of EU laws.He also said London refused to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr Barnier said there would be a “lot of consequences” if there was no agreement and the UK did not seek an extension to the transitional arrangements — something prime minister Boris Johnson has ruled out. “That has a lot of consequences that we have to prepare for. It will not be business as usual. It will be very, very different,” he said. “The definitive changes which will happen because of the decision of the United Kingdom and the difficulties which will be linked to that, my impression is they are very often underestimated.” – AgenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

We have porous borders and we believe that if the heat is turned up on the jihadists in Burkina Faso they will seek to regroup in Ghana.”Britain is already being drawn ever deeper into the Sahel crisis. It has deployed three heavy-lift Chinook helicopters and nearly 100 personnel to support France’s counterterrorist mission in the Sahel, a vast stretch of arid scrubland on the southern fringe of the Sahara. It will send 250 more to join the UN’s force in Mali in the coming months.But any jihadist infiltration into Ghana would raise pressure on Britain to play a much more decisive role in what has so far been a French-led response to the crisis.The three Sahelian states at the epicentre of the insurgency – Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso – are all former French colonies, as are three of the latter’s four southern neighbours. Until 1957 Ghana was the British colony of the Gold Coast.Just as in the Sahel, none of the Gulf of Guinea states are thought to be anywhere near ready to beat back Islamist groups that have carried out hundreds of attacks on military and civilian targets alike, killing thousands of people a year.Britain has taken a leading role, alongside France, the United States and Israel, in helping Ghana develop a special forces capability, the Ghanaian source said.Last week, British officers also joined Flintlock, an annual Pentagon-sponsored exercise to train 15 African armies in counterterrorism techniques.Given the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Sahel, where the number of attacks has increased five-fold since 2016, this year’s manoeuvres, held in the Senegalese town of Thies and in the desert state of Mauritania, took on an added urgency.For Gulf of Guinea states there is not only terror about what their armies may also soon be facing, but concern, too, that America could be abandoning them to the fight.Even as Britain and France step up their presence in the region, the Trump administration says it is considering substantial cuts to its military presence and ending aid to the France’s Sahelian mission, Operation Barkhane.Whatever happens, Western military trainers at Flintlock say that training and equipping Sahelian armies is vital to winning the battle on the African front of the war on terror. Ultimately, western forces will not be able to leave the region until local armies are strong enough to take the battle to the foe. British officers talk of seeking “to learn the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq”. “The solution is going to be local,” says Brig Gus Fair, commander of the Specialised Infantry Group, a British army unit that trains foreign forces, echoing the mantra repeated by American officers, “African solutions to African problems”.The challenges facing local armies were painfully on display during a training exercise for special forces soldiers from Burkina Faso at Flintlock in Thies last week.Under orders to attack a jihadist camp then capture or kill a pre-identified terrorist commander and recover documents with key intelligence in his office, the soldiers mixed up north and south, captured the wrong man and forgot the intelligence documents.Such mistakes could happen in any training mission in the heat of the moment, even the best British or American soldiers might slip up. But typically such exercises are repeated up to six times. The Burkinabe soldiers got to do it just once, given the time-constraints of the instructors working with so many armies. Amid a growing terror of being overwhelmed, Sahelian states have announced massive army recruitment drives. Given the scale of the slaughter, persuading volunteers is far from easy, however. Instead, some states are increasingly relying on outsourcing the war to ethnic militias – tacitly in Mali’s case, openly in Burkina Faso’s – who have fast established a reputation both for brutality and for carrying out massacres against communities perceived, mostly without basis, as supporting the jihadists.Western officials hope that, should it come to it, Burkina Faso’s neighbours will avoid making similar mistakes. Others worry they may have no choice.The Gulf of Guinea states are supposedly stronger than the Sahel, one of the world’s poorest regions. Ghana and Ivory Coast are West Africa’s second and third richest states, eclipsed only by Nigeria, the continent’s biggest economy. Unlike the Sahel, they are also seen as comparatively strong, functioning states.Yet there are also too many similarities for comfort. The northern regions of both Ghana and Ivory Coast are not just more Muslim but far poorer than the remainder of either country.The jihadists exploited similarly marginalised communities in Sahelian states, using local grievances as a highly effective recruiting tool. There are religious differences to exploit too, both within Islam along the ide between Sunnis and Sufis, and outside it, between Muslims and Christians.A series of massacres in Burkina Faso that has seen gunmen burst into Sunday church services and massacre people at prayer has already sparked anger and terror among Christians in northern Ghana.Some churches have already banned backpacks and placed scanning machines outside their entrances, fearing suicide bombs.If religious and ethnic tensions are mounting in the Gulf of Guinea’s stronger states, the problem is even more acute in Togo and Benin, much poorer, more dysfunctional and more similar to the Sahelian states.Last year two French tourists were kidnapped in the Pendjari national park in northern Benin by Islamic State militants and two French soldiers killed in their eventual rescue.The militants may have been helped, a regional security source said, by locals with land grievances caused by the displacement of locals to create the park, a key refuge for some of the world’s last substantial populations of forest elephant.The jihadists are thought to have slipped into Benin along one of the many smuggler and bandit routes that dot Burkina Faso’s borders with its southern neighbours, he said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security.

three weeks, and the NHS does not have enough beds to cope with them, the chief medical officer has warned.Prof Chris Whitty said there was a “slim to zero” chance of avoiding a global pandemic, which could see “huge pressure” on the NHS, making it impossible for all who need beds to get them. The chief medical officer said Britain had now largely shifted from the containment to the “delay” phase of its strategy. The Government’s realistic worst case scenarios suggest that 80 per cent of people could get coronavirus, with between 15 and 20 per cent of those cases needing hospital care. Prof Whitty said: “One of the things that is clear if you model the epidemic is that we will get 50 per cent of all the cases over a 3 week period and 95 per cent of the cases over a 9 week period, if if follows the trajectory we think it is likely to.”“If all of those were spaced out on the NHS over two or three years that would be easily manageable but it’s the fact they are so heavily concentrated,” he told MPs. “If this goes to the top end of the range ... there will be a period where the NHS has huge pressure on it for a relatively short period of time.”“Depending on how high the peak, this could be anywhere from a rather bad winter for the NHS but in spring or summer for the NHS through to huge numbers way overtopping the ability of the NHS realistically to put everyone in beds and that obviously would have big pressures on the service,” he told the Health and Social Care Committee. As the number of cases in the UK reached 90, as shown in the map above, Prof Whitty said the global situation meant the UK could not contain the virus. “We now have several countries and possibly many countries in the world with significant ongoing transmission.“And I think that\u0027s an important framing to this because if the original plan was very much predicated on the idea of if it can be controlled in China, and contained everywhere else, this virus might go away.“I think the chances of that happening are now very slim, slim to zero.”Elderly people will be urged to avoid crowded areas, or stay at home entirely, when outbreaks become more widespread, the chief medical officer said.While overall mortality rates for coronavirus are estimated at 1 per cent, this rises to 15 per cent for those in their 80s, and around 8 per cent for those in their 70s.Prof Chris Whitty said: “One of the bits of advice that we will give is for people who are older or who have pre-existing health conditions to have some degree of isolation from more public environments. “I think it is more likely we will make some advice for people who are older citizens and people with pre-existing health conditions to avoid crowded areas.”The chief medical officer has been being questioned by MPs about whether the House of Commons will be closed, in the event of a major outbreak.He suggested that it was more likely that inidual MPs and members of the Lords might be advised to stay home if they were elderly, or had existing health complaints. Medical students could be asked to perform roles on hospitals normally done by doctors, in the event of a coronavirus epidemic. Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer said that final-year medical students and those who had just started out as junior doctors may be given extra tasks.He also expanded on plans to ask recently retired doctors and nurses will also be asked to come back into service. Many medics have expressed concern that elderly staff would be at grave risk, given the high mortality rates of the virus in older people.Prof Whitty said older staff could be deployed into non-patient facing roles that may still be clinical.For example, they might be helping with NHS 111 ... there are things that could be done that would not put them at risk but would help them to serve the public for this period of time when the NHS was under considerable strain.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for

fuelling","story":"Vicars are often thought of as worthy dispensers of advice and givers of spiritual comfort to their flock.But it\u0027s not until now they can add fashionista to their job description.Clergy members have surprisingly found themselves sat in fashion\u0027s front row after propelling the latest trend in eco-friendly clothing froward.For the first time in the church\u0027s history the biannual Christian Resources Exhibition (CRE) in Coventry featured an ethical clothing range among its thousands of stands, stalls, events and speakers.The CRE, which began in 1985, showcases everything from puppets to pulpits and computers to communion wine - and is visited by around 2,500 local church leaders and member.But yesterday\u0027s Clergy on the Catwalk event saw 11 vicars and clergy from varying denominations walking a runway wearing clerical clothing made from bamboo.The creator of the collection has now revealed the vicars are piggybacking on the growing trend for eco-friendly clothing and fuelling a rise in the sales of bamboo shirts.Charlotte Sparey-Dell, 34, founder of the Lottie’s Eco brand, began making bamboo clothing two years ago and set up her company after working for global lingerie brands, Playtex and Wonderbra.Ms Sparey-Dell, of Worcester, usually makes underwear, but has been designing vicars’ tops - which cost between £40 and £70 - for two years.She said that she has increased her staff from one to two full-time employees since to cope with demand, and has since launched an entire collection just for clerics after her local vicar asked her to make her something for which was sustainable, comfortable and fashionable.“I met my local vicar at a church fete and she asked me to make her a clergy top,” Ms Sparey said. “I gave her photos of some of my designs and then when on holiday.“But while I was away, I had ten different orders via a Facebook group for ‘clergy mummies’ and they had all been sharing it. I was like, ‘woah, there’s something in this’, and it’s just taken off from there.“Clergy are particularly eco-conscious, and they love the clothing that’s also modern and comfortable.”Major high street brands have also caught onto the trend. Marks and Spencer sell bamboo socks as well as an array of smaller, boutique brands specialising in yoga, sportswear and underwear.However now, members of the clergy appear to be catching on to what is already a growing trend in the UK, with surging demand for eco-friendly, ethical and recyclable clothing.Ms Sparey-Dell added: “We normally make underwear, but really it’s the vicar stuff which has snowballed.Ms Sparey-Dell studied contour fashion at De Montfort University in Leicester and became interested in creating “next level clothing that would look great and also protect the planet” and first discovered the qualities of bamboo in South Africa.Ramona Samuel, a 51-year-old methodist minister based in Chelmsford, Essex, and one of the 11 models who took part in the Clergy on the Catwalk event, said: “I love clothes, but it’s difficult trying to find eco-friendly clothes that fit with your fashion sense.“Eco-friendly clothing is really important because we know about how unfair and unjust the clothing trade can be, so it’s really nice to feel something that you don’t only feel good in - but also feel good about buying. Bamboo is so soft on your skin and so nice to wear.”While Ms Sparey-Dell\u0027s bamboo is Organic certificated by Eco Cert, not everyone is convinced that natural fibres are always the more eco-friendly option. Bamboo may be a fast-growing figure, “but it’s sometimes grown with pesticides and  chemicals are often used when it’s turned into fabric,” Orsola de Castro, founder of campaign group Fashion Revolution, told Vogue last month. “Unless it comes from an organic source, bamboo is incredibly polluting.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ronaldinho questioned paraguay false passport","story":"Former Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho has been ordered to appear in front of prosecutors after allegedly travelling to Paraguay with a false passport on Wednesday. Ronaldinho, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002, and his brother checked into a hotel near the capital Asuncion using allegedly falsified travel documents.Police held Ronaldinho, 39, and his brother, Roberto de Assis, for questioning after discovering the documents at the The Yacht and Golf Club Hotel in the city of San Lorenzo, following a tip-off from immigration authorities. Ronaldinho will be heard at eight in the morning on Thursday at the prosecutor\u0027s office, Interior Minister Euclides Acevedo said. The pair travelled from São Paulo, Brazil, to Paraguay after casino owner Nelson Belotti invited them to attend a series of charity events raising money for the “Angelic Fraternity” foundation. Police are also investigating Wilmondes Sousa Liria, a 45-year-old Brazilian businessman who is alleged to have provided Ronaldinho and Assis with the travel documents. The three remained in their hotel on Wednesday before giving statements at a local police station today.The news comes as a blow to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, whose government appointed Ronaldinho as an ambassador for tourism in September.At the time of his appointment Ronaldinho was prohibited from leaving the country after police confiscated his and Assis’ passports for failing to pay a fine for environmental damage. In September, Ronaldinho and Assis were fined more than $2.3 (£1.78) million for building an illegal pier on the shores of the Guaíba Lake, a conservation area in Brazil. It is unclear whether they paid the fine to retrieve their Brazilian passports. Ronaldinho is set to face a wider investigation into allegations of money laundering, an automatic occurrence in Paraguay when a person is found to be travelling on a false document. Paraguayan authorities said there is no reason to suspect that Ronaldinho is involved in any money laundering activities. In 2013, Assis was found not guilty, upon appeal, of money laundering charges relating to a bank transfer of $884,000 (£684,500). More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"self isolating pet owners told restrict contact animals dog","story":"Pet owners who are self-isolating have been urged to restrict contact with their animals after a dog tested positive for coronavirus in Hong Kong.Daniella Dos Santos, the president of the British Veterinary Association (BVA), said pet owners should wash their hands before and after touching their animals and try to avoid being licked by them.This is an escalation of previous advice, which had only applied to people who had been diagnosed with coronavirus.The updated guidance comes in response to reports from medical experts in Hong Kong that a Pomeranian dog was found to be infected with low levels of the disease, believed to be the first case of human to animal transmission.The dog has been placed in quarantine, while its 60-year-old owner is in hospital with Covid-19. However, scientists called for calm and pointed out that the low levels of the virus detected in the dog meant the chances of it spreading to another animal or a human were low.Ms Dos Santos said: We are particularly keen not to cause any unnecessary concern that could lead to pet abandonment. We would emphasise that, at the moment, there remains no evidence that pet animals can be a source of infection of Covid-19 for humans or other animals, or that they become sick. The main source of infection remains human to human transmission.She added that people who have been told to self-isolate because of infection or risk of infection should restrict contact with pets as a precaution until more is known. Practising good hygiene is absolutely essential, she said. Owners should always wash their hands before and after any interaction with an animal and avoid being licked by their pet. If a pet shows clinical signs, please do not take it to the vet. Call your vet practice for further advice.The dog in Hong Kong was tested for the first time on February 26 before three further tests confirmed it had a low level of infection. A spokesman for Hong Kong\u0027s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said experts from the University of Hong Kong and the World Organisation for Animal Health had agreed that the infection had been passed from human to animal.During the 2003 Sars outbreak in 2003, a small number of dogs and cats tested positive but did not transmit the disease to humans or other animals of the same species.British scientists poured cold water on the likelihood of mass coronavirus infection among pets and animals.Jonathan Ball, a professor of medical virology at the University of Nottingham, questioned how relevant the finding was in terms of the wider spread of the infection, which has been driven by human to human transmission. The levels in the dog are very low and we also don\u0027t know how widespread this type of low level outbreak could be, he said.  I doubt it could spread to another dog or a human because of the low levels. Obviously we need to find out more, but we don\u0027t need to panic. The real driver of the outbreak is humans.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sheikh mohammeds status uae moderniser lies tatters","story":"Shortly after becoming vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum promised to modernise his country and make it one of the best in the world by 2021.Now the ruler of Dubai\u0027s reputation as a moderniser lies in tatters after a British judge found he had abducted and kidnapped his own adult daughters after they dared to stand up to him.The irony that the collapse of his marriage, to an Arabian princess eager to test the boundaries of women\u0027s rights in traditional Muslim countries, has damaged him so irrevocably cannot have escaped him.His fall is even more spectacular considering that Britain – a country he has revered since studying here as a boy – has been the author of his humiliation. The 70-year-old billionaire, with lavish homes in the south of England, came to count the Queen as a personal friend, in part due to their shared passion for horse racing. He is pictured below at Newmarket racecourse in 2013.Born on July 15 1949, he was one of four sons to Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al-Maktoum, the vice president and second prime minister of the UAE.He soon learned hunting and the Arabian sport of falconry. While his father taught him basic horsemanship skills, he was being prepared for high office. In 1966 he was sent to Britain to study at the Bell School of Languages in Cambridge, where he developed a passion for poetry (he regularly posts writing on his Instagram account). He enrolled on a six-month course at the Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot, where he was awarded the sword of honour for high achievement.His first visit to a racecourse came at Newmarket for the 1967 2000 Guineas.Two years later, Sheikh Mohammed returned to Dubai and became Head of Dubai Police and Public Security before his father appointed him as defence minister. He was then the youngest person in the world to hold such office. In 1995, he became Crown Prince of Dubai and supervised major projects to transform it from an oil-rich state into a Middle Eastern business hub and tourist destination for the super-rich.He drove through the construction of the Burj al Arab, a super-luxury hotel, and the towering Burj Khalifa, pictured below, the tallest building in the world. Both buildings overlook the three artificial Palm Islands, which opened in 2001.Two years after making Princess Haya his sixth wife in 2004 (he is rumoured to have up to 30 children), he became the ruler of Dubai and vice president of the UAE.But his true passion remains race horses. He established Godolphin, a global thoroughbred breeding operation, in 1994. It has bases in four continents and he has stables in Newmarket, near one of his homes, Dalham Hall. Publicity for Sheikh Mohammed boasts that, despite his vast wealth, he is a people\u0027s person who has set up numerous charitable foundations. But the reputation he fought to cultivate has suffered such a blow that even a man with so much money may now struggle to rewrite it. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk coronavirus cases map","story":"Coronavirus reached Britain in late January, cases have been on the rise since late February and the first death was recorded on 5 March.Thousands of people in the UK have been tested for Covid-19, and the government released an emergency action plan to deal with the potential pandemic.It warned up to one in five workers in the UK could be off sick during a coronavirus peak, while the police may switch to only dealing with serious crime. The 27-page document sets out the UK-wide response, with possible measures including the cancellation of non-urgent operations and retired NHS staff being called back to duty.The \u0027s map below plots where cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the UK. It is sourced from Public Health England announcements and will be updated regularly based on trustworthy data.On Wednesday, Public Health England confirmed 36 new cases of coronavirus had been detected in the UK - the largest increase in cases seen in the UK to date.On Thursday the Department for Heath and Social Care said an additional 25 patients had been infected in England, bringing the total across the UK to 115.They also released information on the locations of those cases detected on Wednesday.Of those located in England, the largest number has been detected in London, with 25 cases recorded in the capital.Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty said 29 of the new cases this week had travelled from recognised countries or clusters under investigation.He said three contracted the virus in the UK, but it was not yet clear if they contracted it directly or indirectly from someone returning from abroad. 12 new cases were recorded in the UK on Tuesday, including patients in London, Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Bury, Wirral, Greater Manchester, Humberside and Kent.Prof Whitty said all UK cases were being investigated and contact tracing has begun.He told BBC Breakfast there could be a need to do extreme things to protect the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions in the event of a UK epidemic.He said the NHS would cope with a major spread of cases but could come under very high pressure in a large epidemic.He said: For the great majority of people this will be a mild or moderate disease, anything from a sniffle to having to go to bed for a few days rather like with mild flu.And there are some people who will get it with no symptoms at all, but for a minority of people - and this is particular in people who are older people or people with pre-existing health conditions - the risk is higher.The NHS will always cope because the NHS is an emergency service which is very good at adapting to what it finds itself with.But he said if the UK sees a very large epidemic, then it will put very high pressure on the NHS and there could be several weeks which could be very difficult for the health service and wider society.Prof Whitty said he believes there is now onward transmission between people in the UK - which could lead to spiralling numbers - although only two cases of this nature have been identified so far. Mitigation efforts in the UK will be driven by the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011 and fall into four main areas:At the end of December, the Chinese authorities sent out a public alert warning that a pneumonia of unknown cause had been identified in Wuhan, central China.Some 10 days later, on Jan 7, scientists announced that a new coronavirus was the source of the outbreak – quickly adding that it did not appear to be spreading between humans. At that point, fewer than 60 cases had been found. But now the virus, which has since been named Covid-19, has spread to well over 70 countries, infecting more than 93,000 people and killing nearly 3,200. Scientists believe that the virus has mutated into two strains: the older ‘S-type’ appears to be milder and less infectious, while the ‘L-type’ which emerged later, spreads quickly and currently accounts for around 70 per cent of cases. This map, which updates automatically, shows where the disease is now, how many cases there have been and how many people have died: More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/20/17/Ben-Affleck-Jennifer-Garner.jpg","title":"ben affleck jennifer garner way back rehab alcoholism","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Actor ‘fell of the wagon’ just before shooting was scheduled to beginThe director of The Way Back has revealed that Jennifer Garner called him up to persuade him to continue making the film, after her ex-husband and its lead star Ben Affleck was admitted to rehab.During promotional interviews for the film, Affleck has opened up a lot about his struggles with alcoholism and his relapse in 2018.The actor went to rehab shortly before the film, which follows a former basketball all-star struggling with addiction, was due to begin shooting.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“So, what happened was, just as we started prepping the movie, Ben fell off the wagon,” Gavin O’Connor told student publication 34th Street Magazine.“So he ended up going to rehab, and I didn’t know if the movie was over.

She said, ‘Gavin, he’s asking you, please don’t pull the plug on the movie, he really wants to do this.\u0027”O’Connor explained Affleck “had about a week of detoxing” before he met with the actor to discuss the future of the film.“We spent half a day together and figured out a way to do this that will work for him, because most importantly he needed to recover and needed to get his sobriety on track,” he said.“That overtook everything. And then he got out the day before we started shooting. So we had a very raw, vulnerable guy showing up for our first day of shooting.”The Way Back will arrive in UK cinemas on 24 April.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It could not find an explanation for the circular crater that surrounds the hole – or a proper estimate of just how far the underlying cavern might extend.Holes such as this are of particular interest because their interior caves are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life, Nasa wrote on its Astronomy Picture of the Day page, where it shared the image this week.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Since they could include material left their from previous epochs, they may prove a useful way of looking back into Mars\u0027 past.Nasa is only recently starting to dig unto the large unexplored world beneath the Martian surface. Last week, it showed off the first findings from the InSight spacecraft, which revealed that Mars was seismically active and more, in findings that could help reveal how the red planet was formed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A number of third-party services already offer the ability to delete tweets some time after they are posted, but fleets builds that into the app and offers extra ways of keeping messages hidden.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe messages can only be viewed if users navigate to someone\u0027s profile and click on their avatar.

We also ask the UK to respect our own independence,” Mr Barnier said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Of course, we respect the UK’s sovereignty, and just as the UK sets its own conditions for opening up its market, the EU sets its own conditions for opening up its markets for goods and services.\u0026nbspThe real question is not about our reciprocal independence: the real question is what we do with our respective independence.\u0026nbsp“Our common challenge now is as two independent entities to agree together on ground rules that makes it possible for us to cooperate, to trade\u0026nbspand to travel.”Brexit talks kick off without handshake to avoid spreading coronavirusGiving a review of the first week’s talks, the chief negotiator said the UK was refusing to sign a commitment to stay in the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as rejecting\u0026nbspan agreement tying it to “high standards” for labour,\u0026nbspenvironmental, and state aid\u0026nbspregulations.“The United Kingdom informs us that they do not wish to commit formally to applying the European Convention on Human Rights,” Mr Barnier said.\u0026nbspOn the “level playing field” for regulations, Mr Barnier said the UK said it wanted to maintain high standards, but would not legally commit to them.“Whilst we agree on preserving high standards, my question is why not commit to them formally? It’s a question of trust,” he said.Both sides in negotiations are\u0026nbspkeenly aware that talks, which involve between 200 and 300 officials, could be hit by the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will be taking all necessary precautions so that we can continue,” he said.A senior EU official involved in negotiations downplayed the suggestion there could be an effect: “We haven’t discussed the possible measures to take with the British. We’ll see how the situation will evolve.”\u0026nbspMr Barnier\u0026nbspsaid he thought the degree of change that Brexit would bring on 1 January 2021, when the transition period ends, has been “very much underestimated”. He added that the UK could still extend the transition period if it decided to\u0026nbsp– though Boris Johnson has ruled out doing so.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A migrant rests with a child in his arms next to the Tunca river in Edirne, TurkeySpanish policemen and civil guards sporting Guy Fawkes masks protest in front of Spanish policemen standing guard during a demonstration to demand fair wages in MadridSouth Korean soldiers wearing protective gear spray disinfectant as part of preventive measures against the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, at a market in DaeguA woman shouts as law enforcement officials move in to disperse a group of immigrants who had occupied a historic church and a square.

The first known death outside Washington state has been confirmed in California, which has now declared a state of emergency.Aipac is an influential pro-Israel lobbying group that advocates for a close Israeli-American relationship, and appearances at its annual conferences are usually considered a standard part of any presidential campaign.It is a controversial organisation, which some on the left in particular accuse of exerting undue influence in service of a conservative foreign policy agenda and political candidates who would help enact one.What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsMr Pompeo spoke at the conference on 2 March, telling the audience that “anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism” and rejoicing in the signing of a new decree affirming Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights: “What a truly great two days for two great nations”.Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders\u0026nbspdid not attend this year’s conference, while his fellow frontrunner Joe Biden appeared at the conference in the form of a video.In it, Biden warned attendees that the Israeli government’s aggressive annexation and settlement-building plans were “choking” any chance for peace and undermining the US-Israeli relationship.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryMr Sanders was apparently unaware that billionaire Michael Bloomberg had ended his $500m campaign for the nomination and endorsed Mr Biden. He said “Joe” would now be getting Mr Bloomberg’s support, another thing to distinguish it from his.“There has never been a campaign in recent history which has taken on the entire political establishment,” said Mr Sanders. “That is an establishment that is working frantically to try to defeat us.”Among the things he said were trying to defeat him was a super PAC, The Big Tent Project, that had been spending millions of dollars on political advertising aimed at him.\u0026nbsp“Does anyone seriously believe that a president backed by the corporate world is going to bring about the changes in this country that working families and the middle class and lower-income people desperately need,” he added.What Joe Biden’s comeback on Super Tuesday means for TrumpMr Sanders also said he had spoken to Elizabeth Warren, who performed badly on Tuesday. There is widespread speculation she will soon leave the race, but there is much less clarity about which candidate she will endorse, if either.With Mr Biden now appearing to have the momentum ahead of a flurry of additional primary contests later this month, including Florida, an endorsement from Ms Warren might provide him a crucial lifeline.Yet he said it was right to “respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”Mr Adigrati said the thief probably did not know the value of the necklace.“This particular necklace looks a lot more expensive than what it is, so obviously the temptation was there: gold, bright, iconic Medusa head, so that would have been the temptation,” he told ABC News.Police are appealing for more information on the man, who has yet to be identified. He is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old and about 5ft 9in.The thief left just one clue behind – the hook from his fishing line.Senior constable Bede Whitty said he had never seen a crime quite like it before.“It’s fairly blatant and it’s quite bold as well, to have someone attend with a fishing rod in the middle of the night,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If lockdown was imposed for a month, this rises to £. billion.”This morning the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development slashed the  global growth forecast by .% over the outbreak.It

recession.Last week US oil company Chevron sent  staff home after an employee ed from an Italian skiing trip feeling unwell.Yesterday Matt Hancock refused to rule out coronavirus shutting down entire cities like they have done in China.The Health Secretary also admitted a vaccine to treat the deadly bug was months away and the Government would publish doomsday plans this week.The public are being pushed to make sure they clean their hands as thoroughly as possible to stop the spread of the killer coronavirus bug.The Health Secretary yesterday warned people should scrub their mitts for at least  seconds to destroy as many germs as possible.He told Radio  Live: You should do that for  seconds or more, and the way we explain it to children is that you should sing… wash your hands as long as you’re singing either Happy Birthday or God Save The Queen.This morning shadow Health Secretary Jonathon Ashworth said he would support shutting down cities to control the spread of coronavirus.Mr Ashworth said: If the medical advice and the scientic advice is to take measures along those lines, of course we would support them.If the medical advice is to do something like that then of course we should support it.Symptoms of Covid- can include:In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.The best way to prevent catching any form of coronavirus is to practice good hygiene.If you have cold-like symptoms, you can help protect others by staying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with others.You should also cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough and sneeze then throw it away and wash your hands.Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces which you may have touched is also important.If you have ed from Wuhan in the last  days:If you are in Northern Ireland, call your GP.Please follow

eastenders","story":"It feels like it’s been going at least  years, partly because it survives on just half a dozen endlessly repeated stories, but also due to the fact its shrill tone, right-on agenda and obsession with long-suffering, alcoholic women and spineless men has been copied by almost every other mainstream drama on TV.Take, for instance, last night, where you had the choice of ITV’s Liar or BBC’s The Split.Such a miserable offering, I flipped a coin, lost and ended up watching The Split.If you haven’t suffered like I have, I should explain this is basically just a middle-class version of EastEnders set in a family law firm run by matriarch Ruth and her daughters, who are straight from central soap casting.There’s Nina, the hot one, an alcoholic shoplter who can’t get a bloke.And there’s Hannah, who’s as plain as an envelope and has men fighting over her in the street.There is another one as well, Rose, who can’t get pregnant.But writer Abi Morgan hasn’t the ­faintest idea what to do with her, so the drama tends to revolve around the ­miserable-as-sin Hannah, played by Nicola Walker, who’s been having the least steamy affair in television history with a walking Grolsch advert called Christie Carmichael.They bonded over a mutual love of swimming and legal jargon and now refer to their encounters as “Grayling,” like it was a Prohibited Steps Order.He’s a bit of a git, obviously. As is pretty much everyone  on The Split.The only other ones you really need bother about, though, are the firm’s dandyish boss Zander, whose spirit animal is Rupert The Bear.His partner, Tyler, who “specialises in mergers”, which I think is meant to sound sexy.And Hannah’s unfaithful husband Nathan, played by Stephen Mangan, who’s thinking of getting it on with an office junior called Chloe who is not just the authentic voice of The Split but the entire BBC.“I heard you speak at the Women In Law lunch,” she says, less than enticingly, at one point.“Feminist perspectives on cross-examination. It was great.”Yeah, it sounds like a total riot.You feel for the actors, obviously. They’re constrained not just by the script and the EastEnders rules of drama, but by the subject matter as well.In Walford, they at least have a small choice of storylines.Here, there’s just one. Divorce, orce and more orce.A slightly more savvy drama department would’ve given up on it after one series.The Beeb just ploughs on, though, trying to jolly it along with some insanely annoying incidental music and a couple of guest stars.This series, they’ve gone for broke and landed Donna Air off Byker Grove, who spends the duration of her screen time, as TV presenter Fi Hansen, looking like she’s got a particularly bad smell under her nose.She thinks its disdain for her controlling screen husband, Richie.We all know it looks more like contempt for the show, the plot and the script, which forces poor Nicola Walker to scream: “You have s**t, Nina.We all have s**t.” And there’s another two weeks of this s**t to go.Avoid avoid avoid.MEANWHILE, on Liar, Laura Nielson: “I don’t know how Andrew Earlham died and I don’t care.”Snap.SHE’S McDonald, he’s Dodds. So together they are . . .A right pain in the ar*e.Tala Gouveia is ambitious, no-nonsense DCI Lauren McDonald, who’s come down to Bath, from London, saying things like: “I’m here for two years, tops. Don’t get attached to me.”I won’t.DS Dodds is her dorkish, time-serving partner, played by Jason Watkins, with a non-specic Yokel accent.It could be Bath, it could be Ba’ath Party. The damn thing comes and goes, like the ad breaks, so it’s really hard to tell.Bog-standard Sunday night brain rot, so far.The real trouble here, though, is that as well as a lousy script and bonkers plot, McDonald  Dodds writer Robert Murphy has got a very PC political axe, which he grinds against multi-millionaire entrepreneur Max Crockett , who bears no physical resemblance to the Prime Minister.However, he has got a surprisingly large number of children, a much younger pregnant we and a way of quivering with rage about “the politics of envy” that leaves you in no doubt where all of Murphy’s prejudices lie.The normal rules of quality drama and all the most self-important catch-up viewers dictate that spoilers are absolutely forbidden on a whodunnit.So I’ve got no hesitation telling you it was Kasha, the lesbian, traveller waitress, who shot Max’s secret son, Seth.Begone, McDonald  Dodds.

I think at one time when they started showing the photos I remember gasping, I wanted to get up. My husband was luckily with me and just told me to relax and look down. It was really devastating.Emily - whose father was brother to Pearls grandfather - didnt grow up with Gabriel and his immediate family, but spent a lot of time with him when he was a young child, and still in the care of his loving grandparents Sandra and Robert.She met Pearl a handful of times during that period, and says she had always seemed pleasant enough when they chatted.However, theres one moment when Emily says she caught Pearls eye during the trial - and it will stay with her forever.During one of the impact statement readings, I did make eye contact with her and she did with me. It’s just darkness in her, she recalls.“Whatever le she might have started off with was just ripped out of her soul. There was nothing behind those eyes. No remorse, nothing.“There was no reaction. When we [the family] did the impact statement, not even Isauro had a reaction. He just kept looking down... I have no words for them.”The documentary also references claims that Pearl previously made, alleging she was the victim of gang rape when she was younger.But while Emily says she cant comment on that specically, she adds: “What type of neglect and hate did you receive and was instilled on you to cause physical harm against your own child that you carried for nine months and birthed Gabriel was brought up by his uncle Michael Lemos Carranza and his partner, David Martinez, before moving in with his grandparents in .Its around that time that Emily grew closer to the family, and she recalls him being a playful and loving child - far from the bruised and terried boy he became while living with Pearl in his final eight months of le.“I remember Gabriel was a very quiet boy, he liked to play and jump around with his siblings and cousins. There were always kids around, she says.“His uncle Michael always involved him in planning his birthday parties, that was their thing together.He was a good kid.“He was very happy then. He was in the care of his grandparents, they gave him a lot of love and affection.I witnessed him hugging both of them, and them hugging him back, there was love there.He did know love and affection. It was just the last eight months of his le with Pearl and Isauro that he did not feel that anymore.”Sadly, due to her slowly losing contact with Gabriels grandparents in later years, Emily had no idea Pearl had taken the young boy into her home.In fact, the first she heard of Gabriel being rushed to hospital was when she saw his name on the news.“I saw the cops actually putting Pearl into the cop car. Her name flashed across the screen and I got on the phone straight away, she says.“We were clueless, we had no idea he was going through any of this.“When I saw Gabriel’s name… we were just in complete shock. My mum was able to speak to his grandmother Sandra and she told us he was on le support at a children’s hospital.But two days later they made the decision to disconnect him because he wasn’t going to come back.”One of the most shocking parts of the Netflix documentary is seeing evidence of just how many times Gabriel pleaded for help.Not only did he ask his teacherits normal to bleed after being hit by a belt, he also turned up to school with obvious facial injuries, showed a guard his bruised arm and left his family members so concerned that they called social services themselves.But despite his teachers repeated calls, the guards report and those of his family members, social services did not deem the risk high enough to remove him from his mothers care.“No matter how many times he cried out for help everybody was blinded, nobody was able to see through and help him, Emily says. “The way he died, it’s just unspeakable.”She adds: “He wanted to live. He wanted to be saved and nobody was helping him or listening to him.”Emily is now calling for a major overhaul of Americas social services system.While the documentary details how social workers visited the family multiple times, no action was taken to rescue him.Everybody dropped the ball, everybody overlooked him, Emily says.In what has been described by US media as an unprecedented move, the four social workers involved in the case were eventually charged with criminal negligence.The charges were later dropped because prosecutors did not prove the social workers “had the requisite duty to control the abusers,” and concluded they “did not have care or custody of Gabriel.All four of them have now reportedly been fired by the LA County Department of Children and Family Services .Why is the DCFS in placeyou’re not there to protect the children, but to help the parents and get them resources  Emily says.Yet you’re going to leave a child who’s crying out for help to live in a home where he’s constantly being abused.”“They’ll make excuses so they don’t feel the blame, but like I tell everybody, at night I know I can sleep peacefully, but they can’t. Gabriel’s face will haunt them for the rest of their lives.Social worker Stefanie Rodriguez and other representatives of child protection agencies visited Gabriels home on a number of occasions.They claimed to have never found strong enough signs of abuse in order to remove Gabriel from the house.Later investigations revealed Rodriguez had never received information detailing previous allegations that Pearl Rodriguez had neglected her other children.Emily, with the help of some friends, has now set up a Facebook page, Gabriels Justice, dedicated to raising awareness of the case and pushing for changes to the wider social services system in the US.Its gained more than , followers, but while its proved a major success, Emily says, ultimately, nothing will ever bring her cousin back.“All I know is he’s in a better place, nobody can ever hurt him again. That gives me comfort, knowing he can never be hurt again, she says.“But I only wish that the circumstances were dferent and that he was saved. I wish he was still with family rather than being taken from us.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In extreme poverty, there is just not the ability to wash and sanitise hands regularly, for example.But this is the UK – one of the richest countries in the western world. We have the ability to collectively try and shut this disease down from spreading here.I’ve been fascinated and horried in equal measure over the past week on my talkRADIO show as listeners have shared true gross out stories of folk not washing their hands after going to the public loos or coughing all over communal food in the workplace or sneezing without a tissue on public transport.We can do better. And now we must – our very way of le could be dependent on it.In Japan where the tradition of wearing masks began, it was because people who had colds wanted to try and protect others from their germs.And perhaps Kim Woodburn – the undisputed queen of clean – had a point last week when she told me we are acting like “dirty devils” in this country and in this case it could actually kill us.The time has come for a dialogue about how we can call out people publicly but politelythey fail to reach basic standards of cleanliness.Looking after ourselves and being kind to each other is not simply limited to the words we use in the public domain.If you are running a business how about encouraging staff who are sick and clearly putting others at risk of infection to have the opportunity to work for a couple of days from home without feeling they are letting the side down in some way.If you are not in a good way healthwise yourself then take a couple of days off, avoid public transport and enclosed spaces with others, and realise that the world won’t come to an end while you’re recovering.If you are a parent or teacher start enforcing standards on our kids when it comes to going to the toilet and washing hands and eating.Andyou run a restaurant make sure hand sanitisers and soap are always available for customers and staff.And Nandos, I’m going to call you out here. As a very wealthy company you can afford to pay staff to make sure your restaurants are clean rather than expecting staff to do it as a favour after their shts, as a recent BBC investigation found.Your company can also most certainly afford to buy dferent mops and cleaning equipment to be used in the toilets and the kitchen, which staff have said is currently not provided.These very basic standards will help us all as a society and not just in the very urgent fight against a coronavirus pandemic.It’s about having a basic respect for each other.

And he had to be taken to hospital for horrible, complex, surgery.Didn’t realise  Gordon Bennett, talk about the elephant in the room. I mean, literally. The kid was half the size of their house. She didn’t notice the lack of exercise and the food Harry was putting away  And the fact that he took up the entire sofa and then some Whose fault is it that Harry needed an op We have an obesity epidemic. It is almost certainly this which has caused a drop in le expectancy in our poorest areas. The first such drop for a century.But now the obesity lobby and the health professionals have decided that obesity shouldn’t be “stigmatised”. Asit were an illness just like any other.Something which happens, without the victim knowing it is happening. This is b******s, and it’s dangerous.And stigma is a useful tool in the fight against obesity.It was only when my own son, during an argument a few years back, told me I was a fat, lardy t***er that I decided to sort my weight out. I’ve put most of it back on now so I need another bout of name-calling to provoke me to more action.My point is that fat-shaming can be very useful.Because being fat isn’t good for us and nor is it good for society. It costs the NHS millions each year. It makes people’s lives a misery. It is right that it should carry a stigma. Remove the stigma and you make being fat the natural state of being, no blame attached.Oh, you’re fat. How did that happen  What terrible bad luck, but never mind. But that is very far from the truth. With the exception of that tiny minority of people who are fat as a consequence of their genes, obesity is eminently and quite easily avoidable.Its main cause, these days, is a lack of exercise. If you’re a mum or dad and your kid is looking a bit porky, get them out for a walk every day, or do some sport with them. And keep an eye on what they are eating.Maybe ration the amount of time they spend online, tapping and swiping away on their fat a***s, pausing only to swallow a bowl of Doritos.This is surely basic parenting. Looking after your kids. Becauseyou don’t do that, they will die very young indeed.And it isn’t the Government that’s to blame. Or blind chance, or bad luck. It is because of lestyle choices. That’s the important word — choices.If you take exercise and keep an eye on what you eat, you won’t get fat and your hip won’t suddenly give up the ghost and collapse.The more we insist, out of kindness, that being fat is no fault of the inidual, the bigger the problem will grow.And now,you’ll excuse me, I have to take the dog for a walk. Four miles.That will lose me about  calories, tops. So still some way to go.INCIDENTALLY, on the subject of these face masks. Me and the family are going away for a few days in April. This will require going to an AIRPORT.Awful places, airports. Full of whacko foreigners who’ve just eaten a stewed bat and wonder why they are feeling a bit under the weather.So I had the following discussion with the missus about whether we should invest in face masks . . .Her: “Trouble is, they don’t work.”Me: “The really expensive ones do, the ones with filters. So they say.”Her: “Oh, right. But we’d look like twats, wouldn’t we ”Me: “Yes, we’d look like twats. No face masks.”That’s the British way. Rather die of pneumonia than look a bit of a twat.We’ve been told that in a worst-case scenario, , British people will die. Almost all of these, according to the experts, are elderly people with serious underlying medical conditions.Just to get this risk thing into perspective – how many of those people would have died anyway, as a consequence of those medical conditions, over the next six months THE “You Can’t Say That!” brigade are at it again.This time they have banned a woman called Selina Todd, pictured, from speaking at the Oxford University International Women’s Festival.Ironically, it was a festive which SHE helped to organise.Todd is an academic and a feminist. She has been barred from speaking because transgender activists don’t like her.They accuse her of being “transphobic”, which she denies. She probably just thinks – like a lot of the population and scientic community – that men who transition to being women are still basically men.We have to fight back against this hysterical tyranny imposed on us all by a tiny, minuscule, rump of deranged activists.It is time institutions such as Oxford University stood up for the principles of freedom of speech.That they fail to do so is a national disgrace.DANNY Baker’s been talking about how the BBC “threw him under a bus.”Baker was sacked for having tweeted a joke about Harry and Meghan and their son, Archie. He was accused of racism. But I doubt there’s a less racist bloke in the country.The BBC should admit it made a big mistake.Not only was it unjust, but I really miss listening to Danny on the radio – he’s a brilliant broadcaster.So here’s a suggestion. Give him Rylan Clark-Neal’s slot on Radio . I can’t be the only person in the country who turns off as soon as I hear him speak.Baker would bring a bit of wit to a network currently lacking it.So whether I like it or not she is now part of my world.

In fact our carbon footprint is its smallest since .Far from “doing nothing”, as Greta Thunberg claims, our emissions are down  per cent in a decade.Two per cent of our power comes from coal. In Germany it’s  — and China and India are building scores of new coal-burning plants.Heathrow’s expansion has been halted while they build HUNDREDS of new airports.And while we introduce bans and taxes that make Britain cleaner but threaten our prosperity, the world’s mega-polluters carry on regardless.Green campaigners should target those with the worst record, not one of the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The report comes as cases of coronavirus in the UK saw the biggest day-on-day increase in coronavirus cases, with  people now confirmed to have the virus. The jump comes as Englandaposs chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned that a UK epidemic is looking likely. At this point in time we think it is likely, not definite, that we will move into onward transmission and an epidemic here in the UK, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme on Wednesday.  Commenting on the report, Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier, said: As the coronavirus spreads, the importance of the NHS and nurses who look after us becomes ever more apparent. There are , nursing vacancies. Plans to increase the numbers of nurses starting degrees have failed to meet expectations. It takes three to four years for policies to train new nurses to have an impact. She added that the NHS People Plan, expected in the spring, must be fully funded and finally start to tackle the real reasons why there are not enough nurses. Responding to the report, the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, said next weekaposs Budget is an opportunity for the government to address the issue. Susan Masters, the Royal College of Nursingaposs director of nursing, policy and practice, added: There simply arenapost enough nurses joining the profession in England to look after the health of the population. Next weekaposs Budget is the perfect opportunity for the Government to respond to the workforce problems of NHS and social care. We are calling for investment to remove financial barriers for nursing students, by paying for tuition fees and providing grants for the real costs of living. Until thereaposs a law clarying who is responsible and accountable for workforce in Government and throughout the health and care system, patient safety remains at risk.

It is the second time a little-known change to peopleaposs surplus earnings has been delayed, as ministers try to figure out how to make it work. At the moment, the Department for Work and Pensionsmostly turns a blind eye to claimants who earning wildly fluctuating amounts from one month to the next. From April , new rules were due to restrict the amount of Universal Credit these people could claim. But those new rules were postponed to April  after the governmentaposs social security watchdog raised serious doubts they would work.Today, DWP ministers announced the rules have been postponed for another year to April  - saving claimants from £million in cuts. Around , fewer people will see their Universal Credit award reduced, minister Will Quince said. This will safeguard the efficient administration of Universal Credit. What is this about  The obscure rule change was due to hit a large group of people on Universal Credit , the six-benefits-in-one payment that is being rolled out across the country.Lots of people who claim Universal Credit have a job, but their salary is low enough to be on benefits.However,youaposre self-employed, part time, zero-hour or a aposgig economyapos worker, your earnings change from one month to the next.So in a good month, you might earn too much to claim Universal Credit.

This creates a massive headache for Jobcentre chiefs, who have to work out how to treat you and how much in benefits you should get. Whataposs the rule change  In a bid to make things fairer, the government wants to change how it deals with surplus earnings - the excess money in months where you earn too much to get UC. The surplus earnings rule means when you reapply for UC, you have any surplus earnings youaposve racked up in the previous  months taken into account.So - say you have a bumper month in May and earn £, over the threshold to claim UC. But then in June, youaposre £ under it. You still wonapost get UC.Thataposs because when you put the two months together, youaposre still over the threshold by £,.

From now on, people on the six-in-one benefit will be given a guaranteed one-off payment - averaging £ a head - when they hit state pension age and have to leave UC. The £m policy is expected to guarantee cash for , Universal Credit claimants who hit state pension age in the next five years.It is a victory for a campaign backed by  MPs from Labour , Lib Dem, SNP , Plaid Cymru, the Greens and DUP after a gap in the law was spotted by a local Citizens Advice office in Flintshire. The Citizens Advice staff said pensioners were risking being left without money for a long period, due to the way Universal Credit and the New State Pension are each paid.Some claimants saw their UC payment end weeks before they hit state pension age,they didnapost file a claim for Pension Credit. Yet they then also had to wait up to five weeks for their pension to be paid, according to researchers for Alyn and Deeside MP Mark Tami who raised the problem. Today Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey insisted the DWP had already been filling the gap using discretionary powers. But she confirmed a new law will guarantee that all pensioners receive the right amount no matter what. She explained that pensioners will now receive payment for the entire Universal Credit assessment period in which they hit the pension age. Previously, the law said they only had to be paid only up to the date they hit the pension age, or the end of the previous month-long assessment period, Mr Tamiaposs office said.  Mr Tami told the Mirror: Iaposm obviously delighted that the government has listened and I obviously welcome the changes to what was a very unfair system. The government couldnapost really defend the existing position. Mr Tami praised the Department for Work and Pensionsfor acting swtly to solve the problem just weeks after he raised it in an Early Day Motion - a device that usually has little impact. Despite the DWP insisting it had already been covering the gap, he added: There does remain an issue with people who have suffered a loss already as a result of the provision.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailLabour has accused the government of sitting on its hands after Europeaposs largest regional airline, Flybe, collapsed into administration, threatening thousands of jobs and the future viability of a number of airports across the UK. Flybeaposs demise, announced early on Thursday and blamed in part on a drop in demand caused by the coronavirus outbreak, sparked fierce condemnation from unions and opposition politicians, who criticised both the airlineaposs owners and the Government for failing to act to save it. Shadow transport minister Karl Turner said: The collapse of Flybe is disastrous news for passengers and employees alike, and will cause real anxiety in many regions throughout this country. The loss of , jobs, many in areas very heavily reliant on aviation, will be an extremely heavy blow, as will the wider impact on supply chains and regional economies. He added: Yet again airline workers face an anxious and uncertain future whilst the Government has sat on its hands and allowed this to happen. Recent airline failures have already lost approximately , jobs. The Government must respond this time and provide Flybe staff with all the necessary support.Mr Turner also asked what the government was doing to mitigate the risk of the coronavirus to other airlines and how the regional links will be maintained regional links following the firmsapos collapse.  The Government defended its decision not to save Flybe from collapse, but said it stands ready to support the failed airlinesapos passengers and staff. Transport Minister Kelly Tolhurst said the Government had been working tirelessly to help the business stay flying, but the spread of Covid- has hampered these efforts. In a statement, she told MPs: Unfortunately, in a competitive market, companies do fail and it is not the role of Government to prop them up. She added: We have been working tirelessly to explore multiple options with Flybeaposs shareholders to find a solution. Flybe outlined that problems with their business had been compounded by the outbreak of coronavirus which in the last few days had resulted in a signicant impact on demand. The directors, therefore, decided it was not viable to keep Flybe operating. Ms Tolhurst said there is sufficient capacity with other airlines to help passengers stranded abroadhome.  She told MPs: I must be really clear, we are in this situation today because Flybe shareholders, directors, took the decision to place the business into insolvency. This is not where I, the aviation minister, wanted to be with Flybe and I am acutely aware of the impact that this will have on the regional airports throughout the country. Pushed by the Transport Committee chair and Tory MP Huw Merriman on when the airline insolvency reform mentioned in the Queenaposs Speech will be brought forward, Ms Tolhurst said she is keen to get that legislation moved forward as soon as possible. Warning of the impact on regional connectivity, the SNPaposs transport spokesman Gavin Newlands said: Thereaposs no doubt that Flybe management have questions to answer, the warning signs have been clear for many, many years.  However, though I do not blame the UKaposs Government for Flybeaposs demise, it too has some serious questions to answer - the Secretary of State stood at that despatch box and spoke of the rescuing of Flybe and yet here we are. Ms Tolhurst replied that the department is absolutely determined to make sure that we are able to continue as much as possible regional routes. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said the Government is urgently working with airlines to encourage them to fill routes previously operated by Flybe.

The submission contains allegations against  MPs, one MEP, nine election candidates and  party members, among others, according to the MCB. MCB secretary general Harun Khan said the Tories have a systemic and widespread Islamophobia crisis and accused the party of denial, dismissal and deceit. He criticised the EHRC for having failed to give any response to its first formal call for the watchdog to investigate in May and urged it to now take swt action. The Tories have committed to an inquiry into all forms of discrimination within the party but have resisted calls to set up an independent inquiry into Islamophobia specically. The MCB, which represents mosques, schools and charitable associations, handed its first document to the EHRC in May detailing about  iniduals it believes have displayed Islamophobia or made anti-Islam or anti-Muslim comments. But in renewing its calls for the EHRC to investigate it has submitted a document which has swelled to include double the number of claims. Mr Khan said it was extraordinary that the watchdog has not announced whether it will take action in the  months since the first document was submitted. There is no doubt that the Conservative Party has an Islamophobia crisis: it is institutional, systemic and widespread. The partyaposs response has been one of denial, dismissal and deceit, he said. This results in clear discrimination against Muslims because of their religion.  The absence of meaningful action by the Conservative Party despite the wealth of evidence makes it all the more important that the EHRC recognises the impact of this level of Islamophobia in our governing party, and takes swt action. An EHRC spokeswoman said the watchdog was still waiting for the Tories to reveal the terms of its inquiry while considering a decision. We are actively considering what,any, action we may take in relation to the handling of Islamophobia and other discrimination within the Conservative Party, she said. We are also awaiting the final terms of reference of the partyaposs independent review which we will consider as part of our decision making process.  Allegations added to the dossier include: - The PMaposs chief adviser Dominic Cummings orchestrating the Vote Leave campaign playing on fears of immigration and hate against Muslims, including when claiming Muslim-majority country Turkey was joining the EU. - Tory MP Daniel Kawczynski being reprimanded but not suspended over speaking at a conference alongside far-right leaders. - New MP Dehenna Davison being pictured with two far-right activists, one of whom was allegedly pictured burning a Koran next to a message with a racial slur reading f*** P****. She has said the pictures were taken at a public event and that she in no way whatsoever condones their views.  - Karl McCartney, who is also from the new intake of Tory MPs, retweeting posts by the anti-Islam activist known as Tommy Robinson.- Sally-Ann Hart, another newcomer, describing as an affecting read an anti-Islam activistaposs article claiming the womenaposs march against Donald Trump had been hijacked to promote the Muslim agenda.- Andrew Sabisky, who was forced to stand down as an adviser over numerous comments, using a discredited statistic forecasting the UK to be a majority Islamic nation by .

But in a result that stunned pundits, the former Vice President emerged as the frontrunner in what is now a two-horse race with Bernie Sanders. Sanders also won big, taking his home state of Vermont as well as Utah, Colorado and Calornia. But Biden won southern and midwest states while scoring a dramatic upset in Texas. He even took rival Elizabeth Warren’s home state of Massachusetts – where he did not appear in person and where Sanders had campaigned aggressively. The results ended the presidential hopes of billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who dropped out yesterday.It is a remarkable turnaround for Biden, , who said: “We were told, well, when you got to Super Tuesday, it’d be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy. Make no mistake, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.” Mr Sanders, , echoed him, saying: “We are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country.” So who are the two veteran politicians hoping to knock Trump out of the saddle and which campaign would you take a punt on  JOE BIDEN  Viewed as a hero by working-class voters, Biden served as Vice President throughout Barack Obama’s administration. As a key architect of the Affordable Care Act, healthcare remains his top priority – and for good reason, following a series of family tragedies. He lost his first we, Neilia Hunter, and baby daughter Naomi in a car accident in . And in , his lawyer son Beau died of brain cancer. Healthcare, he says, is “personal” to him. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, was born in  in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and moved as a child to Delaware. He still commutes from there to Washington. As a politician, he has maintained close ties to both states, though Trump has accused him of having “deserted” Pennsylvania. “I was in third grade,” Biden hit back. Biden maintains strong ties to Pennsylvania, a critical election battleground that Trump won in . He has based his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia. Although not endorsed by Obama, he talks of their friendship frequently, as well as the work they did together on issues ranging from healthcare to foreign policy. And many Democrat voters, especially African-Americans, cite his relationship with Obama in explaining their support for him.  Over the years, Biden has changed his stance on many issues, bringing himself more in line with the Democratic Party of today. But some voters may find it hard to forget the senator he once was. He voted for the Iraq War as chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In the “tough on crime” era of the s, he voted for mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and increased funding for federal prisons – both policies contributing to mass incarceration. However, his fight for healthcare to be “a right for all”,  years of tackling climate change and openness to immigration all led to huge support. In addition, he has called for a rise in the minimum wage to £., released a criminal justice plan focused on prevention and supports same-sex marriage. He is also known as one of the most empathetic US politicians. But Biden is not without controversy, having been accused of inappropriately touching women – which he denies. If elected, he would be the oldest President to date at his inauguration, aged . BERNIE SANDERS  With an anti-establishment style that has changed little over five decades, Senator Bernie Sanders has attracted a loyal following. Born in New York and the son of a salesman and a housewe, he wed his second we, political consultant Jane O’Meara, in , honeymooning in Russia. A year later, they flew to Cuba hoping to meet Fidel Castro but had to settle for the mayor of Havana. Sanders has a son, Levi, from a previous relationship and three stepchildren. For most of his s and s, he lived “just one step above hand to mouth”, barely paying his bills as a jobbing carpenter and freelance writer. Sanders became interested in politics in  at a meeting in Vermont of the small, anti-war Liberty Union Party, raising his hand to run for the Senate. His bid was unsuccessful. He became an elected official in , as mayor of Burlington in Vermont. Ten years later, he was elected to the House of Representatives as Vermont’s sole congressman. In , he moved to the Senate.

When he went to the doctors and brought up the possibility of cancer the medical experts dismissed the idea.It felt like I was getting food stuck behind my chest, so when I went to the  doctors  they have me dferent medication for that, he told Nottinghamshire Live. I Googled the symptoms and came across cancer and I brought it up in doctors appointments, but they shrugged it off at first because of my age. Once or twice per week I thought food was getting stuck, then it progressed to once per day. Within a few months Aeron had lost kg and was regularly sick. When he went back to the doctors test revealed that he had a cm growth on his food pipe. The cancer had spread to his lymph nodes and liver. During his diagnosis appointment, doctors told him he should realistically think about having months, not years, to live. I do not feel like Iaposm about to die, Mr Williams added.  Iaposve been up and down for the last few weeks. I know itaposs not curable. I was on a soft food diet but now Iaposm on a liquid diet, I have special drinks that are low amounts but high calories. I joined a football leagueas I was about  stone and now Iaposm about , and none of that is through healthy eating or exercise. I would really like to try and push the message of le insurance, because unfortunately being  I did not have this. The cancer crept up in a matter of months and Iaposm leaving my family with nothing. Kirsty was due to go back to university in September, but that has now been put on hold. Itaposs just so sad, she said. We were not expecting this. I was waiting for [the doctor] to tell me she was joking, that he had stomach ulcers, but thataposs not what she said. Itaposs been so dficult. Aeron is now due to have a stent inserted in his throat so he can eat. He will also have more chemotherapy to shrink the tumour, which could leave to further le-prolonging treatmentsuccesful. The family has now set up a JustGiving page to raise £, to pay for the funeral and help support his family in the future.I want to leave something behind because I do not want the kids struggling, Mr Williams added. It would make me feel better and more comfortable when I do go. Iaposm also planning on writing letters and recording messages for my children. I want them to remember who I am.

The officers seized  horses, dogs, alpacas, goats, donkeys and chickens from the farm. Pictures displayed in court today showed the skeleton of an animal underneath a truck at the property - and a trailer coated on the inside with animal faeces. RSPCA officers said the raid came after Geoffrey Bennett and Christine Kelly were suspected of running a puppy farm by the animal welfare charity. The -year-old man and the -year-old woman are on trial before a District Judge at Guildford Magistratesapos Court, accused of  offences under the Animal Welfare Act, .  Charges put to Bennett and Kelly included causing unnecessary suffering to a goat, a miniature poodle and a white collie dog. Specic accusations related to failing to provide dental treatment for five equines, which had led to mouth trauma and failing to treat ulcers on another equine. A warrant was jointly executed by the police and the RSPCA at their home, Hurst Farm on Portsmouth Road, Ripley, Surrey, on January  last year.  The court heard today that  people entered the farm to carry out the warrant. A total of  horses, dogs alpacas, goats, donkeys and chickens were seized from the farm by police, the RSPCA, Trading Standards officers and multiple animal charities. Inspector Tina Ward, taking pictures for the RSPCA, showed the distressing photos of the animal remains to the court. RSPCA Inspector William Rippon, a specialist in puppy farm investigations, told the judge how the animal welfare investigators had split up into two dog teams, three equine barn teams and two equine field teams.  The RSPCA had instructed vets to treat the animals while they were on the farm, the court heard, while gathering evidence of the alleged offences. Sara-Lise Howe, defending Bennett, told the District Judge that the warrant which had been executed at Hurst Farm was a breach of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. Ms Howe said Bennettaposs passport and phone were seized during the raid, alleging that the passport had been kept by the RSPCA for several months, following the publication of an article in The Spectator about it being taken.  It was alleged by Ms Howe that a large amount of cash had been taken from Bennettaposs property during the raid and the RSPCA had not kept a record of who had been entering the premises while they were there. RSPCA Inspector Rippon said: I have not been aware of any allegation regarding that amount of money andit had been made formally to the police I would have been the first point of call. The lawyer argued the RSPCA had taken a leading role in the raid on the farm and asked for disclosure of documents showed the RSPCA had provided suggested wording of the warrant to the police.

According to the NHS, the symptoms of coronavirus- which has claimed the lives of more than , people worldwide, are a cough, high temperature and shortness of breath.But these symptoms are similar to the common cold - so how do you tellyouaposve got a common cold or the virus  Professor Sian Grfiths, from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the BBC that the only way to tell for certain is to take the test. However, there are some things you can look out for which may give you an idea that your cough might be something to worry about. Asked how to tell the dference, she said: Through the test, unless your symptoms go on to develop into chest disease and then youaposre more likely to have coronavirus. The symptoms tend to be fever, shortness of breath and a cough and a cold will probably have a runnier nose than that. But itaposs not foolproof and thataposs why the test is being done. There is a whole lot of testing being done through GPs and hospitals at the moment by Public Health England to seeweaposre missing any cases.  One of the other issues being discussed atis whether itaposs safe to shake hands. No official warning has been issued in the UK, but France has advised its residents to avoid doing it and Switzerland has told people to drop their everyday greeting of kissing on the cheek.London mayor Sadiq Khan has said he will not be shaking hands going forward, and the Queen wore gloves as she handed out MBEs, OBEs and knighthoods for the first time in more than  years. However Johnson insisted the coronavirus threat would not stop him greeting people with a handshake . But many medical experts are saying it might be time to start thinking about cutting the handshake. GP Dr Rosemary Leonard told the BBC: When we all walked into the BBC this morning, the charming people at the desk were all shaking our hands. “I know it’s very British and very polite, we probably ought to stop shaking hands.” The broadcasteraposs health correspondent Fergus Walsh agrees, and also warned that gloves wonapost solve the problem. He said: Gloves might help unless you then then suddenly touch your face, and youaposll be passing on maybe a whole load of germs that way.  We maybe ought to start thinking about not shaking hands any more. The French have advised that French citizens donapost kiss on the cheek so maybe we should be careful about who we kiss.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAn unruly mum who bit and scratched an airline pilot in a row over her child’s buggy is facing jail after being found guilty of assault today. Henrietta Mitaiare, , attacked Swiss Air Captain Guido Keel during a wholly disproportionate reaction when the flight from Zurich landed at Heathrow on Thursday, May  last year. Mitaiare had previously rowed with airport staff and the aircraft’s cabin manager before take-off because she was told she could not take her three-year-old’s buggy with her and had to put it in the hold, a two day trial at Uxbridge Magistrates Court was told. Mitiaireaposs mother Mary Roberts, , who allegedly kicked Captain Keel while he was on the floor was found not guilty of assault. A judge described the attack as so severe that it “passed the custody threshold by a million miles” and Mitaiare, of Kensington, west London, would have to go to prison. Ms Roberts, of Fulham, south west London, was asked to leave the dock as she initially sat still following her acquittal before stranding up to address the press in the public gallery. She ranted: Adolf Hitler is still ruling England and Mussolini is still ruling England and the innocent” before being dragged out of the courtroom by a police officer. The court heard that Mitaiare finally accepted that the collapsable stroller would have to go in the hold and the pair went to their seats before the flight took off for Heathrow. But when it landed, Mitaiare approached the flight manager, Ali Chkerdaa, to get the names of two women at the departure gate she had argued with so she could make a formal complaint to the airline. As they worked for dferent company, he offered to give them his business card instead.  When Mitaiare refused to accept it Captain Keel left the cockpit to offer his own business card which was also turned down. He then put his hand on Mitaiare’s arm to gesture her off the aircraft and asked her to leave. But she became enraged and pulled out her phone to start filming while asking him: “Why did you lay your hands on me  Where is the power ” He responded with “I have the power” but then fell back into the cockpit as he and Mitarare tussled on the floor. During the melee Captain Keel suffered scratches to his neck and arm as well as a bite mark.  Flight First Officer Friedrich Preiler told the trial that the Captain’s shirt was left blood-stained after the incident. Ms Roberts tried to get into the cockpit while her daughter and the pilot were on the floor, but was held back by Mr Chkerdaa. Mitaiare and her mother were taken away off the plane by police officers who were nearby escorting a prisoner who was being extradited. Delivering her verdicts, District Judge Deborah Wright said: “Although neither of the defendants gave evidence at the trial I am satisfied that, through the interview of Ms Roberts and the prepared statement of Ms Mitaiare, both have raised the issue of self defence and defence of another and it is for the Crown to disprove those defences. “I find that Miss Mitaiare was very upset about the refusal of staff at Zurich airport to allow her to board the plane with her buggy. “After the flight landed , Ms Mitaiare was still exorcised by not being allowed to take her buggy onto the plane and she remonstrated with Mr Chkerdaa, demanding the names of the staff at the airport which he as unable to give.  “He offered her his own business card so that she could complain formally. I also accepted his evidence that she had said that Swiss people were racist and that what had happened was because she was a black woman travelling with a child. “I am satisfied that Captain Keel came out of the cockpit, offered Ms Mitaiare his business card and asked her to leave the plane. “I am also satisfied that in doing so he touched her arm or shoulder to guide her to the door. “It may well be that this was unwise, but I am satisfied that the touching was not any more than a minimal contest and that Ms Mitaiare’s reaction was wholly disproportionate. “The video footage is a testament to her anger and determination to continue to escalate a situation that was not getting out of hand. “I am aware of Ms Mitaiare’s frailties, but even allowing for that her reaction was wholly unacceptable. She was very far from being calm.

The album, which was unearthed by the family last year, contains some depictions of Nightingale, among the drawings by both families. The exhibition will also feature the watch that Nightingale wore throughout the Crimean War, on display for the first time.  Florence Nightingale Museum director David Green said: These two items bring us closer to two important aspects of Florenceaposs le - the Crimean War work which propelled her to fame, and her tight family bonds. The family album is a wonderful find ... Florenceaposs international fame endures because her achievements were utterly transformative and the whole exhibition is designed to surprise people whose knowledge of Florence Nightingale doesnapost go much beyond The Lady With The Lamp. Curators hope the exhibition, being staged  years after her birth, will shine a spotlight on Nightingale as an older woman.  Nightingale is often pictured in her thirties, when she nursed wounded soldiers in the Crimean War. The exhibition, in the grounds of St Thomasapos Hospital in London, aims to also remember the triumphs of the more mature woman. Nightingale rocketed to fame during the Crimean War, and became known as The Lady With The Lamp because she would check British soldiers throughout the night.  But she shunned the limelight and ed home as Mrs Smith. The new exhibition explores the next  years of her le, when she revolutionised nursing and transformed healthcare.

The couple tied the knot in  and ever since they have been happily married and love nothing more than sharing kisses and cuddles on their sofa. Maryanne and Tommyaposs marriage is described as a fairytale and the longest of anyone with their condition. And it was love at first sight for the adorable pair, who met at a le skills training centre in . Tommy was living in residential care after losing both his parents when he was just . But as soon as he met Maryanne, her parents took him under their wing and the pair became inseperable. A year and a half after they met, Tommy asked Maryanneaposs mum for permission to marry her daughter. He bought a plastic ring from a vending machine and proposed - Maryanne had no hesitation in saying yes. Her mum, Linda, explained: When I sent out the invitations people said it wouldn’t last and asked me what I’d doit didn’t. But we need to treat Tommy and Maryanne like adults. Everyone should be able to marry the love of their lives.” Their wedding was magical, with  guests. Maryanne said: We got married on July . I had a white dress and I wore a crown like a princess. And Tommy was in a suit with a shirt and tie. My wedding day was the best day of my le. I love my husband. He is my best friend.” Initially living with Linda, the couple got their own flat next door in . They spend their days going for walks on the beach close to their home in Southend-on-Sea in Essex and love to cook together. Linda says: “They would talk all the time, from the moment they woke up to the moment they went to sleep. I had to bang on the wall because they’d be in hysterics. “They also cooked with me every night and I taught them the basics of how to make fresh dinners. These two are marvellous in the kitchen. That’s where Tommy gets into his element.” While Tommy loves to cook, Maryanne is very house proud and admits she cleans every day. The couple are also huge fans of Elvis and their home is filled with memorabilia. Tommy makes sure he sings Love Me Tender to his we every, single day. After renewing their wedding vows on their th anniversary, Tommy and Maryanne make sure they do something special to mark the day every year. But heartbreakingly, Tommy, , has now been diagnosed with dementia, which means he struggles with some every day tasks like washing his hair.

Claims a civil servant who took an overdose was ignored by the Party adds to the growing impression that the Tories are quick to accuse other parties of wrongdoing, but ignore ­unacceptable behaviour in their own ranks. When complaints against the Home ­Secretary are heard from three departments, it increasingly sounds asshe is far more than just an assertive right-winger. Bullying is counter-productive as well as wrong. Johnson sticking by Patel is a self-defeating act he’ll deservedly come to regret. Sick pay vital No one should miss out on sick pay or millions might be forced to go to work just to survive while suffering from the ­coronavirus – furthering its spread. Unless the lowest paid, people on zero hours and the self-employed are covered, the Government is creating a dangerous hole in defences against an unpredictable threat. Delaying the release of the new Bond movie, No Time To Die, is a relatively small move in the grand scheme of precautions, but, ­nevertheless, very telling.

Estate agent Claire Louise Ainsworth, , betrayed Jenner Scott, , after she was tasked with selling her home in Accrington, Lancashire, a court has heard.Ainsworth - who runs UK Online Agents Ltd - sold the property for £, but told Mrs Scott the deal was only worth £,, Lancashire Live reports.Burnley Crown Court heard how apospure greedapos led to Ainsworth, of New Lane, Oswaldtwistle pocketing the dference for herself. Her actions left Mrs Scott, who had previously bought and sold two houses through Ainsworthaposs business, feeling distraught and often tearful. Prosecuting, Stephen Parker told the court that Mrs Scott had considered the businesswoman - who was tasked with selling the house in Whalley Road in December  - a friend who she confided in. Mr Parker said: She told Mrs Scott that the selling price was £, while telling the purchaser that the price was £, plus an additional £, in cash. The fraud was uncovered when Mrs Scott later visited her former home to pick up any post and met the new owner, who mentioned the £, in cash, to which she replied aposI don’t know what you’re on aboutapos. Police were called and in an interview after her arrest Ainsworth denied any fraud. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Scott said she felt ‘totally betrayed’ by the agent, who ‘took advantage of my vulnerability’. She added: I’m often tearful about it. I can’t understand why she would do this to me. I’m sure that the stress of this caused a severe attack of shingles and my weight has dropped to seven stone. Ainsworth, a mum-of-two, was found guilty of one count of fraud by  representation last month. She had denied the charge and was convicted in her absence after failing to turn up for her scheduled trial. She had no previous convictions.Defending, Christopher Hudson said his clientaposs conviction had been ‘catastrophic for her family and her business’, which he said had now been wound down. He said her actions had been a aposone-offapos and that she had later transferred back £, of the cash taken to the house buyer on the advice of a solicitor. He said: She is a decent and talented estate agent. The business was very successful. She built it up and now she’s knocked it down with self-induced greed. This was a one-off. She essentially is the business as photographer, valuer and negotiator so it has now come to an end. It has no assets. Recorder Mary Prior QC told Ainsworth that she had ‘lied to everybody’ about the house sale and that her motive was greed as she was not in dire straits financially and at the time of the offence and was ‘in a good place in her le’. She said: Nobody now is going deal with an estate agent with a conviction for fraud. Ainsworth was sentenced to a nine month jail sentence, suspended for  months and ordered to perform  hours of unpaid work. She was also ordered to pay £, in compensation to Mrs Scott. Speaking after the court hearing, Mrs Scott said she did not knowshe could ever trust anyone again. I cannot believe she was so pre-meditated about all of this. I thought I could trust her, she said.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/KMil_ADHD_Support-003-scaled.jpg ","title":"dundee adhd group aims to support undiagnosed women with special event this week","story":"It#s a condition that effects hundreds of thousands of adults in Scotland.Yet women can find themselves struggling to get a diagnosis of ADHD, with their symptoms often being misrepresented as depression or anxiety, partly because it is more commonly associated withNow, ahead of International Woman#s Day on Sunday, the Dundee and Angus ADHD Support Group is organising a special event aimed at bringing together women who are living with the condition and to raise awareness of what help is available in the city.Sarah McIlravey, who is the group#s Dundee project manager of the group, sat down with the Tele to speak about the challenges faced by woman and girls living with the condition, and how ADHD can impact the lives of those who are diagnosed with it.Dundee ADHD group gets Scottish lottery grant\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-adhd-group-gets-scottish-lottery-grant embed # secretJfkpjENiJ\" data-secret\"JfkpjENiJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"#Overall, there is less awareness of what the symptoms in females are so people might not recognise it as easily as they would do in men,# she said.#It#s more common for females to present dferent symptoms such as being less hyper-active.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself. Anyone  in the category absolutely deserved to win, so it really is an honour.#Throughout high school, Josh was a victim of bullying, struggling to understand who he was as a person and confused by his own thoughts and feelings.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

The glass came well back. At a quarter to eight we heard a poor weather forecast with gales and rain for practically every area including north-easters for both Malin and Hebrides. In the news that followed we heard that Moyanawas in trouble on her way home and was asking for help as she would have to be abandoned.As there was no hurry about moving as we meant to wait for the flood and there was obviously little enjoyment to be had on deck we turned over and went to sleep again. We hoped to make Tobermory in the late afternoon having the flood with us all the way andthings got no worse.At half past nine we began to turn out. A cold strong north-westerly was blowing but it was dry. Seewolf had sailed for Oban but Lindisfarne was still with us with Guy still shoutingand singing with undiminished enthusiasm. The Saguenay was not happy – a man was crouching in her cockpit with the lead line in his hand keeping watch for the first sign of dragging.We had a breakfast of grapefruitand bacon and eggs. One of the eggs when broken into a cup was so rotten it nearly blew the Pilot out of the forecastle.After our meal we had a big clean up above and below and the Tar pumped the ship then, with the wind falling light, the rain started again and blankets etc. up on deck to air had to come down in a hurry, but the glass was beginning to show signs of being somewhere near the bottom for the time being.The Tanky and Tar took shelter in the dog-house with the Major and talked of this and that while the rest of us occupied ourselves below. The Bosun and Pilot finished putting the tacklines in the flags, the former got a book while the latter started sketching. The Skipper had a patent lighter that could be used in any weather no matter how blowy or how wet, but which, when working emitted a series of sparks and this was the subject of one of the sketches. The Mate fitted up a tumbler holder in the ladies cabin then did some knitting, the Skipper, after cutting the tacklines to the requiredhad a snooze.At two o’clock by which time it was calm and raining less heavily, the Tanky and Mate started getting our dinner of lamb salad, greengages and custard, coffee and Yo-Yo biscuits, ready and the Pilot and Skipper tried mixing gin and Dubonnet but decided that to do so merely spoilt good gin. The Tanky, however, seemed to enjoy Dubonnet by itself and she was given the freedom of the bottle. About this time the man in the Saguenay got tired of holding his lead line and he shted billet to inshore from us.When we started lunch it was almost a flat calm, but coming on deck after it ready to go onto Tobermory, we found the wind had risen considerably and had veered a point. We got our anchor at four o’clock and under engine went out into the Sound of Mull and, turning west, began to get up our sails as we passed the Morven Pier.In view of the forecast and of what we could see ahead of us we decided to tie down two reefs. We got the tack and clew lashed down and had started on the reef points when we began to doubt the wisdom of proceeding. The wind was fresh and getting stronger every minute and the sea was increasing similarly – to go on would mean getting a proper hammering and the prospect of a north-east gale would mean our intended anchorage in Tobermory would probably be most uncomfortable .The decision of whether to turn back or not was left to the Skipper for as usual, on these occasions, the Pilot steadfastly refused to offer any opinion, but he did agree that the Skipper was right when he decided on the former course. Round we came, the jib was broken out, and we scampered back to Loch Aline. At the narrows the jib was furled and under engine only we ran up to Kinlochaline and let go off the boat-house at ten past five. The Mate, Tanky, and Tar, down below and unaware of our change of plan were quite bewildered when they heard the chain run out and the first named came on deck to find out where we had got to.The Saguenay had preceded us to this anchorage and the Lindisfarne came up a little later and Guy said that Kyle Bay, in the rapidly rising gale, was getting almost untenable. In Kinlochaline we were very comfortable though, even here there was quite a lop on the water and we were sheering about a good deal in the squalls. It was raining very heavily but the Bosun took the Major ashore, but still without any concrete results.At six we had a cup of tea with cake and biscuits and by the time this was finished it was blowing a full gale. The weather forecast was bad and our only consolation was that it was ever so much worse for the South.In the Channel the barometer had reached a record low level for July and force  and  winds were commonly reported all over England and Wales. With us the glass had turned and was . up since mid-day. Then with the exceptions of the Bosun who was in the dog-house and the Tar who played patience we spent the next hour or so dosing in the cabin.At half past eight we had a supper of scrambled eggs and meat roll for those that wanted it, then we put up the tents and down the angel and veered a further five fathoms of chain, making it twenty out in three fathoms of water.We could see out in the Sound of Mull that a huge sea was running and down by the narrows the top of the water was being swept off in spindrt. The squalls where we were were very fierce but, there being no sea, we were lying quite comfortably and never once put a pull on the anchor though we did suffer rather badly from bobstayitis.Two motor boats came up for shelter. One, Ormidale, anchored off the west shore opposite us, but the otherlet go out in the middle of the loch and kept steaming to her anchor for as long as we could see her.It was a wild night and at eleven o’clock to cheer himself up the Bosun made coffee for himself and the Pilot and half a cupful for the Tanky. While they were having it the rest of us started to turn in.That gale was news and in our sheltered corner we had no idea how bad it was. Even in Crinan warps were carried away and yachts set adrt in the basin. All round the coast were reports of vessels in distress one, a steamer in the Channel, being rolled right over.Next week:"},{"url":null,"title":"mr-roland-brett---appreciation","story":"THE business and sporting communities of the Scottish Borders have lost one of their leading lights following the death on February  of RolandBrett. He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

The Russian military had no immediate comment on the claim, but it has staunchly denied similar previous claims insisting it hasnrsquot targeted residential areas.The fighting in Idlib comes as the most severe test to Russia-Turkey ties since the crisis triggered by Turkeyrsquos downing of a Russian warplane near the Syrian border in November .Russia responded with an array of sweeping economic sanctions, cutting the flow of its tourists to Turkey and banning most Turkish exports, a punishment that eventually forced Turkey to back off and offer apologies.Turkey cannot afford a replay of that costly crisis, far less a military conflict with a nuclear power, but it has a strong position to bargain with.Moscow needs Ankara as a partner in a Syrian settlement and Russiarsquos supply routes

compromise on Idlib could see Mr Assad retain control over the key M highway, which his forces claimed in the latest offensive.The road that spans Syria linking Damascus with Aleppo, the countryrsquos commercial capital, is essential for Mr Assad to consolidate his rule.In a sign that the Kremlin firmly intends to secure control of the M, earlier this week Russian military police have deployed to a

appearing on s to taking steps to stop the live streaming of abuse, and identying and stopping grooming and predatory behaviour.As the proposals were launched in the US, they were endorsed by tech giants including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, TikTok, Twitter and Snap.The technology firms who have endorsed the scheme have said they will now promote and support them, as well as taking part in a collaboration between government and industry to help create a safer online environment.Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ldquoIt is truly horric that thousands of sick paedophiles are preying on vulnerable children from across the world.ldquoThis scandal requires our global partners to work together, and these principles provide a blueprint for delivering just that.ldquoI want this landmark collaboration across borders and sectors to define a stronger, new, united approach.The Government is currently also working on new legislation around online harms, including placing a statutory duty of care on tech companies to keep their users safe, overseen by an independent regulator.The voluntary principles set out by the collection of governments are seen as a way of clearly focusing global efforts to improve online safety, beyond legislation in specic countries.Security minister James Brokenshire said: ldquoWe cannot allow children to fall victim to predators who lurk in the shadows of the web.ldquoThrough global collaboration and with enhanced action from the five countries, law enforcement agencies and tech companies, we will ensure that children are protected online.WeProtect

sharing of skills and resources to support a safe online environment.ldquoThe voluntary principles outline a high-level framework that can be consistently applied across sectors and services to respond to changing societal and offending behaviours ndash and reduce risks for users.ldquoThis is one of our many efforts to protect children both online and off.ldquoKeeping children safe from online sexual exploitation and abuse is critically important and can only be achieved through cross-sector collaboration.Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of online safety charity the Internet Watch

principles are a welcome step in ensuring that internet companies in the Five Eyes countries are truly doing all that they can to prevent the spread of child sexual abuse material online.ldquoWhen our member companies join the IWF, they make a voluntary commitment to do all that they can to keep their customers safe and remove this abhorrent content as quickly as possible.ldquoIt is our hope that

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC.

At the time of writing this report officers would not recommend introducing a levy where there is a fragile economy and depopulation issues.‘This provision will be more effective in urban areas, particularly large towns and cities.‘It may not be effective within the Argyll and Bute Council area unless improvements are made to transport infrastructure, specically public transport provision, to allow the modal sht to be made from cars to other travel types.‘Improvements to the cycle’s network may also be worth considering in this context.‘The introduction of levies may, in some cases, lead to displacement of vehicles on to public roadsparking costs are passed on to staff.’The report also says that assessments would need to be carried out in order for any penalty charge notices for pavement parking to be implemented.Ms Flanagan added: ‘Pavement parkingis an area which would require a policy position for Argyll and Bute, in terms of what level of enforcement and where enforcement would be carried out.‘It is understood there will be minimum footway widths to be maintainedwhich won’t leave many places within Argyll and Bute where we could have footway or partial footway parking.‘There would be a need for an assessment to be carried out in local areas where we are aware that the prohibition may cause issues.‘The council would have to promote orders, provide signing and lining these may become cost pressures.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed.

Edinburgh University, astonishingly, failed to support her.The gay tennis icon Martina Navratilova was expelled from the LGBT group, Athlete Ally, for saying that people with male physiques should not complete in womenrsquos sport.Cultural and health bodies, and even the Scottish Government, were ceasing to use the very word ldquowoman in case it offended male-bodied transwomen. Bizarre substitutes like ldquowomxn, ldquomenstruators and ldquociswomen were being deployed in the cause of inclusivity.Well, times change. This issue is now out in the open. More and more women are speaking out against the undermining of sex-based rights.Even the ultra-wokeis permitting columns from feminists like Suzanne Moore calling for an end to the ldquono ing of gender-critical academics like Professor Selina Todd and Dr Kathleen Stock. They have been labelled as ldquoTerfs by trans zealots.Last week, the UK Government called a halt to self-identication legislation south of the Border. Ministers discovered that children as young as  are being given puberty blockers by gender reassignment clinics. Puberty blockers halt the sexual development of children. They are of the class of drugs once used as chemical castration for sex offenders.Influential figures in the SNP, like the former communications guru, Kevin Pringle, are now urging Nicola Sturgeon to follow the UK Government. But the Scottish Equalities Secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, apparently intends to press ahead with legislation to allow self-ID. Mr Pringle is speaking for many in the party who now realise that the growing backlash against Self-ID could threaten the SNPrsquos chances in next yearrsquos Holyrood elections.Yet it seemed glaringly obvious to me two years ago that women would never accept this existential assault on their sexual identity. How could they be expected to accept people with male genitalia and masculine physiques as real women  Why should women be forced to accept male-bodied transwomen in their protected spaces, in changing rooms and toilets Indeed, at first I thought this proposition that transwomen were literally women was just anti-trans scaremongering. Surely activists werenrsquot actually saying that they were biologically female I learned the hard way that this is precisely what they were saying. I was repeatedly accused of hate speech for suggesting that this would mean the removal of human biology from the school curriculum.Political leaders like Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens and the former leader of the Liberal Democrats Jo Swinson continue to insist that people with penises can be and are actually female. Labourrsquos Shadow Equalities Secretary, Dawn Butler, said last month that ldquobabies are born without a sex. This is pure flat earthism.Shamefully, leading feminists like Germaine Greer have been ldquocancelled for objecting to extreme transgenderism as misogyny. That it demeans and invalidates women.How could someone with a male body possibly experience social reality in the way real women do  Transwomen do not have uteruses, do not menstruate, do not give birth.Trans advocates reply that, well, some women canrsquot give birth and some women donrsquot menstruate. This is ridiculous and offensive sophistry. Asa woman ceases to be a womanshe canrsquot have children.These canards are still re on social media with people arguing that clown fish changing sex, and people born intersex ldquoprovethat there is no fixed biological definition of sex.Humans are of course mammals, not fish. The existence of a minuscule number of people born intersexdoesnrsquot alter the fact that . per cent of humans are born male or female.Humans are a binary species. We are not hermaphrodites. Sexual dferentiation is the basis of human reproduction. That this needs to be said is a shocking reflection on the intellectual integrity of the left. Many supposedly sensible people have been morally coerced into accepting something they know to be untrue. It is deeply worrying.Most SNP politicians know that transgender ideology is nonsense. They keep quiet partly because of fear of Britainrsquos onerous hate speech laws.It has been left to genuinely courageous women like Joan McAlpine MSP and Joanna Cherry, MP, to fight for reason. For doing so they have been the target of astonishing abuse on social media, and from the trans activists embedded in the SNP.Academics like Lucy Hunter Blackburn have bravely challenged the proposal to remove the question on sex from the national census.This has nothing to do with ldquotransgender rights. Trans people are free to identy as anyone they wish. No one is stopping them wearing what they want or loving who they wish. This is not homophobia ..In fact, advocates of Self-ID, like Stonewall, have set back the cause of trans rights by harnessing it to a quasi-religious dogma.Mr Pringle and others in the SNP now realise that the Scottish Government is marching into a minefield by persevering with Self-ID without proper debate. Given the pause in England, it could lead to a transgender Gretna Green.But there is an equitable solution. Of course allow transwomen to identy as female without needless bureaucratic obstacles. But the Government should make clear in the legislation reforming the Gender Recognition Act that this does not mean abolishing the biological definition of sex or infringing womenrsquos sex-based rights under the Equalities Act.Yoursquod think that a feminist like Nicola Sturgeon would regard that as self-evident. Perhaps she does.

The rest, as they say, is history. Except, in the case of the Tudor dynasty, this is a period thatrsquos never allowed to die. And in Henryrsquos case, as everyone knows, Anne Boleyn was only the second bite on his kebab.The publication of the final part of Hilary Mantelrsquos Thomas Cromwell trilogy, The Mirror  the Light, has been treated asitrsquos breaking news. The antics of the rapacious Henry VIII and his Machiavellian chief minister took place nearly  years ago, yet the airwaves, review and feature pages, and even fashion spreads are dominated by talk of the Tudors. Whether itrsquos their backstabbing ambition, headbands and bodices, or iron-fisted bureaucracy, weto them again and again, like birds to a hollow coconut shell, hoping for another flake.Mantelrsquos work is as thorough and intense an exploration of the political mind as yoursquoll find. That the previous two books in the series won the Booker Prize indicates their artistic merit as well as their accuracy. Those who donrsquot feel Cromwell merits so many pages might be surprised to find themselves hooked. And, although the factual detail is so well-founded the trilogy could become set texts for students, this is the past recast by the authorrsquos imagination. Official, dispassionate, unspun history it is not.Mantelrsquos portrayal of Henryrsquos sleekit, ruthless, tight-lipped consigliere has parallels with people in power today. Those echoes, and the entanglements of a murderous but exquisitely dressed court, are where the perennial fascination with Henryrsquos entourage lies. That his time on the throne was soon to be followed by Elizabeth Irsquos long tenure has ensured that,this era is to your taste, therersquos enough to chew on for a letime. Yet dramatic and richly brocaded as all this is, havenrsquot we now had enough  Isnrsquot it time to look where, and bid the Tudors farewell Historical fiction sounds like a timeless niche, untroubled by tides of fashion. As Mantelrsquos supremacy shows, however, it is as susceptible to fads as everything . There was a time when the Tudors were considered dusty and tired. Mention of Henryrsquos six wives or the Spanish Armada conjured up Jean Plaidy and school lessons: interestingthat was your kind of thing, but hardly thrilling or new.Writers in this genre are in a tricky situation. Publishers want them to be original yet follow the road more travelled, to mine a popular seam but make it their own. If nothing , Mantelrsquos oeuvre is a masterclass in how to go about this. Yet some years ago, before her meteoric rise, it seemed the appetite for Tudor was waning. The German market, a literary agent told me, had overdosed and lost interest in buying the rights to anything further from this era. Then Mantel rekindled the flame to such an extent that today, from Hamburg to Heidelberg, she will be in bookshop windows, kept company on the shelves by best-selling Alison Weir and Philippa Gregory, both of whom have also made Hampton Court their second home.And, just as the pitiless English royals in farthingales and ruffs are enjoying their moment in the sun, so too is anything set during the two world wars, or in Victoriarsquos later years. Like children who ask for the same story every bedtime, it seems that readers love nothing better than retreading old ground before they douse the lights.Most genre novels are looked down on by the literati as second class citizens. That is why Mantelrsquos Booker victories offered such encouragement for others ploughing a similar furrow. Yet having written historical fiction myself, set in the early th-century Borders, I have reservations: not about the calibre or worth of the genre, but about how it ranks with fiction that comes almost entirely from the writerrsquos imagination.As Andrew Marr said of The Mirror  the Light, the ending is never in doubt. The same goes for aspects of all books in which real-le figures play a part. When it comes to plotting, these fixed points become the beads on the rosary between which the narrative is threaded. They might cause problems when interweaving made-up with documented events, but they provide an off-the-peg outline around which to build a story. Writers portraying modern le through invented characters do not have this luxury. All they can rely upon are their powers of invention and the quality of their prose. To my mind, despite the spadework needed when researching previous centuries, that is a much harder act to pull off.With the Tudors dominating the bestseller lists, what astonishes me most is how little of our history fiction has yet covered. In this country alone there is material for libraries of new novels set in the centuries before the Stewarts claimed the throne, and long after the Jacobites retreated to their peaty hovels. The past might well be a foreign country, as L P Hartley wrote, but some areas seem to attract package holiday tours, leaving tumbleweed to roll through the rest."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11107853.jpg?type=article-full","title":"turn-rock-legends-genesis-play-scotland-reunion-tour","story":"The Last Domino  Tour  starts in Dublin on November  and finishes at the Glasgow SSE Hydro on December .ldquoTherersquos a Genesis sound which is still there, said guitarist Mike Rutherford. ldquoI missed it, itrsquos nice to play it again.The reunion will see Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford tour for the first time in  years.Their last live out was the globe-trotting, sell-out Turn It On Again: The Tour in .They will be joined on stage by Phil Collins -year-old son Nic on drums, and the bands long time guitar and bass player Daryl Stuermer.ldquoHe [Nic] plays like me and he kind of has the same attitude as me, said Collins. ldquoSo that was a good starter.Asked about the songs that the could play, Collins said: ldquoThere are songs you feel you have to play because the audience would feel cheatedyou didnrsquot, then itrsquos a question of putting the rest of the stuff together from songs we havenrsquot played for a long time.Genesis are one of the worldrsquos biggest selling and most successful bands of all time.

Professor Massimo Galli, the director of infectious diseases at Sacco hospital in Milan, said Italyrsquos comparatively high elderly population could have left it more vulnerable to the virus.Italy has the highest le expectancy in Europe at  for men and  for women.Mr Galli said: ldquoItaly is a country of old people.

While many people globally have built up immunity to seasonal flu strains, Covid is a new virus to which no-one has immunity.ldquoThat means more people are susceptible to infection, and some will suffer severe disease.ldquoGlobally, about . per cent of reported Covid- cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than % of those infected.The lack of a vaccine was another major obstacle in the fight against Covi, said Mr Adhanom.Although numerous research efforts are under way worldwide, the clinical trials to ensure effectiveness and safety mean any immunisation programme is unlikely to be ready until  at the earliest.However, Mr Adhanom stressed that unlike influenza ldquocontainment is possible and that the evidence so far suggests that the virus does not spread as easily as flu.The WHO also revealed important developments in relation to how the virus presents.There have been suggestions that there could be large numbers of infected people in China without symptoms, potentially skewing scientistsrsquo efforts to count the incidence and estimate mortality rates.Mr Adhanom said this did not appear to be the case, but encouraged other nations to carry out mass surveillance.He said: ldquoEvidence from China is that only % of reported cases do not have symptoms, and most of those cases develop symptoms within two days. Some countries are looking for cases of Covid- using surveillance systems for influenza and other respiratory diseases.ldquoCountries such as China, Ghana, Singapore and where have found very few cases of Covid- among such samples ndash or no cases at all.ldquoThe only way to be sure is by looking for Covid- antibodies in large numbers of people, and several countries are now doing those studies.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Russian military had no immediate comment on the claim, but it has staunchly denied similar previous claims insisting it hasnrsquot targeted residential areas.The fighting in Idlib comes as the most severe test to Russia-Turkey ties since the crisis triggered by Turkeyrsquos downing of a Russian warplane near the Syrian border in November .Russia responded with an array of sweeping economic sanctions, cutting the flow of its tourists to Turkey and banning most Turkish exports, a punishment that eventually forced Turkey to back off and offer apologies.Turkey cannot afford a replay of that costly crisis, far less a military conflict with a nuclear power, but it has a strong position to bargain with.Moscow needs Ankara as a partner in a Syrian settlement and Russiarsquos supply routes for its forces in Syria lie through the Turkish Straits.Moscow also hopes to use Ankara in its standoff with the West.Last year, Turkey became the first Nato country to take delivery of sophisticated Russian air defence missile systems, angering the United States.Turkey has put its deployment on hold amid the crisis in Idlib.The talks in Moscow will mark the th encounter in just over a year between Mr Putin and Mr Erdogan, who call each other ldquodear friend and have polished a fine art of bargaining. vw,vw,px, px\"Civilians flee from Idlib toward the north to find safety inside Syria Last October, they reached an agreement to deploy their forces across Syriarsquos northeastern border to fill the void left by President Donald Trumprsquos abrupt withdrawal of US forces.Prior to that they had negotiated a series of accords that saw opposition fighters from ious areas in Syria move into Idlib and in  carved out a de-escalation zone in Idlib.They blamed one another for the collapse of the Idlib deal, with Moscow holding Ankara responsible for letting al Qaida linked militants launch attacks from the area and Turkey accusing Moscow of failing to rein in Mr Assad.A possible compromise on Idlib could see Mr Assad retain control over the key M highway, which his forces claimed in the latest offensive.The road that spans Syria linking Damascus with Aleppo, the countryrsquos commercial capital, is essential for Mr Assad to consolidate his rule.In a sign that the Kremlin firmly intends to secure control of the M, earlier this week Russian military police have deployed to a strategic town of Saraqeb sitting on the road to ward off any Turkish attempt to retake it.In , Mr Putin could accept the presence of Turkey-backed militants in the areas alongside the border and put brakes for now on Mr Assadrsquos attempts to claim full control over Idlib.copy -.

keeping children safe on the internet, created by a collection of governments, has been unveiled and endorsed by major technology companies.The UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have formally launched the Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, which detail actions tech companies should take to protect younger users on their s.The pledges range from stopping existing and new child sex abuse material appearing on s to taking steps to stop the live streaming of abuse, and identying and stopping grooming and predatory behaviour.As the proposals were launched in the US, they were endorsed by tech giants including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, TikTok, Twitter and Snap.The technology firms who have endorsed the scheme have said they will now promote and support them, as well as taking part in a collaboration between government and industry to help create a safer online environment.Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ldquoIt is truly horric that thousands of sick paedophiles are preying on vulnerable children from across the world.ldquoThis scandal requires our global partners to work together, and these principles provide a blueprint for delivering just that.ldquoI want this landmark collaboration across borders and sectors to define a stronger, new, united approach.The Government is currently also working on new legislation around online harms, including placing a statutory duty of care on tech companies to keep their users safe, overseen by an independent regulator.The voluntary principles set out by the collection of governments are seen as a way of clearly focusing global efforts to improve online safety, beyond legislation in specic countries.Security minister James Brokenshire said: ldquoWe cannot allow children to fall victim to predators who lurk in the shadows of the web.ldquoThrough global collaboration and with enhanced action from the five countries, law enforcement agencies and tech companies, we will ensure that children are protected online.WeProtect Global Alliance, a group comprised of  governments,  technology companies and  civil society organisations, has also said it will promote the new principles across the industry and support the initiative.The announcement comes against a backdrop of growing concern about the safety of young people online.According to figures from the NSPCC published earlier this year, around  online abuse crimes against children have been recorded every day since the Government introduced its online harms white paper last year.Responding to the announcement of the voluntary principles, video  TikTok said: ldquoProtecting against the threat of online child sexual exploitation and abuse is an issue that requires a global response, including collaboration between governments and industry, and the sharing of skills and resources to support a safe online environment.ldquoThe voluntary principles outline a high-level framework that can be consistently applied across sectors and services to respond to changing societal and offending behaviours ndash and reduce risks for users.ldquoThis is one of our many efforts to protect children both online and off.ldquoKeeping children safe from online sexual exploitation and abuse is critically important and can only be achieved through cross-sector collaboration.Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of online safety charity the Internet Watch Foundation, said: ldquoThe IWF assists companies by providing services that fit their business needs and helps them keep their services free from child sexual abuse material.ldquoThese voluntary principles are a welcome step in ensuring that internet companies in the Five Eyes countries are truly doing all that they can to prevent the spread of child sexual abuse material online.ldquoWhen our member companies join the IWF, they make a voluntary commitment to do all that they can to keep their customers safe and remove this abhorrent content as quickly as possible.ldquoIt is our hope that these principles will encourage more companies to follow the lead of our members and step up and do the right thing for victims of child sexual abuse.The National Crime Agencyalso welcomed the new principles, calling them an ldquoimportant milestone in the fight against child abuse online.Rob Jones, director of threat leadership at the NCA said the agency had seen an increase in the ldquoscale, complexity and severity of such content.ldquoTo stop the pathway of escalation into severe offending, there must be zero tolerance of the presence of child sexual abuse on industry s, with industry reinforcing this at every level to raise the bar to offending, he said.ldquoThe NCA also welcomes parallel work to progress online harms legislation, which will place a statutory duty of care on tech companies to keep their users safe online, overseen by an independent regulator.copy -.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow. The route had been changed because of severe weather over the previous week, making for a course that was very heavy underfoot and flooded in several places.Todd managed to get to the front of the queue at the line and set off at a steady pace, settling in to a position within the top  or so runners after the initial surge.Over the next  minutes she maintained her form and starting easing her way up through the field to settle in sixth place as the runner approached the final quarter of the race.As the finish was coming into sight, Todd started to kick for home and her efforts were rewarded as she moved up to fourth and battled all the way to the finish line to maintain that position, getting it on the line with no more than a foot’sfrom the athlete in fth place.Coach David Wagstaff said it was a fantastic achievement for the youngster, who was not only a great prospect for the future in athletics but also an aspiring triathlete who was doing well on the junior circuit.Todd and her parents thanked NorthLink Ferries, without whose generous sponsorship participation in the cross country championships would not have been possible..."},{"url":null,"title":"advertising sales representative full and part time at the shetland times ","story":"The Shetland Times Ltd is looking for a bright, enthusiastic and energetic advertising sales representative who must be a team player.This is a full-time post,  hours per week, am-pm Monday-Thursday, am-pm Friday.It is an opportunity to sell our range of promotional packages to current clients and prospective customers.As a part of our sales team you will meet clients face to face on a regular basis as well as make telephone sales calls.You will play a key role in selling and administering advertising and promotional offers.and is capable of meeting ious publication deadlines.A good understanding of Microsoft Office suite, keyboard skills and high levels of literacy and spelling are expected.Marketing sales experience would be an advantage.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March . Tickets are priced at £ which includes a three-course meal and champagne reception. For those not wanting to partake in the meal, £ is payable at the door. Tickets are available from the Devenish reception or by contacting Danielmcginley@gmail.Alanna’s Hidden Hope will be available on iTunes, single priced at £..Proceeds raised on the night will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group and PIPS Charity.

There#s nothing to be found.Not a single pharmacy had any in stock, with one pharmacist saying she#s never seen demand like it in  years behind the counter.Already the shelves are bare in the high street chemist stores.Across the UK, Boots limited sales to two per customer last week as the panic-buying set in - but the entire product range remains out of stock across the country.A quick check on their website and the messages range from #sorry temporarily out of stock# to #stock sold out# or #stock coming soon#.We#ve found hand sanitiser incredibly dficult to source.

We were promised a supply last week and it arrived on Monday, but we didn#t even get them out of the box before they were gone.

They simply don#t have it and have no idea when they#ll be able to get it. One pharmacist tells us that the demand has been almost constant and it seems your best bet for picking up the most sought after product in Northern Ireland is to keep turning up in the hope of striking it lucky.A final call to east Belfast and on the Newtownards Road guess what  We have placed an order, said Amy Robinson at McDonald#s Pharmacy.

The party#s director of finance Des Mackin told The  Sinn Fein has experienced a surge in membership applications since the Irish general election in February and now expects to recruit more staff on the basis of increased representation in Leinster House. Sinn Fein#s finances will soon further improve as money continues to be released from the estate of the late WilliamHampton, who gted millions to the party after his death in a nursing home in Wales in January . It#s thought the estate of the eccentric millionaire which benefited Sinn Fein to the tune of £m is worth at least twice that amount after the discovery of leads involving more than two dozen bank accounts globally. Money held in UK accounts has already been given to the party.

The whole thing should be done by the end of the year.Rules around political funding mean the money cannot be spent in the Republic but will boost Sinn Fein#s financial position. The executors of Mr Hampton#s will were Mr Mackin and prominent Belfast republican Joe Cahill, both Sinn Fein national treasurers at the time. As well as four headquarter buildings in Dublin and Belfast, local branches of the party own a further  or so properties used as constituency offices. Mr Mackin said the party has received , membership applications and  applications to join its youth wing since the Irish general election was called - bringing total party membership to ,. He said Sinn Fein is able to employ more staff for the party because its activist ethos means people are prepared to work for less. Former party leader Gerry Adams is heading up a new unit within the party to ensure Sinn Fein remains focused on its ethos of achieving a united Ireland, he said. Everything should be thought of in terms of a united Ireland. It is important to ensure and promote the united Ireland vision, to make sure it goes right through and that all our policies are thought of in those terms, he said.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

All Flybe flights, and those operated by Stobart Air, have been cancelled. Therefore, anyone who has booked with Flybe from Belfast City Airport is advised not to go to the airport as your flight will not be operating. Flybe customers are therefore urged to make their own alternative travel arrangements via other airlines, rail or coach operators. For flights operated by Flybe franchise partnerspassengers should make contact with that airline to confirm your travel arrangements. googletag.cmd.push The UK Civil Aviation Authority will provide advice and information to consumers, so check their website and Twitter feed @UK_CAA for more information. Commenting, Richard Moriarty Chief Executive at the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: “This is a sad day for UK aviation and we know that Flybes decision to stop trading will be very distressing for all of its employees and customers. “We urge passengers planning to fly with this airline not to go to the airport as all Flybe flights are cancelled. For the latest advice, Flybe customers should visit the CAA website or the CAAs Twitter feed for more information. googletag.cmd.push “Flybe also operated a number of codeshare partnerships with international airlines. If you have an international ticket you should make contact with that airline to confirm your travel arrangements.” Reacting to the Flybe news, Jenner McKeever, Director of Airporter in Derry, said:“The news that Flybe has gone into administration is dreadful news. “Flybe has provided a vital service for thousands of commuters who use the airline on a regular basis to travel from Northern Ireland to work in Britain or further afield. “As a peripheral region, connectivity for NI is absolutely crucial, whether it’s to encourage inward investment, to encourage indigenous business to expand and sell to other markets, or to encourage more visitors to the region, flights into and out of Northern Ireland are key to investment, business growth and tourism. “The loss of this service will be hugely damaging to our economy because it breaks that connectivity from Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK. Not only does it make le harder for many businesses who rely on these regional routes, but it also will have an impact on our tourism industry at a time when we are trying to attract more visitors to our shores.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

Each visit brings a new opportunity and on what will be the first Derry game played on grass this season, Devine is hoping for a change in fortune at Waterford.“Theres a lot of excitement but we have got to make sure that the excitement that we are generating is also fulfilled with hard work and the ability to grind out results and that is key at this stage of the season,” he said. “Its not about the beautul game to be honest. Id rather go to Waterford which is a dficult venue and be able to dig out a brilliant win than be very expansive and pretty and lovely on the ball and come away with a - defeat.”Waterford are hoping to avoid a third successive home defeat as well as score their first home goal of the season, but Devine is just focusing on his team.“Its key for me that they continue to trust each other and continue to know each others strengths and weaknesses and to understand what way we want to evolve as a team. “Its very much a work in progress,” he explained.“It was fantastic that we got three points last week but the key now is going to get another three points. Its very dficult, we didnt win there last year, we threw away a - lead with  seconds in the game and we took the lead down there the last time and conceded a poor goal from a corner. “We didnt win in the RSC last year and we know its going to be extremely dficult down there this year because they are spitting a bit of fire as well. “They will be disappointed to have lost their last two, but they also showed a lot of quality when they went to St. Pats and won -.” googletag.cmd.push PotentialDevine is excited at the potential in his squad this season and he is expecting big things from the young players going forward.“Its a very young side – there were five players under  who finished the game,” he added. “A lot of them are playing in this league for then first time. The omens are good. I back these players and I back the players with a lot of experience to help these players. We had a great week last week but we now have to try and have another memorable night in the RSC.“You could go through the Waterford team and theres a lot of talent in there and a lot of experience, but theres also a lot of players who can hurt youyoure not right so were under no illusions. “Its going to be a big battle down here. Its our first game on grass so it has the makings of a fantastic game. I know Alan Reynolds very well and he will very determined that they dont lose three home games in a row.” Ciaran Collwill have a late fitness test ahead of tomorrows game, while Ally Gilchrist remains a doubt after suffering concussion against Bohemians. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both acts put on lively performances that were thoroughly enjoyed by the packed crowd, but Cumann Pheadar Naofa impressed the judges most with their eight-hand reel and were crowned champions.Next up was solo the singing and the standards were outstandingly high. Ardglass, Mayobridge , Mayobridgeand Saul were all represented in the category and from an audience point of view it would seem an impossible job for the judges to separate the performances.They did manage it though and Mayobridgersquos Eimear Magee took the title with a beautul performance of Orphan Girl.The recitation category followed and the audience was treated to four heartfelt performances from Attical, Saul, Darragh Cross and Rostrevor.Clare McCartan of Attical recited an extract from Frank McCourtrsquos Angelarsquos Ashes lsquoMy First Holy Communionrsquo and the performance filled the audience with both laughter and nostalgia, which resulted in Clare being declared champion.The audience were treated to four wonderful ballad performances from Ballymartin, Bryansford, Saul and Mayobridge.Every performance was flawless and the talent on stage was outstanding, but it was the experienced Saul group who were awarded first placen with two wonderful performances mdash Leaving The Blaskett Islands and Homeland.Before the interval Cumman Pheadar Naofa performed a set dance. Although they were the only performers in the category, they didnrsquot allow the standards to slip and their performance was enjoyed by all.After the interval, Drumaness, Attical, Clann Na Bann and Bryansford had the audience laughing and giggling with their novelty acts.There were male nuns on the run, an Irish wake with a dference and a club struggling to form a Scoacuter quiz team, but it was Bryansfordrsquos performance of lsquoThe Passport Officersquo that won the title after showing the audience what le is like in an Irish passport office and what it takes to prove your Irishness.The final category of the night was the instrumental music. Clann Na Banna, Attical, Cumann Pheadar Naofa and Mayobridge all competed and ended the show with a high.Cumann Pheadar Naofa stole the show with beautul performances of The Maid at the Spinning Wheel, Andersonrsquos Reel and The New Mown Meadows.The standard of performances at Scoacuter Sinsir this year has been exceptional and is a testimony to the vast amount of talented performers within Down and the time and dedication put in by GAA clubs at promoting and nurturing culture within the county.Another massive thank you must go out to all the volunteers who help make Scoacuter possible, from setting up the stage and sound, adjudicating, judging, doing Fir Ban Na Ti, providing hospitality, selling tickets, doing the door and so on.Finally, well done to all performers and good luck to all those who will compete in the Ulster Scoacuter semi-final in Glenullin next week..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Building.jpg","title":"Building work begins on ‘eyesore’ car park  ","story":"WORK has started on a new car park at the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick.A contractor is currently on site at the Strangford Road working on an area to the side and front of the remains of the townrsquos historic workhouse.The site of the former local authority base was being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles, but late last year planning permission was secured to formally designate the area as a car park for both council vehicles and staff cars.Concerned residents who live nearby had expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the old workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.Part of a main car park adjacent to the Orchard Way housing development will be used to form the main entrance to the proposed new grammar school campus.In papers submitted ahead of a planning meeting when formal approval for the new car park was granted, it was revealed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admitted that the car park plan would impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.But they confirmed that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accepted the parking plan in principle.In addition, government officials described the existing site used for parking as ldquowell established with the planning application seeking to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans parked at the side.The planning papers added: ldquoThe works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.The formal planning approval paves the way for council officials to relocate existing staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.As part of the sale of council land to the Education Authority, there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm when the new school is constructed and opens for business..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 Classy.jpg","title":"Classy Oisin helps Down into league showdown  ","story":"DOWN earned a well-deserved two points in Liatroim on Sunday afternoon and all but secured a place in the isional final.A mid-week change of venue to Liatroim meant this encounter was played on a pristine surface, ensuring a thrilling encounter, which Roacutenaacuten Sheehan said was a massive contributing factor to today win.ldquoIrsquod like to thank all in the Liatroim club, to take the game at such short notice was a credit to them. The facilities and the carpet like surface of Fontenoy Park was a massive boost for us today, and suited our fast-open style of play.Kildare knew that a nothing less than a win would be good enough and despite playing into the wind, were quickest out of the blocks, opening up a - to - lead in the opening quarter with Jack Sheridan and Brian Byrne frees punishing Down indiscretions.A fourth minute Chris Egan point being Downrsquos only score from play in the first quarter.Sheehan got his match-ups spot on, as Caolan Taggart and John McManus put the shackles on Kildarersquos James Burke and Sheridan to minimise any threat on goal.Down created lots of scoring opportunities in the first half, but just couldnrsquot convert them, whilst Danny Toner and midfielder Pearse Oacuteg McCrickard got through a trojan amount of work around the middle of the park to keep the pressure on the Lilywhites.Down hit a period of ascendancy inside the final five minutes of the half, trailing - to -, Danny Toner struck over from  metres on  minutes and after MacManus pointed from outside the  metre line, Ronan Costello broke free from the attentions of Rian Boran in added time to fire over the bar, when a goal could so easily have resulted.MacManus, playing on home soil, opened the scoring seconds into the restart, firing over from  metres, before adding a free a minute later,much to the pleasure of the local home support.Kildare nosed out in front again, only to see the first of three second half Conor Woods monster frees from deep inside the Down half and a Matt Conlon score, tie matters for the third time. McCrickard sent over a wondrous  metre side line for the lead score.But disaster struck minutes when Shane Ryan rounded Mark Patterson and his shot flew past Stephen Keith, Kildare were up by one.The game was finely balanced as Egan levelled for the hosts once more and with Kildare having a game in hand over Down and the dayrsquos prize a league final spot in two weeks, Paul Divilly scored Kildarersquos final point, but Down pushed for the line and got the last four scores, two MacManus frees and two more long distance strikes from the impressive Conor Woods.Roacutenaacuten Sheehan was impressed with his sides work rate: ldquoWe were slow to settle in the first  minutes, given this was the biggest test wersquove had since the Derry game, he said.ldquoEoghan Sands led up front, and although we missed two to three goal chances, we kept our composure in the tackle and kept plugging away, once more Danny Toner had a brilliant game and with the experience of Caolan Taggart and Darragh Mallon in defence, Kildare were going to have out work us for every score.Down: S Keith, M Patterson, J McManus, D Mallon, C Taggart, C Woods , G Hughes, M Conlon , P Oacuteg McCrickard , R Costello , R McCusker, D Toner , O MacManus , E Sands, C Egan .

Itrsquos the least we can do in his memory to promote his brainchild. Irsquom certain we could get the backing of everyonepermission is granted.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Down Council chairman, Mr Eddie McVeigh, has renewed his plea to local planners to help the Housing Executive rind sites for housing development in Ballynahinch.Mr McVeigh said the Executive were anxious to build in Ballynahinch, but they had been repeatedly thwarted because they had been unable to find sites which met with the plannersrsquo approval.Mr McVeigh was speaking after planners turned down an application from the Executive to build on the Magheraknock Road. The application was refused because the planners considered the site was outside the area considered suitable for residential development.The planners consider there is sufficient land available for residential development in Ballynahinch. This is the comment which constantly annoys Mr McVeigh.DOWNPATRICK mdash Controversy over road proposals for Downpatrick town centre can be settled by compromise, according to the local chamber of trade.Traders are strongly opposed to DoE Roads Service recommendations for a through road which were published in the Recorder last month.They dislike the thought of a main road with high retaining walls cutting the town in two and are keen to meet officials in the hope that agreement can be reached.Mr Jim Cassidy, newly elected chairman of Downpatrick Chamber of Trade, is quietly confident that the designersrsquo commendable ideas can be better merged with local needs as the business people and residents see them.ldquoThere is considerable opposition for very valid reasons to the plan, he said. ldquoWe believe that the town centre should not be carved up by a road crossing Scotch Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.ldquoThe feeling among members is that a major traffic route should by-pass Down Cathedral and join the Newcastle Road. Without doubt, the traffic load in the town must be eased.ldquoOurs is not a modern town, but has character that should not be destroyed in an attempt to modernise everything.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Town Committee is to throw its full weight behind an anti-litter campaign.The committee are considering launching a special design scheme for three schools in the town and are investigating the possibility of mapping out a programme to make local people more aware of the litter problem.The schoolsrsquo competition is an exciting idea aimed at getting pupils in the local high school and two primary schools to design a clean-up scheme, with prizes for the winners. A best kept garden competition is another idea.The town committee hopes to tie all the events into Down Councilrsquos anti-litter campaign later this year when a prize of pound will be awarded to the best kept town or village in the council area.Some members of the town committee, however, fear Killyleagh could get off to a bad start in the competition because of the major housing redevelopment schemes at Shore Street and Irish Street, and the overall shabby appearance of roads and footpaths in the area.DUNDRUM mdash Ambitious plans to make Dundrum Regatta and Sports bigger and better were drawn at the Regatta Committeersquos annual meeting in the Bay Inn on Monday night.Ideas to cater for teenagers, introduce a more ied programme and revert to a date in mid July were considered at the well attended meeting.Before the election of officers, which saw Mr Hugh Graham re-elected as chairman and Mr Pierce Rice appointed secretary, the committee congratulated Mr Dan McNeill for his -year association with the committee,  of which were spent as chairman.One of the more pleasing aspects to come out of the meeting was the formation of a group, to be known as the teenage committee, which will should out what teenagers want to see in the programme of events, this ensuring young, middle-aged and elderly will be catered for. The dates for this yearrsquos Regatta are July -.LOUGHINISLAND mdash Loughinisland hasnrsquot had a public phone kiosk since it was knocked down by a lorry three years ago.

The local development association say they have been conned mdash and  residents agree with them.The row relates to the possible side effects of the Department of the Environmentrsquos scheme to meet the townrsquos needs on whig work began last year and was abandoned a few months ago.For more than ten years there has been intense opposition to a sewerage collection tank located close to the townrsquos slipway.

Any fair minded assessment of its local track record over the last decade would be damning to say the least.ldquoRecords suggest that Invest NI has only hosted one potential investor in the local area in  years. That is an astonishing failure and an indictment on an organisation that appears to suffer nose bleeds once it moves beyond the Belfast area.ldquoIndeed, Invest NIrsquos focus appears to have been solely directed at throwing cash incentives at investors to locate in Belfast at the expense of incubating local small and medium enterprises in areas like South Down.Mr Hazzard claimed that South Down has been one of the worst performing areas in terms of Invest NI assistance, despite the fact that the organisation has  acres of land holdings in the area mdash the biggest in the province.The MP added: ldquoI will be meeting with the new Invest NI chief executive in the weeks ahead to impress upon him the the importance of creating a regionally balanced economy and developing a much more ambitious vision for creating and supporting economic opportunities in South Down.Ms Rogan said the fact that no one from Invest NI had met with potential investors in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area for such a long time was ldquounacceptable, suggesting that this was ldquoreminiscent of decades of discrimination and neglect of the area by British and unionist governments.Ms Rogan confirmed that she has written to the economy minister to ask why Invest NI hosted no potential investors in South Down for such a long period and asked what she intends to do to address the ldquoserious imbalance compared to all other constituencies.A spokeswoman for Invest NI said the organisation and Northern Irelandrsquos  councils were actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of the province.She said that investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.ldquoOver the past years, we have offered over poundm of support to businesses across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area, including  externally owned companies.

Ryan Wilson ed at inside centre and Conor Rankin came in on the wing with Ross Adair at full back.Up front, Bradley Luney continued in the number seven jersey with Conall Boomer on the bench as his recovery from a knee ligament injury continues to be managed.The match itself was a tight affair, dictated by a dficult, swirling wind and Ballynahinch did superbly well to overcome the concession of a try to Lansdowne flyer Peter Sullivan and the sin-binning of Luney, to lead - at half-time thanks to two well-taken penalties from Hutley.The defence in particular was vastly improved and this continued in the second half as the game turned into a real dogfight with defence on top.Skipper John Donnan and his fellow lock Jack Regan led the way with outstanding work in defence and huge work rate around the park with Chris Gibson having an impressive stint off the bench at scrum-half, but a penalty at a ruck around half way allowed Lansdowne to work themselves into an excellent field position as the game reached its conclusion and they manufactured the winning score.The losing bonus point kept the locals well in touch with their fellow strugglers, Trinity and University College Cork as both lost at home.Terenurersquos victory at the Mardyke looks to have pulled them clear of any relegation issues and although Ballynahinch are bottom of the table on  points, they remain just one behind UCC and three behind Trinity.The next two games against high flying Garryowen and UCD will be a huge challenge before a blockbuster home game against UCC on March .

It is not yet clear at what point new lts will be installed at the Cloonagh Road facility.Local drivers who were due to have their vehicles tested have been granted a four-month extension of their existing certicate and are expected to be informed of their new test dates over the coming weeks.Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has confirmed that following the discovery of faults with lts in MoT centres in late January, her priority was the safety of DVA staff and customers.She said that since news of the faulty vehicle lts emerged, she acted quickly to minimise inconvenience to the public and allow drivers to tax their vehicles and continue to drive.Ms Mallon said that she has been examining all of the options to resume normal business as quickly and safely as possible, including the commissioning of two independent reviews to provide her with expert advice on the condition of the existing lts, the events that led to the situation and how it can be avoided in future.ldquoI have now been given the first report from the independent engineering expertrsquos assessment on the condition of the existing lts, she confirmed.ldquoIt has recommended that all lts with faults identied should be replaced, not repaired. The second audit investigation report has not been completed, however, it has highlighted that there are no issues with the purchasing of this equipment from the existing supplier.The infrastructure minister said she has decided to replace all  lts across MoT centres at a cost of pound.m.She continued: ldquoIt is clear that an inadequate inspection regime and metal fatigue led to this situation. I have therefore instructed my officials to put in place an improved equipment replacement cycle and regular robust inspection and maintenance, with an additional layer of independent inspection built into the new contract.ldquoUntil the lts are operational, the advice to customers remains the same. All vehicles will have the necessary cover to allow them to remain on the road, either through a temporary exemption certicate or a priority appointment.Ms Mallon said that road safety is a priority for her and she reminded drivers that they also have a responsibility to ensure their vehicles are roadworthy at all times.The minister continued: ldquoThe priority vehicle contact line, for owners of four year old vehicles, taxis and car dealerships, will continue to operate to make it easier for these vehicle owners to contact DVA for an urgent appointment.ldquoTemporary exemption certicates will continue to be issued to all cancelled customers, enabling the public to continue to use their cars and all customers who have been cancelled will receive a full refund of their booking fee.The infrastructure minister said that while the steps she has taken willtest centres to full capacity safely and swtly, the situation has brought to light the need to improve the MoT system and centres and this is something she will be considering in the months ahead.Ms Mallon added: ldquoI will continue to keep this matter under review and as the position changes and the new lts become operational I will ensure that the public are fully informed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th March 2020 MP.jpg","title":"MP presses roads minister to give assurance on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been urged to provide a public assurance that delivery of the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for the Department for Infrastructure.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard and comes just weeks after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to seek a meeting with the minister to make the case for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed poundm scheme.The multi-million pound project has been shovel ready for some time, with local politicians hoping that the government department will allocate funding for the near two-mile scheme which is expected to take in excess of  months to complete.The bypass is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district and roads officials have insisted that the bypass will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the by-pass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard mdash who formally signed-off the proposal to start work on the by-pass in December  when he was infrastructure minister mdash has written to the new minister.He said it has been six weeks since Ms Mallon took the reins at the government department, claiming Ballynahinch businesses and commuters were beginning to question the ldquolack of public commentary on the bypass issue.The MP continued: ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready, yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead.ldquoI have once again asked the Department to provide an update on this long overdue scheme. Hopefully, the minister will take this opportunity to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department,and it is not being relegated for an alternative project where.Work on a major ground condition survey along the route of the by-pass has been completed, as has an archaeological investigation. Progression to the construction stage remains subject to clearing statutory procedures and securing finance.Roads officials have previously confirmed that given the scale of the multi-million pound scheme, the Department of Infrastructure is required to carry out archaeological and geotechnical investigations along the route of the by-pass.In addition, they say the ious surveys and other work is being completed in advance to ensure that key pieces of the development jigsaw are in place when the bid for funding is made.A spokeswoman for the department said the minister recognised that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch.ldquoUnfortunately, the minister has inherited severe and challenging budget constraints. However, recognising the importance of the Ballynahinch bypass and many others schemes within her Department, the minister is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives across Northern Ireland, she said.ldquoThe minister is currently assessing the pressures across her department reflecting her priorities, the commitments in the New Decade: New Approach document and the budget made available for the period ahead.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Russian military had no immediate comment on the claim, but it has staunchly denied similar previous claims insisting it hasnrsquot targeted residential areas.The fighting in Idlib comes as the most severe test to Russia-Turkey ties since the crisis triggered by Turkeyrsquos downing of a Russian warplane near the Syrian border in November .Russia responded with an array of sweeping economic sanctions, cutting the flow of its tourists to Turkey and banning most Turkish exports, a punishment that eventually forced Turkey to back off and offer apologies.Turkey cannot afford a replay of that costly crisis, far less a military conflict with a nuclear power, but it has a strong position to bargain with.Moscow needs Ankara as a partner in a Syrian settlement and Russiarsquos supply routes for its forces in Syria lie through the Turkish Straits.Moscow also hopes to use Ankara in its standoff with the West.Last year, Turkey became the first Nato country to take delivery of sophisticated Russian air defence missile systems, angering the United States.Turkey has put its deployment on hold amid the crisis in Idlib.The talks in Moscow will mark the th encounter in just over a year between Mr Putin and Mr Erdogan, who call each other ldquodear friend and have polished a fine art of bargaining. vw,vw,px, px\"Civilians flee from Idlib toward the north to find safety inside Syria Last October, they reached an agreement to deploy their forces across Syriarsquos northeastern border to fill the void left by President Donald Trumprsquos abrupt withdrawal of US forces.Prior to that they had negotiated a series of accords that saw opposition fighters from ious areas in Syria move into Idlib and in  carved out a de-escalation zone in Idlib.They blamed one another for the collapse of the Idlib deal, with Moscow holding Ankara responsible for letting al Qaida linked militants launch attacks from the area and Turkey accusing Moscow of failing to rein in Mr Assad.A possible compromise on Idlib could see Mr Assad retain control over the key M highway, which his forces claimed in the latest offensive.The road that spans Syria linking Damascus with Aleppo, the countryrsquos commercial capital, is essential for Mr Assad to consolidate his rule.In a sign that the Kremlin firmly intends to secure control of the M, earlier this week Russian military police have deployed to a strategic town of Saraqeb sitting on the road to ward off any Turkish attempt to retake it.In , Mr Putin could accept the presence of Turkey-backed militants in the areas alongside the border and put brakes for now on Mr Assadrsquos attempts to claim full control over Idlib..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Vladimir Putin and Turkish president meet in bid to forge Syria agreement article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid.

It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
