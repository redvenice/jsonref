Sorry (Picture: Reuters)Lidl is every bargain hunter’s best friend.But it looks like it’s just found a new BFF – the stoner.The German supermarket has unveiled a new line of locally grown cannabis for their customers over in Switzerland.It’s being offered up as an alternative to rolling tobacco, and for 18 Swiss francs (£13.20), you can grab a 1.5g box made from hemp plants grown indoors.For 19.99 Swiss francs, you can buy a 3g box, but it will be made from flowers grown in greenhouses, the  reports.Lidl’s range of products, from local Swiss supplier The Botanicals, are not designed to give a strong ‘high’, but to make people feel relaxed.Per cigarette, the cost is roughly double that of tobacco roll-ups.Instead of being made up of psychoactive THC, the product is high on cannabidiol (CBD).‘The legally cultivable varieties contain only very small amounts of THC and a high proportion of CBD,’ Lidl said."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10218615.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"meghan markle take british citizenship test prince harry wedding take quiz see fare","story":"Meghan Markle will have to take a British citizenship test (Picture: Getty – PA)Meghan Markle will be taking a Life In the UK British citizenship test following her marriage to Prince Harry.Harry and American former actress Meghan revealed their engagement on 27 November last year and it was confirmed by Harry’s communications secretary that she would be applying for citizenship.‘I can also say she intends to become a UK citizen and will go through the process of that, which some of you may know takes a number of years,’ he said at the time.In order to become a British citizen, applicants must have lived in the United Kingdom for three years, have a sound mind, have good knowledge of the English language and be able to pass the Life In The UK test, which costs £50.The questions are based on the Life In The United Kingdom: A Guide For New Residents handbook, covering 3,000 facts about life in the UK – from how big the Lake District is to what year England won the World Cup.Meghan has lived in the UK since November last year when she moved into Kensington Palace’s Nottingham Cottage with Harry.It’s likely Meghan hasn’t had too much time to brush up on her reading though, what with all of that wedding planning she’s been doing.See how you would fare with our sample test below – you’ll need to score nine out of 12 to hit the standard pass rate:MORE: Meghan Markle’s half-brother claims their dad is not invited to royal wedding in shockingly scathing letterMORE: Prince Harry to snub tradition of royal men not wearing rings at Meghan Markle wedding"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sei_10086464.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"statue giant erection receives stiff opposition locals","story":"The sculpture is going to be a fountain in which water will be shot into the mouth (Picture: CEN)Not everybody in Antwerp is happy with their latest art installation in a local park.A statue has been (ahem) erected that has caused a bit of a stir and has been met with (ahem again) stiff opposition.The statue, called (another ahem) the Arc de Triomphe features a man in the crab position with a fully erect penis.Do not scroll any further if you do not wish to see the appendage.City bosses have been getting a hard time over the sculpture which is going to be turned into a fountain with water projecting from the tip of the penis into the sculpture’s mouth.The bizarre piece of art, which has plasticine genitals, has been erected in the park of the Middelheim Museum in the Belgian city of Antwerp.The art installation has received stiff opposition but hardened officials want to keep it in place (Picture: CEN)Museum director Sara Weyns said: ‘I determine that nude bodies can indeed touch visitors.‘We do have quite a lot of nude bodies in our collection, but those are often women’s bodies.

Those aren’t exactly traditional options.But some parents are thinking really out of the box. Parenting website Kidspot has shared a list of new, unusual names that have been chosen in 2018.Within the list are spelling twists on old school names, like Yza-Bella and Aeric, combinations of names, such as Dwarren (Darren and Warren), and names seemingly plucked out of thin air.

I shout it from rooftops. I did it for a week at work for content reasons.But the truth is that in the personal bit of my life, I don’t actually masturbate.I’ve masturbated before, obviously. That in-office session I mentioned, of course. I got quite into it when I was a teenager learning about my body and figuring out my sexuality.But as I moved past 17, the urge to masturbate petered out.Gone were the days of makeshift vibrators and hiding under my duvet with Avril Lavigne playing in the background so my parents wouldn’t hear a soft buzz. Suddenly masturbation wasn’t on my radar.Yes, that’s probably in part due to actually starting to have sex with other people.Once I dated people and realised that they could tick sex off the list, masturbation didn’t have the same urgency.But it wasn’t as simple as ‘if I’m horny, I’ll just text someone for sex’.When I my university relationship turned long-distance, the urge to masturbate didn’t rush back with renewed force. It just didn’t occur to me. I was busy doing things writing essays, spending time with friends, working out how I could make a giant pack of pasta last for the next three months.(Picture: Ella Byworth for )In my downtime I’d watch TV or waste time on the internet – it’s not that I was rejecting masturbation, but that it didn’t even spring to mind as an option.Occasionally my hand would wander south, but only prompted by instruction from the person I was seeing at the time. I’d never touch myself based purely on my own volition. It didn’t really count as masturbation, just sex 4,000 miles apart.When I was single, things stayed the same.It was (and still is) pretty rare for me to randomly be overcome with lust without any prompting. I’ve worked out that my arousal depends very much on another person. I’m not getting off on specific movements, but on the interaction – the bit where someone else decides what they’re going to do, the bit where you feel yourself reacting to their touch, the bit where they react to yours.I gave masturbating a go on my own, conscious of its benefits and committed to feeling the empowerment of giving myself an orgasm.But the experience fell flat. I felt like I didn’t know what I was doing. It was boring.I tried porn. I felt nothing.I tried fantasising, but found myself getting more into plot devices than arousal.30 minutes would go by with nothing to write home about and I’d give up, questioning why I’d wasted my time fiddling with my bits when I just wasn’t feeling it.I tried a few different times, but the same thing happened. It didn’t feel bad, but the pleasure I was getting from it paled in comparison from the joy of watching an episode of the Mindy Project or the relaxation I gained from spending the afternoon baking.Now, as a semi-proper adult, I just don’t bother.I can’t be bothered. I don’t have the time or the urge.(Picture: Ella Byworth for )But the thing is, I feel some shame in admitting that. I feel like being a non-masturbator would make me seem unempowered, sexually inept, or a prude – none of which I am.I’d spent my teens arguing back against the rumours that masturbating was ‘dirty’ or made you a lesbian (no, I don’t get that either), shouting the lessons I’d learned from Cosmo about how it’s brilliant to be able to give yourself sexual pleasure and learn what you like.Now I’ll awkwardly nod along to conversations about wanking, feeling backwards for not having a nightly sesh.I’ve realised that just as there should be no shame in masturbating, there should be no shame in not masturbating, either.I know myself now. I know that my arousal and my pleasure is based in interactions with another person, and that trying to get off totally solo isn’t going to work for me.I can masturbate in front of the person I’m having sex with. That’s great, so clearly I know what I’m doing. But without another person there to react and engage, touching myself does f*** all.I’m busy. I’m tired. My sex drive is low enough as it is without me scrapping sex opportunities for my partner by attempting to deal with horniness on my own.I’ve learned that in terms of pleasure, the non-sexual kind is the one I’m best at giving myself. If I’m stressed, I can go for a run, or talk about stuff, or write it down. If I’m bored, I’ll find something to do.If on the very rare occasion I am wildly turned on, it’s better for me to give my partner a call than try to sort things out on my own, as I’ll only end up frustrated that it’s not doing the trick, or have to dedicate at least an hour to actually get any benefits.Masturbation is a wonderful thing, but if it’s not for you, that’s perfectly alright. It doesn’t mean you’re repressed or entirely un-sexual or incapable of self-care.Sexual empowerment is about finding out what gets you off and being comfortable with it, not pushing yourself to do something because you think you ‘should’. That might be an elaborate self-stroking schedule with candles and background music, or it might be only being interested in physical sex with another person. That’s totally fine.Wank onwards, or don’t, or keep that path open.I’ve learned I can be a loud, proud supporter of masturbation while not personally being wild on it myself.MORE: Men who masturbate often have better sex livesMORE: What it’s like to work at a foot fetish partyMORE: Straight women explain what sex feels like when you have a vagina"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_7927051.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"woman 33 years younger partner shares make age gap relationships work","story":"Rahab and Joe (Picture: RAHAB KIMANI  CATERS NEWS)The general rule for age gaps in relationships goes ‘your age, ided by two, plus seven’.Anything younger than that is deemed ‘unacceptable’ by society.This arbitrary formula would mean Rahab Kimani and her partner Joe Singiser were way out of range to date.That’s because Joe is 54 and Rahab is 21. The pair live in Barnaget, New Jersey.We spoke to Rahab about her relationship with Joe, and how they make it work.(Picture: RAHAB KIMANI  CATERS NEWS)Rahab and Joe met while they were both working as carers at a nursing home, and have now been together for over a year. Rahab told :‘We saw each other all the time and gave each looks but we never really had a full conversation by ourselves. I was getting ready to move to Boston with my sister and someone told me to ask him for big boxes, so I went to his office and asked him…‘We flirted back-and-forth and he asked me if I wanted to go out for dinner.’From there, they became a couple (with Rahab rethinking her decision to move), but have had to deal with judgement from other people.Rahab says, ‘My family was mad, disappointed, disgusted. I remember my sister didn’t even want to talk to me, my dad couldn’t even look at me, and my mom was mad but she was there for me.‘I don’t really have a lot of friends but the friends that I had at the nursing home they felt the same way as my family. Most of my friends are my cousins and I thought my cousins would be there for me and defend me when the rest of the family were saying disgusting and horrible things about me, but until today they still don’t defend me.She turned to Joe for solace, saying, ‘When a situation like this happens, what I do is I just distance myself and I go home and I cry to Joe. I don’t know exactly what they’re trying to do, but all they’re doing is just bringing me and Joe even closer.’In age-gap relationships, because the difference is right there for everyone to see instantly, it can illicit a reaction from people.It’s not always the healthiest thing to retreat into yourselves in situations like this, but usually the longer you’re together, the less this reaction will persist.People will eventually come round to you as a couple, rather than simply looking at the difference in age. In the meantime, all you can do is ‘do you’.Rahab also says that getting looks from family and strangers can hurt, although she tells us, ‘lately we haven’t been getting any looks whatsoever – or maybe I don’t notice it anymore.’Stopping yourself from caring about any weird looks or comments certainly isn’t the easiest thing in the world, but Rahab tells us it’s what you need to do to stay sane.Behind closed doors, Rahab says they have little niggles, but nothing major. She hates the way he snores at night and he hates the way she grinds her teeth in her sleep, and Rahab says: ‘No couple is perfect, especially not us.’One of the things that comes up time and time again in age-gap partnerships is the potential for a power imbalance.For Rahab and Joe this hasn’t been an issue – probably because they were working at the same place when they got together. However, when the older counterpart makes significantly more money or is in a higher position professionally, this can seep into your romantic life.If the older partner is used to getting what they want, particularly around younger subordinates, they may struggle to change their habits at home.It’s also worth noting the reason for them dating someone younger. Sometimes, it’s that you both just click, but in some situations it can be that they (consciously or subconsciously) want to take advantage of your naivete.Percy Pig is getting married so where the f*** is my ring?For Joe and Rahab, the age difference has actually benefited her more, as she feels more secure. She says, ‘The best part of being in a age gap relationship is Joe is very clean, so he picks up after me, does my laundry, cooks dinner every night, and takes real good care of me’.Not having to deal with a young guy who doesn’t know how to work the hoover is a huge plus for some. Rahab also says she enjoys, ‘not having to deal with other girls, not worrying about him texting other girls… Basically no bullsh*t.’Do people become more straightforward and honest as they age? Perhaps it’s always been Joe’s way. However, they’re still going strong after a year, so they’re certainly doing something right.MORE: Paul Hollywood’s ex-wife shares ‘easy tart’ recipe as Paul’s 22-year-old lover defends age gap"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/21/4BBDB2EF00000578-5679959-image-m-86_1525207260912.jpg","title":"The Queen flies Kensington Palace helicopter meet Prince Louis","story":"    The Queen emerges from a helicopter after flying the short journey to Kensington Palace to meet Prince Louis  The Queen had flown from Windsor  to see her sixth great-grandchild, Prince Louis, for the first time yesterday          The Queen, carrying her Launer handbag, climbed out of the helicopter at Kensington Palace and walked across the grass      Look radiant in a red dress like the Duchess in Jenny PackhamShop the ready-to-wear line here at NET-A-PORTERThe newest member of the Royal family has finally arrived, and of course all eyes are on the doors of the Lindo Wing to get a glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s baby boy.

The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that. For decades, Noonan was suspected of being a predatory sex offender by the police, the public, fellow villains and even members of his own family.But he did not have any criminal convictions for a sex offence to confirm the rumours - until now.The defendant, from Moston, Manchester, was described as a \u0027persistent sexual offender\u0027 on the first day of his trial, as he pleaded not guilty to all charges including eight counts of indecent assault and attempted rape.  Extraordinary moment British man \u0027walked into a Colorado art...Estate agent, 27, caught doing 72mph in 40mph zone in her...Share this articleThe court heard he groomed and molested boys after plying them with drink.In his opening statement, prosecutor Darren Preston told Manchester Crown Court: \u0027It is the prosecution case that over many years, the defendant engaged and was acting as a persistent sexual predator.  He is already serving an 11-year sentence for arson, blackmail and perverting the course of justice, passed in 2015. The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that\u0027He surrounded himself with young teenage boys, usually vulnerable boys, has groomed them by plying them with alcohol, favours and sometimes threats, and has routinely sexually abused them.\u0027He also traded on what he perceived was his notoriety and reputation in the local area.\u0027 His first victim was aged just 10 when Noonan, who was six years older, took him from a care home and indecently assaulted him twice, ordering the boy not to tell anyone.The second victim said he was 16 or 17 when he first met Noonan outside a pizzeria. He told how Noonan threatened him, accusing him of having called him \u0027gay\u0027, before he was beaten by a gang of teens with hockey sticks. He then indecently assaulted the boy on a few occasions, once in a disused shop.A third victim said he was in his early teens in the 2000s when he met Noonan, who molested him on 20 or more occasions. He described how he would spend time driving around with Noonan and other young lads. He would be taken to parties where there was drink and drugs. Noonan would ply them with drink, but not get drunk himself. His victim described being \u0027brainwashed\u0027 into thinking the abuse was normal.The fourth victim was aged in his mid-teens when he met Noonan in the 2000s, agreeing to renovate a pub for him. This victim was said to be completely under Noonan\u0027s spell.At the conclusion of his trial at Manchester Crown Court, Noonan was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault, one of attempted rape, two of inciting a child into sexual activity, one of sexual assault and one of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child.  One of 14 siblings, Noonan became the spokesman for the family following death of his brother Damian, aged 37, in a motorbike accident in the Dominican Republic in 2004, followed by the murder of his brother Dessie in 2005.Dessie and Damian had worked on the door of the Hacienda in the 1980s and were then said to control the supply of drugs at the nightclub.When they died, Dominic Noonan became the boss, or at least he gave the appearance of being the head of the family.A cunning, intelligent inidual, he admitted to being \u0027thoroughly dishonest\u0027 during his trial. He has trumpeted that he is anti-racist and has made much of being able to speak Urdu although, actually, he only knows a few phrases. Over the years, Greater Manchester Police have found little difficulty in obtaining evidence to lock him up for everything from possessing a gun to arson and blackmail.He has spent most of his adult life behind bars. But proving he was a predatory sex offender was another matter. In 2010, a rape charge was dropped. Shortly after he was released from a long prison sentence on licence, he was accused of raping a woman in a hotel room after celebrating his birthday but prosecutors dropped the case.  In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prisonIn 2013, he was cleared of child rape charges after the court heard his accuser had a history of making false complaints. He had been accused of molesting the boy of 15 in a flat in Bloom Street in Manchester city centre.In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prison.Police, paramedics and firefighters had to rescue him in a £30,000 operation as more than 1,000 people gathered to watch in the city centre. Officers said his \u0027outrageous\u0027 actions endangered the lives of tourists - including a petrified three-year-old boy - who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in Piccadilly Gardens for two hours.The drama, which began after Noonan was told he had breached his licence conditions, started when he yelled: \u0027I am going to jump.\u0027 in 2016, he was found not guilty of engaging in a sex act in front of a minor, although he was convicted of perverting the course of justice by offering £5,000 to the boy\u0027s family to get the charge dropped. The prosecution alleged that the boy covered his face with a poster as a \u0027vulnerable\u0027 adult man was intimidated into performing a sex act on Noonan in a bedroom, he was also convicted of arson and blackmail connected to a row over an ice cream van, and jailed for eleven years.So, while police have tried many times, it is only now that Noonan has been brought to justice for sex offences."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/11/4BCD4F4F00000578-0-image-a-3_1525343242711.jpg","title":"Thousand year old castle featured Doctor sale 1m","story":"    The historic Welsh castle near Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan dates back nearly a thousand years and starred in an action packed episode of the sci-fi drama. Doctor Who fans can now buy it for £1million - less than the price of a London flat          The country estate includes the castle ruins and mansion house.

In exchange, Iran regained access to the global banking system and could sell its oil again on the world market.Airplane manufacturers, carmakers and others have rushed into Iran after the accord. However, some Western firms have grown increasingly reluctant to enter the market, in part over Trump\u0027s constant criticism on the campaign trail and from the White House on the deal.While directly criticising the U.S. and Europe, Zarif did appear to leave some wiggle room for possible negotiations, however.

Analysts and family members of dual nationals and others detained in Iran say hard-liners in the Islamic Republic\u0027s security agencies use the prisoners as bargaining chips in negotiations with the West.A U.N. panel in September described \u0027an emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals\u0027 in Iran, which Tehran denied.The video comes amid intense lobbying on Trump from all sides. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself earlier this week gave an English-language presentation on what he called a \u0027half ton\u0027 of Iranian nuclear documents illicitly seized by Israeli intelligence.Netanyahu said the documents provided evidence that Iran attempted to develop a nuclear bomb in the 2000s. The United Nations\u0027 atomic watchdog previously reported such efforts and said it has \u0027no credible indications of activities in Iran relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device after 2009.\u0027Zarif himself dismissed Netanyahu\u0027s presentation as \u0027a rehash of old allegations\u0027 and called the prime minister \u0027the boy who can\u0027t stop crying wolf.\u0027In the video, Zarif also appears to troll Trump as well by making a real-estate analogy to the former developer.\u0027When you buy a house and move your family in it or demolish it to build a skyscraper, you cannot come back two years later and renegotiate the price,\u0027 he says.            President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from the nuclear agreement by May 12 if it is not renegotiated and changed"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/15/4BCFD95500000578-5687053-image-a-13_1525356428006.jpg","title":"Lexus motorist parks middle busy road collect dry cleaning","story":"    The driver of the Lexus, which had a private plate stops in the middle of the street outside Paddington Station in central London          The man is shown shaking his finger at workmen as he pulls up on the street which has one lane blocked by roadworksOvertaking driver loses control and smashes into the side of...Drunk teacher’s own dashcam captures her crashing into the...Share this articleBut the man is shown shaking his finger around at them as he he throws his dry cleaning in the boot.The other man, who appeared from the dry cleaning shop to hand over the clothes, almost has his hand shut in the boot door,He manages to stuff the enormous bag of dry cleaning into his boot while another workman is shown filming the whole incident unfold.The man then speeds off in his car while traffic is shown piling up in the opposite lane.The clip was filmed by Kev Grosvenor who shared it on Facebook yesterday.

The fund will pay their wages.As part of his offering, he will also announce proposals to drop an accountability measure that names and shames ‘coasting’ schools. It has been hated by teachers since it was introduced three years ago as the Government had originally said those identified would be forced to become academies.The new sabbaticals for teachers will act as a reward for those with ten or more years of experience and will enable them to work on projects that complement their work in the classroom. Participants will be expected to show how their work will benefit their pupils when they return to school.It follows warnings about a teacher shortage caused by rising pupil numbers and an improving private sector job market. Announcing the move today in a speech to the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers, Mr Hinds will say he is keen to attract more talented people to the profession.‘All of us have a shared goal of making sure teaching remains an attractive, fulfilling profession,’ he will say.Essex teacher who kicked a female pupil and branded her...The pupils who can\u0027t talk properly: Education secretary vows...British schools linked to an Abu Hamza \u0027terror academy\u0027 are...Ex-integration tsar warns a £50million plan to end ided...Share this article‘We will take an unflinching look at the things that discourage people from going into teaching or make them consider leaving … and we will also look at how we support teachers to get better at what they do and hone their experience and career progression.’While there are currently a record number of teachers working in schools, the increase in staff has not kept pace with the explosion of the pupil population following a period of sustained migration.The measures proposed by Mr Hinds are aimed at encouraging more people into the profession to plug the shortfall. Other offerings include introducing ‘flexible working practices’ and extending on-the-job training for new teachers.And in an olive branch to the profession, the Education Secretary will also say he intends to drop the ‘coasting schools’ accountability measure.Currently, school exam results are judged on two measures – a minimum ‘below the floor’ standard and a ‘coasting’ standard aimed at exposing those schools that are not performing as well as expected even if they meet minimum requirements.          The move intends to stop burn out and help teachers advance in their careersTeachers branded the measure complicated and unfair. Mr Hinds will now revert to one minimum standard, with a consultation on how that should be set, and no threat of the measure being used to force schools to become academies.Only schools deemed failing by Ofsted will now be in line for conversion into academies.Stressing the need for accountability, Mr Hinds will say today: ‘I intend to replace the current confusing system of having both “below the floor” and “coasting” standards for performance.‘I have a clear message to schools and their leaders: I trust you to get on with the job.’Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, welcomed the proposals. ‘Teaching is such a rewarding profession, so it’s disheartening to see teachers leaving due to the pressure of workload and high stakes accountability. A fund for sabbaticals is exactly what we’re asking for.‘Removing the coasting and floor standards will do much to address the confusion felt by many school leaders.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/23/4BD398AB00000578-0-image-m-26_1525387545389.jpg","title":"Juncker calls Brits working EU given Belgian citizenship not lose jobs post Brexit","story":"Labour lose control of bellwether Nuneaton council as the...Trump COULD be given honour of speech at Parliament when he...Brexiteers fear May could try to IGNORE \u0027War Cabinet\u0027...Local election chaos as voters are turned away from polling...Share this articleA mass movement of UK officials becoming Belgian after Brexit could also provoke controversy because it would mean that they would effectively take up a significant part of Belgium’s share of EU institutional positions.The move emerged after former Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday dismissed Belgium as a ‘non-nation’ and claimed the EU could only rely on support from those who ‘are on the EU payroll’.He said: ‘Nobody ever dares tell the truth about Belgium: Belgium is not a nation.

Kim\u0027s meeting with Xi was his first foreign visit since he took power in 2011.  Today\u0027s meeting between Kim and Wang was held at the headquarters of Workers\u0027 Party of Korea, according to China\u0027s state newspaper People\u0027s Daily.China\u0027s president Xi extended greetings to Kim through Wang, said People\u0027s Daily.     China\u0027s president Xi (right) met Kim (left) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in March          ​​​​China\u0027s foreign minister, Wang Yi (left), arrived in North Korea\u0027s capital on Wednesday. He met the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho (right) in Pyongyang on May 2          China\u0027s foreign minister Wang Yi (centre left) attends a meeting with North Korea\u0027s foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho (centre right) at the Mansudae Assembly Hall in Pyongyang on May 2According to People\u0027s Daily, which is run by the Communist Party of China, Wang\u0027s purpose of visiting North Korea is to deal with the matters which have been agreed upon between Kim and Xi during their previous meeting.Wang said during the meeting that Kim and Xi\u0027s meeting in Beijing had opened a new chapter for the China-North Korea relation and would guide the two countries into a new stage of mutual development. The Chinese foreign minister congratulated the success of the historic summit between Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week. Kim and Moon signed a declaration that \u0027there will be no more war on the Korean Peninsula\u0027 on Friday after meeting at the heavily fortified demilitarised zone between their countries. Wang praised that North Korea had been considering the situation carefully and making decisive tactics in order to give a positive spin on the Korean Peninsula.  On the other hand, Kim requested Wang to extend his greetings to Xi, said People\u0027s Daily. The North Korean leader reportedly called the relation between Pyongyang and Beijing \u0027extremely precious\u0027 and vowed to reinforce and develop the \u0027friendly cooperation\u0027 between the two nations.   Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (center) is welcomed by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Ri Kil Song (right) on his arrival at Pyongyang Airport, North Korea, on Wednesday  Beijing is trying to ensure a larger role  in the new round of nuclear diplomacy with PyongyangWang Yi\u0027s visit came days after Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work toward the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the Korean Peninsula, though they did not mention specific plans or timetables.They also agreed to work toward formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War and push for three-way talks with Washington or four-way talks that also include Beijing to do so. The Koreas can\u0027t officially end the war themselves because South Korea wasn\u0027t a direct signatory to the armistice that stopped the fighting but left the peninsula technically in a state of war.More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation - including what, when and how it would occur - are expected between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who could meet in May or June. The North\u0027s state-media have not yet commented on Wang\u0027s arrival in Pyongyang.Wang is likely to use his visit to further ensure that Beijing would not be sidelined in the high-stakes discussions surrounding the North. Some South Korean analysts believe Wang would specifically seek Kim\u0027s commitment that the process on formally ending the war would include China.    Kim Jong-un (left) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in raise their hands after signing a joint statement at the border village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarised Zone on April 27          Kim and Moon shake hands across the military demarcation line prior to Kim\u0027s crossing into the South for talks at the Peace House of the truce village of Panmunjom on April 27The meeting between Kim and Moon at the border truce village of Panmunjom on Friday came a month after Kim made a surprise visit to Beijing and met with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Kim\u0027s Beijing visit was widely seen as a move to strengthen his leverage ahead of his talks with Trump by re-introducing China as a major player in the global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff.Analysts say Kim would have asked China, North Korea\u0027s only major ally and main economic lifeline, to soften its enforcement of sanctions aimed at the North. Kim also may have sought Chinese commitments to strongly oppose any military measure the United States might take should his talks with Trump fall apart and the North starts testing missiles again.While the Kim-Trump talks is shaping up to be crucial, there\u0027s still widespread doubt whether Kim will ever agree to entirely abandon his nuclear weapons when he apparently sees them as providing his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.Seoul has said Kim expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \u0027denuclearization\u0027 that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.Kim\u0027s move to re-insert China as a major player in the process has been seen as a sign that the North\u0027s traditional stance essentially remains. Beijing has been calling for a \u0027dual suspension\u0027 - of the North\u0027s nuclear and missile activities and of the large-scale military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/19/4BD0FF1100000578-5683107-image-a-55_1525373658091.jpg","title":"Bank Holiday Monday set hottest 20 years temperatures soaring 77F","story":"    The holiday weekend starts early in sunny Weymouth (pictured) where visitors have enjoyed warm sunshine all day          Cyclists in the 2018 Asda Women\u0027s Tour de Yorkshire were treated to fields full of bright flowers as they left Beverley today          Rows of cyclists could be seen travelling alongside the colourful greenery as they travelled through the Yorkshire town          The trees are in bloom in the Kew Gardens today as a woman (pictured) walks through the Rhododendron dell          Visitors to the sandy beach in Weymouth, Dorset, started the weekend early by enjoying the heat on offer throughout the day          This was the scene today as boats lined the River Thames in Goring, Oxfordshire, and owners relished in the heat          Members of the public enjoy an array of colourful plants at Kilver Court Gardens near Shepton Mallet, Somerset, as the attraction basks in glorious springtime sunshine  A family (pictured) soak up the sun as they take a walk through the bluebells found at Kew Gardens in, Kew, London          A couple holds hands as they look out on the people relishing the heat on the beach in Weymouth, DorsetMet Office deputy chief meteorologist Chris Bulmer said: \u0027We can\u0027t promise wall to wall sunshine for everyone this Bank Holiday weekend.

The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that. For decades, Noonan was suspected of being a predatory sex offender by the police, the public, fellow villains and even members of his own family.But he did not have any criminal convictions for a sex offence to confirm the rumours - until now.The defendant, from Moston, Manchester, was described as a \u0027persistent sexual offender\u0027 on the first day of his trial, as he pleaded not guilty to all charges including eight counts of indecent assault and attempted rape.  Extraordinary moment British man \u0027walked into a Colorado art...Estate agent, 27, caught doing 72mph in 40mph zone in her...Share this articleThe court heard he groomed and molested boys after plying them with drink.In his opening statement, prosecutor Darren Preston told Manchester Crown Court: \u0027It is the prosecution case that over many years, the defendant engaged and was acting as a persistent sexual predator.  He is already serving an 11-year sentence for arson, blackmail and perverting the course of justice, passed in 2015. The latest sentence will start after he has finished serving that\u0027He surrounded himself with young teenage boys, usually vulnerable boys, has groomed them by plying them with alcohol, favours and sometimes threats, and has routinely sexually abused them.\u0027He also traded on what he perceived was his notoriety and reputation in the local area.\u0027 His first victim was aged just 10 when Noonan, who was six years older, took him from a care home and indecently assaulted him twice, ordering the boy not to tell anyone.The second victim said he was 16 or 17 when he first met Noonan outside a pizzeria. He told how Noonan threatened him, accusing him of having called him \u0027gay\u0027, before he was beaten by a gang of teens with hockey sticks. He then indecently assaulted the boy on a few occasions, once in a disused shop.A third victim said he was in his early teens in the 2000s when he met Noonan, who molested him on 20 or more occasions. He described how he would spend time driving around with Noonan and other young lads. He would be taken to parties where there was drink and drugs. Noonan would ply them with drink, but not get drunk himself. His victim described being \u0027brainwashed\u0027 into thinking the abuse was normal.The fourth victim was aged in his mid-teens when he met Noonan in the 2000s, agreeing to renovate a pub for him. This victim was said to be completely under Noonan\u0027s spell.At the conclusion of his trial at Manchester Crown Court, Noonan was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault, one of attempted rape, two of inciting a child into sexual activity, one of sexual assault and one of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child.  One of 14 siblings, Noonan became the spokesman for the family following death of his brother Damian, aged 37, in a motorbike accident in the Dominican Republic in 2004, followed by the murder of his brother Dessie in 2005.Dessie and Damian had worked on the door of the Hacienda in the 1980s and were then said to control the supply of drugs at the nightclub.When they died, Dominic Noonan became the boss, or at least he gave the appearance of being the head of the family.A cunning, intelligent inidual, he admitted to being \u0027thoroughly dishonest\u0027 during his trial. He has trumpeted that he is anti-racist and has made much of being able to speak Urdu although, actually, he only knows a few phrases. Over the years, Greater Manchester Police have found little difficulty in obtaining evidence to lock him up for everything from possessing a gun to arson and blackmail.He has spent most of his adult life behind bars. But proving he was a predatory sex offender was another matter. In 2010, a rape charge was dropped. Shortly after he was released from a long prison sentence on licence, he was accused of raping a woman in a hotel room after celebrating his birthday but prosecutors dropped the case.  In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prisonIn 2013, he was cleared of child rape charges after the court heard his accuser had a history of making false complaints. He had been accused of molesting the boy of 15 in a flat in Bloom Street in Manchester city centre.In 2014 Noonan, jailed for nine-and-a-half years for keeping a revolver under his car bonnet, scaled Manchester\u0027s Big Wheel to protest against plans to recall him to prison.Police, paramedics and firefighters had to rescue him in a £30,000 operation as more than 1,000 people gathered to watch in the city centre. Officers said his \u0027outrageous\u0027 actions endangered the lives of tourists - including a petrified three-year-old boy - who were stranded aboard the Ferris wheel in Piccadilly Gardens for two hours.The drama, which began after Noonan was told he had breached his licence conditions, started when he yelled: \u0027I am going to jump.\u0027 in 2016, he was found not guilty of engaging in a sex act in front of a minor, although he was convicted of perverting the course of justice by offering £5,000 to the boy\u0027s family to get the charge dropped. The prosecution alleged that the boy covered his face with a poster as a \u0027vulnerable\u0027 adult man was intimidated into performing a sex act on Noonan in a bedroom, he was also convicted of arson and blackmail connected to a row over an ice cream van, and jailed for eleven years.So, while police have tried many times, it is only now that Noonan has been brought to justice for sex offences."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/08/4BCBB2FC00000578-0-image-m-10_1525334205054.jpg","title":"Estate agent caught doing 72mph 40mph zone late work avoids speeding ban","story":"    Nicola Robinson, 27, was clocked doing 72mph in a 40mph zoneAn estate agent caught doing 72mph in a 40mph zone has escaped a road ban after she blamed her driving on being late for work.Nicola Robinson, 27, was clocked at nearly twice the legal limit as she sped through Manchester city centre in her red BMW 116i Sport.The senior sales negotiator for estate agents Jordan Fishwick was travelling from her parents\u0027 luxury barn conversion in Bolton.She had faced a possible disqualification of up to 56 days under rules targeting drivers who travel at 45 per cent above the limit.But at Manchester magistrates court Miss Robinson, who has a clean driving record in ten years of motoring, escaped with six penalty points after telling JPs a ban could mean her losing her job and not being able to pay rent to her parents.She admitted speeding but urged the court not to ban her adding: \u0027I will never do it again - all of my life I have been an estate agent and I don\u0027t know what else I would do.\u0027She also said she had installed a \u0027speed limiter\u0027 in her BMW allowing her to set a maximum speed she can travel at.The incident occurred on July 13 last year when Miss Robinson was flashed by a camera on the A6 Broad Street in Salford as she was driving into work for an afternoon shift. The court heard she was brought before JPs due to the speed she was travelling at.

But where?          King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/00/4BC3567D00000578-0-image-m-54_1525304432194.jpg","title":"Theresa braces devastating losses counting begins local elections","story":"Local election voter ID check - LIVE: People denied right to vote in UK for first time ever due to lack of identification | The IndependentElectoral Commission | How to vote"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/13/4BCE426A00000578-5686121-image-a-36_1525349921134.jpg","title":"Kim Jong meets Chinas foreign minister North Korea","story":"    In this image taken from video footage by China\u0027s CCTV via AP Video, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) meets North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (right) in Pyongyang, North Korea, today          China\u0027s foreign minister Wang Yi (right) congratulated North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (left) on Thursday on his moves to reduce tensions with South Korea, China said  Kim Jong-un, North Korea\u0027s supreme leader, has met Wang Yi, China\u0027s foreign minister in Pyongyang. Beijing is seeking a role in new round of nuclear diplomacy   More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation are expected to happen between Kim and President Donald Trump who could meet in May or JuneButchered rhino carcass and Stone Age tools reveal early...Tourist is spotted carrying a \u0027dolphin\u0027 over his shoulder as...Chinese laureate\u0027s widow willing to \u0027die at home\u0027 in protestChina orders Qantas to toe the Communist Party line or face...Share this articleThe meeting took place about a month after Kim Jong-un had paid a visit to Beijing and met China\u0027s president Xi Jinping.

The North Korean leader reportedly called the relation between Pyongyang and Beijing \u0027extremely precious\u0027 and vowed to reinforce and develop the \u0027friendly cooperation\u0027 between the two nations.   Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (center) is welcomed by North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Ri Kil Song (right) on his arrival at Pyongyang Airport, North Korea, on Wednesday  Beijing is trying to ensure a larger role  in the new round of nuclear diplomacy with PyongyangWang Yi\u0027s visit came days after Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed to work toward the \u0027complete denuclearisation\u0027 of the Korean Peninsula, though they did not mention specific plans or timetables.They also agreed to work toward formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War and push for three-way talks with Washington or four-way talks that also include Beijing to do so. The Koreas can\u0027t officially end the war themselves because South Korea wasn\u0027t a direct signatory to the armistice that stopped the fighting but left the peninsula technically in a state of war.More substantial discussions on the North Korea\u0027s denuclearisation - including what, when and how it would occur - are expected between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, who could meet in May or June. The North\u0027s state-media have not yet commented on Wang\u0027s arrival in Pyongyang.Wang is likely to use his visit to further ensure that Beijing would not be sidelined in the high-stakes discussions surrounding the North. Some South Korean analysts believe Wang would specifically seek Kim\u0027s commitment that the process on formally ending the war would include China.

Kim\u0027s Beijing visit was widely seen as a move to strengthen his leverage ahead of his talks with Trump by re-introducing China as a major player in the global diplomatic push to resolve the nuclear standoff.Analysts say Kim would have asked China, North Korea\u0027s only major ally and main economic lifeline, to soften its enforcement of sanctions aimed at the North. Kim also may have sought Chinese commitments to strongly oppose any military measure the United States might take should his talks with Trump fall apart and the North starts testing missiles again.While the Kim-Trump talks is shaping up to be crucial, there\u0027s still widespread doubt whether Kim will ever agree to entirely abandon his nuclear weapons when he apparently sees them as providing his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.Seoul has said Kim expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \u0027denuclearization\u0027 that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.Kim\u0027s move to re-insert China as a major player in the process has been seen as a sign that the North\u0027s traditional stance essentially remains. Beijing has been calling for a \u0027dual suspension\u0027 - of the North\u0027s nuclear and missile activities and of the large-scale military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66d772089aa5a4156d9d375401832d6c4b08492b/0_0_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e5de90f4834d54cd2b95015a0909ab9","title":"sir paul donates dozens linda mccartney photos v and a museum","story":"Dozens of images taken by singer’s first wife given to museum’s photography centreDozens of intimate family photos and celebrity portraits by Linda McCartney are to form part of a significant new photography centre at the V\u0026ampA Museum. The museum in south-west London is almost doubling the space it devotes to photography to store and display a dramatically enhanced collection, including 270,000 images and objects from the Royal Photographic Society (RPS), and the images from the family of Sir Paul McCartney.The transfer of the RPS artefacts from the Science and Media Museum (SMM) in Bradford has proven bitterly controversial, with one local politician describing it as “an appalling act of cultural vandalism”.Linda McCartney died in 1998, aged 56. The 63 images given to the V\u0026ampA include original Polaroids of the McCartney family that have never been seen publicly before, portraits of rock music icons including the Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix, and experimental platinum and hand-painted prints, lithographs and cyanotypes.Before marrying Paul McCartney and joining the post-Beatles group Wings, Linda Eastman was a successful photographer who in 1968 became the first woman to shoot a Rolling Stone magazine cover, of Eric Clapton.The V\u0026ampA’s senior curator of photography, Martin Barnes, visited the McCartney home to help choose the images. “In some ways, I was trying not to think of the family connection and just look at the work,” he said. “I think she had a real eye for capturing the unguarded and unstaged moment.” A selection of the McCartney images will be on display when the V\u0026ampA’s photography centre – which Barnes said would be “one of the largest single collections in the world in depth and variety” – opens to the public on 12 October.The huge RPS collection, which includes works from early pioneers in “painting with light”, was moved to Bradford in 2003 and regarded as a cornerstone of the SMM, part of the Science Museum group. In 2016 there was public outcry at the decision to move the entire collection to London. The Bradford South MP, Judith Cummins, feared the loss could threaten the viability of the SMM, which had already suffered funding and staff cuts.Barnes said the V\u0026ampA would consider exhibition tours and artefact loans with the SMM. The RPS collection, which includes books and journals, 6,000 cameras and pieces of equipment, and 270,000 photographs all being catalogued and digitised for the first time, dovetailed perfectly with the V\u0026ampA. In some cases negatives, prints and the cameras they were taken with are being reunited – including equipment and images captured by William Henry Fox Talbot, who invented some of the earliest means of permanently fixing a photographic image.Tristram Hunt, director of the V\u0026ampA, said the museum had been the first in the world to collect photographs and the first to stage a photography exhibition, because its founder Henry Cole was an enthusiastic amateur snapper. Hunt said the arrival of the RPS works was seamlessly creating a new collection that could tell the entire story of photography from daguerreotype to digital. It had been the catalyst towards creating the new spaces, which will occupy three restored 19th-century galleries, he said.The new galleries will include display cases holding 140 cameras, a historical display from the earliest experiments to a digital wall for the latest projected images. There will also be a handling collection and a “dark tent” – a projection and lecture space modelled on the travelling darkrooms used by 19th-century photographers.

Goats were never much of a threat at Kew, where the endangered species has been carefully cultivated since a specimen was found on the tiny, volcanic Robinson Crusoe Island near Chile. But rusting iron columns and creaky windows had posed a significant danger, to plants and humans alike.A government report into the state of the national botanic gardens in 2010 concluded of the building that “urgent restoration is essential if closure is to be avoided”.

For the first time since the glasshouse opened in 1862, the entire contents of the beds have been removed, soil and all, and the layout reconfigured to be more akin to the Victorian original. Ten thousand plants have been replaced with younger specimens, mostly cultivated from cuttings of their forebears, while some famous residents have been carefully returned after spending the last few years in a temporary nursery. Kew’s rarest (and loneliest) plant of all, a male Wood’s cycad, is back in position, still awaiting the discovery of a female of the species in some untrodden corner of the planet. Compared with the previous overgrown riot, where spiky leaves of cycads rubbed up against the trunks of bitter orange trees, and tree ferns competed for space with rhododendrons, it now feels more like the architecture, rather than the plants, is the star of the show.“It was heartbreaking to see some of the trees go,” says Kew’s fittingly named Greg Redwood, head of glasshouses, who has been working here for 34 years. “But some of them were hitting the roof, and it was very difficult to raise new specimens under the thick canopy.” Older plants were producing fewer seeds, making it essential to renew the collection. “After years of pruning, a lot of the plants were effectively bonsais.”The cull means that Decimus Burton’s triumph of iron and glass is fully visible for the first time in a generation. Cast-iron columns support great arcing ribs of wrought iron that leap across the space, their detail visible up close from the upper-level walkway that rings the main pavilion, providing precipitous views down to the fledging canopy. Under the guidance of heritage experts Donald Insall Associates, the ironwork has been repaired and recast in places, the decades of paintwork scrubbed off with ground garnet and repainted with five coats of the hardwearing paint used on oil rigs. Outside, the plasterwork details, previously obliterated by years of gloopy paint, are visible once again: cornucopias heave with pomegranates, pineapples and soursops, while terracotta baskets (which cleverly disguise historic chimney flues) brim with moulded flowers.Begun in 1859, the same year that Darwin’s On the Origin of Species was published, the Temperate House was to be the crowning glory of Kew, a five-pavilion complex stretching almost 200 metres atop a raised berm, like a fleet of crystal tankers processing across the lawn. It was planned to be the first thing visitors would see as they entered the gardens, standing at the end of the avenue from the station as a stately beacon. “It was Burton’s tomb to himself, twice the size of his Palm House,” says project architect Amy Felton. “But like many buildings of this size, it didn’t quite go according to plan.”During the parliamentary debate to allocate funding, the influential politician and greenhouse impresario Joseph Paxton opposed the proposed cost, insisting the building could be erected for a third of the requested budget. He warned that Kew was in danger of turning into “a gaudy flower garden”. No doubt concerned by the prospect of competition for his own Crystal Palace, then run as a private venture, his objection carried weight and the Treasury only sanctioned £10,000 for Kew’s new glasshouse, rather than the £30,000 requested. The station didn’t materialise where expected either: it was ultimately built 500 metres to the north, leaving the glasshouse stranded, away from the main entrance.By the time of Burton’s death in 1881, only the central pavilion had been completed. The unfinished building was described as a “chronic eyesore” by Kew’s director in his plea for further funds, and it would take another 18 years to see the full thing finished, by which time it had outlived two directors and its architect – 40 years after Burton had drawn up the designs. Compared with the startling futurism of his Palm House, an ethereal soap bubble formed from great sheets of curved glass, the train-shed bulk of the Temperate House was deemed to be rather prosaic.For the modern visitor, the protracted process brings added interest. The sluggish pace of the whole endeavour allows you to see the changing fashions of the day, with the latest trends embodied in its different wings. The acanthus leaf column capitals of the early phase give way to a simpler, stripped-back structure in the southern pavilion, while floral motifs on the wrought-iron trusses in the main house are later exchanged for plain circles and triangles. Windows operated with rack and pinion gears shaped like pterodactyl wings in the north pavilion become simpler elbow mechanisms in the south. What isn’t visible is the fact that in Burton’s day, the whole thing was glazed in green glass, thought by the Victorians to prevent scorching from the sun, while the ironwork, far from always being pristine white, has ranged from pale blue to dark green and brown.The renovations have opened up hundreds of clerestory windows that had been fixed shut in the 1970s, and installed lower-level apron vents, providing better cross-ventilation and air movement that will help the tree trunks to toughen up. Heating has been added in a new sunken trench, creating a more even atmosphere and allowing Kew to grow a broader range of plants. “Before, only the strong survived,” says Redwood.Wider central pathways allow access for cherrypickers, and a large crossing in the middle has clearly been sized with weddings and corporate event hire in mind – for which new lighting has been installed overhead and in the flowerbeds. For now, it’s all a little too stark. There is none of the lush magic of the Palm House, where it feels like an exotic specimen might engulf you into the dense foliage at any minute, and the wide straight aisles are less intriguing to explore than the narrower winding pathways. But the future of the building has been secured, and, given that some of the plants won’t mature for another 25, 50, or 75 years, you can rest assured that your grandchildren will have the pleasure of seeing them at their best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f442d892d5b8c4414edff4fe328a80559388188e/0_244_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=002444e5406adb030472fe8b6976dc46","title":"art shay acclaimed photographer in pictures","story":"Shay, who has died aged 96, photographed celebrities, politicians and ordinary Americans during a career that ned 70 years.

The city I worked in briefly in my youth still had mills towering over its hillsides and tycoon mansions lining Manningham Lane. The centre was a tight group of Victorian palaces and wool warehouses. It could just echo TS Eliot’s assurance, sitting “like a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire”. There were fashionable shops in Darley Street, once the Bond Street of the north, which was jammed with Rolls-Royces.Bradford council’s chief executive, Kersten England, is a woman on a mission. She burns with a determination to pull the city around, and aims “to make Bradford the Shoreditch of Yorkshire”. She declines to join the northern chorus for more grants, subsidies and attention from London. She has given up on competing with her neighbouring rival, booming Leeds. She wants “not to do things, but to help others to do them” – to facilitate the revival of an “alternative Bradford”.Undaunted, England led me through a maze of deserted alleys to her micro-Shoreditch, a subterranean warren of old storage tunnels and caves. Here a local developer, Graham Hall, has bravely invested £2m in craft beer pubs, gin bars, artisanal food outlets and music venues, cluttered with railway junk and industrial antiques. Sunbridgewells is a hipster cliche, but England sees it as ground zero of Bradford’s “creative hub”. She was so proud of it that last year she persuaded Princess Anne – hardly a hipster – to declare it open. The Shoreditch model requires others to flock to Sunbridgewells, but this has yet to happen. Waterstones has converted the old Wool Exchange into what must be its most exotic shop. A few pubs, such as the famous Sparrow, cling to life nearby. The Little Shop of Soaps briefly showed its artisanal face next to Sunbridgewells but is closing “for lack of footfall”, says its owner Tracey Lavelle. Up the road from Rawson Square is David Craig’s Assembly warehouse, host to a group of freelance designers and publishers. Craig reckons the space costs roughly half what it would in suburban Saltaire, and a fifth what it would in Leeds. But he is a pioneer. He admits he was drawn to Bradford by its underdog status and “gritty, do-it-yourself nature”. He and his colleagues “have a passion for the city”, even though only a few live there. As yet they are less a hub than an oasis.  Another champion of the new Bradford, Amir Hussain, is an architect with an expanding practice in the city’s Goitside district. He wants to persuade second- and third-generation Asians to come out of their suburban enclaves into the “centre of the donut”, bringing with them some of the ethnic vitality of the high streets and bazaars visible in the city’s encircling “villages”.  Bradford has long been victim of half a century of crisis in British town planning. Already in the 1970s the local council was committing suicide. As if to eradicate its past as capital of the wool trade, it began the demolition of its Victorian core and drove a road through the wreckage. Sites were cleared for blocks of what the Pevsner guide calls “mind-numbing banality”.  In the 1980s the city toyed with Thatcherism under the leadership of Eric Pickles. A third of people on the council payroll were sacked, some 9,000 jobs, with no compensating upturn in private employment. Tory Whitehall gave the city a meagre reward in the form of a photography museum and a tax office. One failed – its photographs were carted off to London’s V\u0026ampA – and the other is closing. Dispersal was the last thing central Bradford wanted. The council answered with a killer punch of its own. It cleared a 12-acre swathe of land behind the city hall for a giant, introverted shopping mall, Broadway. When it opened a few years ago, it killed all other retail activity in the city centre like a plague. I have never seen such commercial devastation caused by a single planning decision. It is hard not to warm to the determination of England and her team. Yorkshire cities are notoriously bad neighbours, and Bradford’s rivalry with Leeds, 10 miles away, is the stuff of history. But the city planner, Bhupinder Dev, knows his future lies in finding a relationship with Leeds. The contrast is almost obscene. Leeds seems rich. It has drawn big government investments in universities and hospitals. Towers of luxury flats line the old canal. Smart shops define the Headrow. Council leader Judith Blake told me her chief challenge was “an acute shortage of skilled labour”. To her, Bradford’s value to Leeds was almost humiliating – its unemployment rate and its output of school leavers.  Dev and England want Bradford to be “alternative” and creative. “We simply must make central Bradford a place in which people want to live, not from which they are desperate to move,” says Dev. Successful Asians, he says, are drifting away to Pudsey on the Leeds road to avoid a Bradford postcode.  Bradford has tried this before. Across the centre of town is Little Germany, a neighbourhood of handsome sandstone warehouses next to the cathedral. It was given a conservation makeover 10 years ago, and is home to the Bradford Playhouse and a scatter of studios and galleries. A large portrait of the city’s favourite son David Hockney adorns a building exterior. But Little Germany lacks critical mass and residents are wary of the place.  While music venues and arts festivals draw audiences, they do not draw residents. Somehow life must be breathed into dead Victorian streets and old mills. The spirit that once revived San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury, Manhattan’s Greenwich Village and the ever-cited Shoreditch must be found somewhere. These places recovered by sucking activity and enterprise from adjacent areas of wealth. Bradford must do that from Leeds.  The ShoreditchDetroit model requires extreme measures. It requires unused buildings to be released by their owners into a “down and out” economy. They must gradually attract artists, designers and writers, people who appear to find inspiration in dereliction. They in turn hand over to digital entrepreneurs and other “creatives”. Bradford may not be as desperate as Detroit, but the longer it sits and hopes, the more its centre will depopulate and deteriorate.  The Yorkshire economy has been tortoise to the hare of Manchester’s northern powerhouse. It has depended on the employment hotspots of Leeds and Sheffield, on prosperous farming and on tourism to York, Harrogate and the Dales. This has left “cold spots” in the old mining and mill towns, Barnsley, Rotherham, Wakefield and Huddersfield. The pits and the looms have disappeared and nothing has taken their place.  Bradford is the most challenging by far. It is lucky to have in England, her council leader, Susan Hinchliffe, and Leeds’s Judith Blake, leaders of stature and intelligence, who seem to get the point of Yorkshire’s future. They are well-placed to capitalise on a promised new dawn in Yorkshire politics, with Labour MP Dan Jarvis who will run for mayor of South Yorkshire. He is rumoured to have his eye on becoming mayor of all Yorkshire, of “God’s own county”. He might start by declaring Bradford “God’s own Shoreditch”.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2cd7cef4621b7d6e064186d1cb3414c2bd43592/387_1443_5067_3040/master/5067.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22c69d70decd58d9936c190620234d73","title":"off the map the secret cities behind the atom bomb manhattan project","story":"In 1943, three ordinary-looking US cities were constructed at record speed – but left off all maps. They had an extraordinary purpose: to create nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan projectby  David Smith in WashingtonIn 1943, three ordinary-looking US cities were constructed at record speed – but left off all maps. They had an extraordinary purpose: to create nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan projectby  David Smith in WashingtonSomething strange happened in the US state of Tennessee in 1943. Thousands of young workers poured into a 59,000-acre site about 25 miles west of Knoxville. Vast quantities of materials followed, never to re-emerge. Houses and other facilities were built with record speed. Yet officially Oak Ridge did not exist during the war and could not be found on any map.What was going on there? Very few people knew at the time, even among the residents. The answer was that this was the starting block in a race against Adolf Hitler to build the atom bomb. Oak Ridge was one of three “secret cities” of the Manhattan Project, along with Los Alamos in New Mexico and HanfordRichland in Washington state.More than 125,000 scientists, technicians and support staff occupied the three cities by the end of the war. There is a photo of a Santa Claus being frisked at the gates of Oak Ridge and a local newsletter stamped “restricted”. Anyone aged 12 or over had to wear an ID badge. The use of words such as “atomic” or “uranium” was taboo lest it tip off the enemy.Yet some social aspects were all too familiar: even these planned communities, which tried to offer residents an idyllic lifestyle and would influence postwar urban construction and design in America, replicated the racial segregation of the era.“At first glance they seem like very normal American communities,” says Martin Moeller, senior curator of the Secret Cities: The Architecture and Planning of the Manhattan Project exhibition, which opens on Thursday at the National Building Museum in Washington. “But then before long you start to see things that are strange in a variety of ways, sometimes humorous.”He offers examples: “Driving by the main hotel in Oak Ridge and seeing that the bar and lounge there is called the reactor room. Starting to see these nuclear symbols on seemingly random buildings around the place but also coming to understand that these were not just typical communities that grew up in a haphazard fashion, that there was a hand of design there even at the beginning of their existence.”It was late 1942, less than a year after the US had entered the second world war, when the US Army Corps of Engineers quietly began acquiring vast tracts of land in remote areas of three states. The few residents of these areas were summarily evicted and their houses demolished.Soon thousands of young workers arrived from far and wide, initially occupying tents and other makeshift shelters within the newly designated military reservations. Shielded from public view by natural barriers and security fences, the workers quickly erected hundreds of buildings, ranging from prefabricated houses to industrial structures of unprecedented scale.The goal was singular. Aware that the Nazis were pursuing nuclear weapons – though they were not as far along as thought at the time – the US would invest unfathomable money and manpower to get there first. The cause could scarcely have been more urgent.“Despite that, in building these communities, it was considered important to create housing in environments that were comfortable for the people who would be working for the scientists and engineers who would be doing this important work,” explains Moeller, who first visited Oak Ridge three decades ago when his future father-in-law was a nuclear physicist with the national laboratory there.“There was agreement that they needed to feel at home. They needed to have a community that felt ‘normal’. And so during this time of national emergency, the US government built single family houses in what we would now consider typical suburban neighborhoods, instead of just jamming all of these people into dormitories and barracks as I would think almost any other country in the world would have done for time. That to me, in of itself, is extraordinary.”He adds: “These cities really were proving grounds for emerging ideas about town planning architecture and construction. In many cases they were continuing movements that were already in existence.”Built from scratch in half a year to produce fuel for atomic bombs, Oak Ridge was initially conceived as a town for 13,000 people but grew to 75,000 by the end of the war, the biggest of the secret cities. The housing was designed by Skidmore, Owings \u0026amp Merrill (SOM), now one of the biggest and most influential architecture firms in the world. And yet while Oak Ridge seemed to exist in a bubble, it was also very much of its time.Moeller continues: “Although these cities were very much conceived as forward-looking communities – they really wanted places that were idyllic in many ways, great places to raise families – nonetheless segregation was designed in from the start. It was just considered to be a given by all parties concerned. There were racial issues that were baked into these communities.”SOM’s initial plan called for a “negro village” at the eastern end of town, furthest from the work sites, which was to include housing similar to that provided for white residents. But as Oak Ridge grew quicker than expected, those plans were abandoned and most African American residents were relegated to “hutments”: rudimentary plywood structures barely superior to tents.They were frigid in the winter – heated with crude stoves – and sweltering in the summer and offered little privacy. They lacked internal plumbing so residents had to use collective toilet facilities. Even married couples were not allowed to live together in the hutment camps. And residents were routinely subjected to more surveillance from the security authorities than those living in the more permanent neighbourhoods.By the end of the war, most of the white families had been moved out of the hutments and, as the population was then shrinking, went into more permanent housing. But many of the African American families continued to live in the basic dwellings until the early 1950s. There would be a twist, however. Moeller says: “In the postwar period, Oak Ridge, having now been settled as a place full of academics and very well-educated people otherwise, was one of the leaders in the desegregation movement in the south. In fact, two of the first public schools in the south to be desegregated were in Oak Ridge. Oak Ridge even threatened to secede from Tennessee in order to desegregate. So there was a relatively quick turnaround.”When the US dropped the atom bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, killing tens of thousands of people to force an end to the war, the city’s secret was out. Many residents celebrated. One local newspaper declared: “Atomic super-bomb, made at Oak Ridge, strikes Japan.” Another said: “Oak Ridge Attacks Japanese ... Workers thrill as atomic bomb secret breaks press and radio stories describe ‘fantastically powerful’ weapon expected to save many lives.”All three cities remained part of the military industrial complex, continuing to work on nuclear weapons during the cold war as well as broader scientific research today Oak Ridge is heavily involved in renewable energy. The unique subcultures that grew during their early years of isolation also survive. Moeller observes: “These people really in many ways had to commit to create their own culture and interestingly, even to this day, some of the little theatre companies and musical troupes that were formed during world war two still exist and still operate as community cultural organisations in theses cities.”That includes “atomic culture”, or, to put it another way, gallows humour. At one of the most popular lunch spots in Oak Ridge, there are pictures of mushroom clouds on the wall. The logo of Richland high school contains a mushroom cloud. “There are pictures of atomic symbols and so on and I hasten to point out that that’s not because the residents of these communities are callous.“They realise the seriousness of the work that was done in those places during the war and afterwards during the cold war. But it’s kind of like doctors’ humour in emergency rooms. They’re somewhat notorious for being irreverent in their humor about medical conditions. It’s how they deal with the seriousness of what they do.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a9f0c34a41fb8ddb8b40057ab68bcb4687edf0/0_91_2745_1647/master/2745.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03b33638381ee5ec41ccc4970759f8b8","title":"harry meghan pay as you go wedding commoners royal wedding","story":"Oh, how the monarchy is modernising! Look at lovely, jokey Harry with his openness about mental health and his glowing fiancee, who astonishingly has had a life, is not a dumb blonde and says things about female independence. Oh, how they have moved on, this new generation of royals. They are just like us, after all.Except they are not. So the latest news about the commoners invited to the royal wedding is really stunning in its declaration of who’s who and what’s what. Kensington Palace (probably using the retch-inducing phrase “reach out”) announced earlier this year that Meghan and Harry were going “to allow members of the public to join in their celebration”. Very special people representing “youth” and “ersity” and – whisper it quietly – poor people would be allowed inside the perimeter of Windsor Castle. This is not just a wedding, remember, this is an attempt to build a bridge between high society and well … society.Twelve-hundred hand-picked “ordinary” people, many from charities that the royals support, will be let into the castle’s grounds. They will be there for hours and hours, and yet, it seems, they will not get so much as a vol-au-vent. Those who work with deprived and alienated people have been advised in letters from lord lieutenants “to bring a picnic lunch as it will not be possible to buy food and drink on site”. What? What kind of invite is that?It’s one that absolutely makes clear what is happening. That’s what. It never had anything to do with altruism. These ordinary people will effectively be extras for the TV coverage. They’ll make up a crowd that will be beamed around the world. The royals’ net wealth is estimated at around £400m – but now let us bow down before our rulers and hope that a garage sandwich will tide us over. Oh, I know it is not a good time to be a republican but quite honestly it never is. No one can begrudge the Queen, no one can’t admire the loveliness of Meghan, and on it goes. Only that kind of thinking is how this fountainhead of inequality is always made palatable.I once refused to go to a wedding because there was a pay bar as well as one of those irritating wedding lists. So I am not a great one for a pay-as-you-go celebrations. I can’t see it as anything other than meanness. Have a party or don’t. These occasions are actually very boring for spectators: hours of waiting around for a fleeting glimpse of a gloved hand as it speeds past. I was in the cathedral for Diana’s funeral, and on the way there we went past the crowds who had been sleeping in the street overnight. Weirdly, I was at Windsor for Harry’s father’s “low-key” wedding to Camilla, hoping, I suppose, for the ghost of Diana to appear. The crowds were quite sparse but had their flags to wave. What makes people wait for hours to do this, I remember asking a bored policeman. “We call them cat-stranglers,” he said. I didn’t know what that meant. “Women so mad they strangle their own cats,” he informed me.Now, though, the royalist media will go into overdrive and there will be a lot of reverential dross about protocol and etiquette. Debrett’s advises at least six canapes per guest before a wedding lunch. Harry and Meghan’s 600 actual guests will get the works, but the people chosen because they serve the most vulnerable in their communities will be left milling about for hours and are now Googling Windsor for the nearest supermarkets.As a metaphor for inclusivity royal-style, though, it’s all perfect, isn’t it? Do please come and gawp and cheer, but bring your own sandwiches. The meanness of the super-rich is truly something to behold. Twenty-one-year-old Saeed Atcha told the  that the news made him wonder if he should go to a nearby McDonald’s, but he wasn’t sure whether he’d be allowed to bring in a filet meal. He set up a magazine in Bolton after the 2011 riots and talked of the bemusement of some of the disadvantaged people his charity helps that the royals will scarcely offer invitees a drink. “It’s unfathomable,” he said. Not really, it’s the monarchy. Same as it ever was."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17a6b639b122aff50982328b3b2c280bb7dba176/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ff819b800044015c66aab4bf242519c","title":"sajid javid father immigration poverty british pakistani tory","story":"There is too much lazy thinking when it comes to the elevation of minorities. There is nothing in Javid’s record to suggest his promotion will benefit others with similar backgroundsSajid Javid’s father, Abdul, came to Britain from Pakistan with a pound in his pocket and became a bus driver in Rochdale. As a six-year-old, Sajid used to interpret for his mother, Zubaid, who took 10 years to learn English. At one stage Sajid shared a room with his parents in a two-bedroom house where he lived with his four brothers. His school careers adviser told him to be a TV repair man since children like him should not aim too high. Instead he was the first in his family to go to university, became the youngest ever vice-president at Chase Manhattan bank and then went on to become a board member of Deutsche Bank before entering parliament in 2010.We know this because Javid often evokes his personal story, as any skilled politician might, for effect. Monday, when he replaced Amber Rudd as home secretary, was no different. On his first day on the job, Javid insisted that the Windrush scandal was to him not just political, but personal. “Like the Caribbean Windrush generation, my parents came to this country from the Commonwealth in the 1960s,” he said. “So when I heard that people who are outstanding pillars of their community were being impacted simply for not having the right documents to prove their legal status in the UK, I thought it could be my mum, my brother, my uncle – even me.”But, for all the talk about how Javid’s elevation should be celebrated as evidence of a government broadening its pool of talent at the highest level, the truth is that, were it up to the policies of this government, there would be no Javid. His father would never have been allowed in. And Javid’s OK with that. “It’s absolutely right that today we should have an immigration policy based more on skills,” he told the  three years ago.If ever there was an illustration of the distinction between the symbolic value of representation and the substantial need to redress systemic inequality, it is this: a man who extols his own story as an example of what is possible, even as he actively seeks to ensure that this story should be denied to those who come after him. To those who see ersity as an end in itself, rather than a means of securing greater equality and less discrimination, Javid’s promotion denotes meaningful progress. That is the sloppy liberal thinking on which rightwing opportunism thrives, and which Angela Davis once described to me as “the difference that brings no difference and the change that brings no change”. Symbols should not be mistaken for substance, lest we end up not with equal opportunities for many, but photo opportunities for a few.But they should not be dismissed as entirely insubstantial either. In a cabinet where there are more former Oxford Union presidents than there are minorities, it matters that the state school-educated son of Pakistani migrants has a top job that covers policing, immigration and security. He brings a set of experiences, from discrimination to family poverty, that are lacking in the highest levels of government.The fact that he is a millionaire and a Tory does not insulate him from racism. On the Guido Fawkes website, a Conservative site where bigots go to reinforce their rage, his appointment was greeted with the following comments: “It rather appears the white man’s burden has moved in with us for good” “He’s looking forward to being joined by millions of others from Turkey” and “Never trust an Arab.” (Let’s forget that Pakistan is not in the Arab world and further from Turkey than Britain.)A few, accusing him of racial treachery, called him a “coconut” (black on the outside, white on the inside) and a token. That is offensive. His race does not define him. Who we are does not determine what we do or what we think. There is nothing intrinsic about being of Pakistani origin that prevents someone becoming a Conservative.So there is symbolic value to his appointment. But unlike the comedian George Carlin, I think symbols are far too important to be left to the symbol-minded. Symbolic advances are far more limited and contingent than their advocates generally admit. The first black leader of a significant political party in the Netherlands was Joao Varela, a migrant who briefly headed Pim Fortuyn’s anti-immigration party after Fortuyn was assassinated. The French far right Front National has black supporters and had a handful of non-white representatives Ben Carson, the housing and urban development secretary under Donald Trump, last year referred to slaves as immigrants. Should we claim the advances of all these people as victories for ersity? If not then, clearly, we have to be careful about what symbols we are promoting.I’m delighted for Meghan Markle and her upcoming nuptials with Prince Harry. But those who claim it marks a step forward for black people in Britain fail to engage with the symbol in question. A royal family establishes inherited privilege at the heart of our system of government and embeds patronage at the centre of our politics. The prospect of a black princess illustrates that black people can now be as elitist, exclusory and hierarchical as whites, and that white elites are prepared to accept them on those terms.Which brings us back to Javid, who comes not only with an ethnicity but a record. He has consistently voted for tougher immigration and asylum laws, including the “hostile environment” policy, and for slashing benefits to the poor. There is no evidence that he has ever leveraged his experiences as the child of working-class migrants to do anything positive for migrants, their children or the working class (British-Pakistanis have among the highest rates of unemployment and poverty). He recognises that those threatened with deportation could have been his parents he fails to acknowledge that he voted for the very policies that would have facilitated their removal and, unless he changes the policy, could be their deporter.The Windrush scandal has perfectly illustrated that racism is not simply a matter of mean-spirited iniduals doing bad things – though it can be that too – but a system that excludes and marginalises people of colour. The point is not to change the identities of the people operating that system, but to dismantle it and build something fairer. When ersity is about a system looking different but acting the same, it serves not the excluded but the system itself.It is clear what this promotion does for Javid I have yet to hear a convincing case for what it might do for people who look like him or share his background. Javid may have broken through the glass ceiling, but it’s difficult to see what use that is to those trapped in the basement.

The European commission and member states must share the blame for what is developing into an expensive squabble with very disturbing implications for post-Brexit relationships. The immediate argument is about Britain’s possible exclusion from the next phase of Galileo-related contracts. Already the Galileo back-up centre has been moved from Hampshire to Spain. Much more damagingly, the EU is proposing the UK’s long-term exclusion from the “public regulated service” part of the network. This is an encrypted service for the police, security and emergency services of EU member states. Britain has been deeply involved in its development and British agencies are anxious to participate in it when it is operational. Since January, however, the commission has argued that Britain should be excluded because the system’s integrity would be compromised if it were accessible to a non-EU state.This is an absurdly bureaucratic and hostile stance to take towards a country that, Brexit or not, is and always will be an intimate European ally on all security issues. This newspaper holds no brief for Brexit or for Theresa May, but the prime minister has been clear that security cooperation with Europe must be fully maintained in spite of Brexit. She is right about that. But the EU’s short-sightedness may now be provoking an over-reaction in London. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is said, in his frustration, to be trying to block the transfer of sensitive cryptographical expertise to French companies in the project and is threatening that the UK may go it alone with a separate satellite system, costing at least £5bn.

The thieves got in through a first-floor window and targeted seven display cases containing culturally significant objects including jade figures. They ignored other items, suggesting the burglary was carefully planned. “It’s personal for the team as well. The reward of the job for us is showing the collection, the culture and art of east Asia to the general public and we were forced to close.” The museum upgraded its security in 2016 so it could borrow objects from the British Museum but is having to review its arrangements again. Chiang said: “They seemed quite professional. They were targeting jade and gold objects.” But she said the museum would be no less welcoming to the public: “The art needs to be seen otherwise it loses its value.” The gallery will reopen to the public on Saturday in time to celebrate its 25th anniversary, though the room that was broken into is still closed. The shattered display cabinets remain empty. Visitors will instead be treated to an exhibition by the Chinese artist Zhang Yanzi called A Quest for Wellness – an appropriate subject for Bath, where people have visited the city’s hot springs for many centuries.The centrepiece of the exhibition is a silk robe brightly decorated in tablets donated to the artist by her friends. Another piece comprises gauze bandages daubed with cinnabar moulded into the shape of mountains a third is a collection of bracelets made out of pills. Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, said small museums like the MEAA were the lifeblood of the city and needed to feel secure. “Bath is a city with lots of small museums.” she said. “They help our city thrive. They are one of the reasons so many come here. We really need to help and support them and make sure they can do well in an atmosphere in which they feel protected.” She said the raid should make the police think twice about the closure of the main police station in the area. Hobhouse said: “Unfortunately we’ve lost our police station in Bath. That sort of thing makes it easier for professional criminals. We should reflect on that and think again whether we should have our police station back. “Local people have been very uncomfortable about not having a police station. We can’t say it’s a direct causal link but it may have made a difference.”The raid on the MEAA in Bennett Street took place at about 1.20am on 17 April. Police, who reached the scene within five minutes of receiving an alert, said the burglary was well planned and swift, and that the artefacts may have been stolen to order.Based close to the Royal Crescent, the MEAA bills itself as the only UK museum dedicated to the arts and cultures of eastern and south-eastern Asia. It opened in 1993 and features thousands of objects from the region. Some of its Chinese art dates from 5000BC.The police said the items taken were a jade monkey holding a peach, jade mandarin ducks with lotus flowers, an inlaid wooden covered box, a soapstone figure of the Han dynasty scholar, writer and jester, Dongfang Shuo, a set of 14 gold belt plaques and a Jizhou stoneware vase.• The Bath Museum of East Asian Art reopens with A Quest for Wellness on 5 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e35c98cd6c53b424b57de66b6882dbbc340caea/0_50_1055_633/master/1055.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9886b26a949ac33d0378a9b41f69f082","title":"class struggle working class unemployed become t shirt slogans","story":"T-shirts emblazoned with words such as “working class” and “broke” have become a weird micro trend in fashion. It’s just the latest example of fashion revelling in poverty chicThe old adage “It’s hip to be square” needs updating. These days, it’s glam to be poor.This product was not unique. A few months previously, H\u0026ampM ran a line of garish orange tracksuits bearing the moniker “Unemployed”. Again, there was a furore online: “Funny how H\u0026ampM has a jumper with the slogan ‘unemployed’ for, like, £25. I’m employed and don’t have £25 for a jumper,” shot back one Twitter user. The products were removed from sale.  contacted H\u0026ampM, but the company declined to comment on the product or its removal. It does, however, currently have a new orange hoodie with the word “Broke” emblazoned on it on sale for £19.99. There are plenty of other poverty-celebrating slogans for sale. BooHoo retails a “Young Dumb Broke” T-shirt, while Baby Girls Club and Pink Uzi offer “Too Poor for Dior” options. Wuggle offers a whole colour palette of “Council Estate Princess” slogan items. DonkeyTees, TeePublic and other brands have capitalised on Kristen Wiig’s Bridesmaids one-liner “Help Me, I’m Poor”.In past PR scandals, retailers have often claimed that any offence was entirely accidental that they did not anticipate the meaning that many people from, say, Liverpool would draw from its red 96 top (the retailer said it was designed as a reference to a 1996 Bob Marley remix). Slogan tops that glamorise words clearly linked with poverty, however, can claim no such defence. Rather, Charis Thompson, a professor of sociology at LSE, advises that in order to understand this phenomenon, we need to ask: “Who is buying these items? Is it lower-income people in defiance or pride? Or is it middle-class consumers ‘slumming it’ to be cool?” T-shirts with slogans such as “working class” and “unemployed” appear to be the fast-fashion equivalent of a trend that has permeated luxury fashion for decades. It’s an exhausted obsession with the aesthetics of the council estate – one which is frequently appropriated by retailers and consumers who, if they can afford it, don’t have knowledge of the lived pain behind it. Dozens of brands have used the aesthetics of the working classes to sell three or four-figure products. Vetements even describes its cotton-mix tracksuit trousers as “chav lounge pants” (which retail at £500), while Nordstrom’s imitation workers’ jeans, designed to look like the wearer has just finished a day’s work on a construction site, are another case in point – they cost $425 (£313). What plasterer’s son could – or would? – fork out for those? Burberry – a brand which, in the noughties, embarked on a comprehensive campaign to rid its check prints of their association with so-called “chav culture” – has recently embraced that check again, collaborating with Gosha Rubchinskiy on a range that revels in Burberry check and sees jackets retail for £1,095.At the more affordable end of the scale, the trend was evident in the rise of the Nu-Lads movement in men’s fashion, with sportswear brands that had been long associated with “council-estate chic” finding new life as a sort of counter-movement to the hipster fad. Even more recently, in what must be the most offensive example of poverty-porn fashion yet, Puma threw a “House of Hustle” PR party inspired by council estate drug dealing. One London social worker, Amber Gilbert Coutts, wrote an open letter to Puma condemning the glamorisation of “exacerbated deprivation and community pain”. All this feels particularly distasteful when you consider the much-documented human cost of fast fashion. As recently as 2015, H\u0026ampM was found to be paying female workers a pittance in Cambodia, and in 2016 it was found to be using 14-year-old workers in Myanmar. Garments emblazoned with words such as “Unemployed” make their very existence a punchline.Writer and campaigner Paris Lees, who became the first trans woman in Britain to be featured in British Vogue earlier this year, made an appearance on BBC Question Time recently wearing hoop earrings and a tight ponytail – a look she describes as “council estate chic”. It’s a look she knows well, having grown up on one. “It just makes me laugh seeing all these posh people in east London spending loads of money to look like poor kids like me did in the 90s and 00s,” Lees says. “I mean, it’s a bit classless isn’t it, wearing a T-shirt saying you’re unemployed if you know you’ve got the safety net of a nice middle-class family and a decent university degree? The poorest and most vulnerable people in society are being hit hardest by the current economic and political regime, and it’s not funny, trendy or ironic. It’s a very real struggle just to survive.”Alison Thewliss, MP for Glasgow Central, a constituency in which the  reported that almost half of children grow up below the poverty line, agrees: “Problems of poverty and unemployment are serious, complex ones, and trivialising them by adorning them on premium clothes seeks to help no one other than the companies that are selling them – often at eye-watering prices.” For many others in constituencies such as Thewliss’s, the word “unemployed” can evoke a visceral, even existential, fear. It’s a label few working-class people would embrace, especially when the tabloid media demonises unemployed working-class people as welfare cheats and scroungers.Broadly, the Vice channel, reported last year that socialist memes have become social currency for young people (we can largely thank Jeremy Corbyn for that). If Marxism is the new millennial buzzword, it makes sense that the youth want to distance themselves from wealth. As we have seen from the popularity of the oft-reported notion of the “oppression Olympics” – groups of people competing to be more hard-done-by than the other – it turns out that there is a lot of social capital in being poor in 2018. However, while many may read slogans such as “unemployed” and “working class” as cutesy, conscientious objections to capitalism, or reminders of their gap years, for many working-class people – for whom being unemployed is a life-threatening instability – having them stamped in black letters is just a crude iteration of exploitation by the fashion industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5020f6bd8514329b93d6d348365d451db57ce89/1090_151_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c3c33f6babcd0d62f78c9c6590e1ace","title":"theres this idea that mothers are completely selfless diablo cody on tully and the juno backlash","story":"The Oscar-winning writer’s new film is about an exhausted mother slowly unravelling. She talks about the impact of motherhood, facing middle-age – and what she’d now change about JunoMotherhood isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Or at least it isn’t black and white, more of a stretched, washed-out, flesh-coloured maternity-bra shade inbetween, according to screenwriter Diablo Cody’s new film Tully. A decade on from her Academy Award-winning teen pregnancy rom-com Juno, Cody has created another lead who is expecting, this time turning Charlize Theron into baggy-eyed mum Marlo, who is one frozen pizza dinner away from the edge. She shouts. She accidentally drops an iPhone on her baby’s head. She slumps in front of her children, post-birth belly hanging out, much to their horror. Deflated, running on empty, she resembles a whoopee cushion being sat on in slow motion. Parenting has never looked so relatable.Cody, 39, says she is a different Diablo from the one who sashayed down the 2008 Oscars red carpet in head-to-toe leopard print to collect her award for Juno’s screenplay. She wrote the rom-com in a month while sitting in Starbucks, and it took her from part-time stripper-blogger to star overnight. Her projects since Juno haven’t quite matched that film’s pop culture-puncturing potential: Megan Fox horror dud Jennifer’s Body a Spielberg-produced TV series, United States of Tara, which lasted three seasons underrated rock comedy Ricki and the Flash brilliant but cancelled Amazon Prime series One Mississippi, which she co-created with standup Tig Notaro. But one aspect that has remained constant is her focus on creating female characters that defy the ordinary. Meryl Streep’s ageing rocker in 2015’s Ricki and the Flash, based on Cody’s mother-in-law, was particularly important – “a woman who had chosen to pursue her passion at the expense of her children, and she was viewed as a monster because of that,” she says. “We’re surrounded by men who have made that choice and are not demonised in the same way.”Tully is the third film in her trilogy with Jason Reitman, and the second with Theron after Young Adult, and again offers a view on the female experience that Cody rarely sees onscreen. And so there are money issues, a sexless marriage with a fairly useless husband, the exasperation at not knowing how to care for a young son with undiagnosed special needs. Sensing her desperation, Marlo’s brother buys the baby shower gift that every strained mother dreams of: help. Tully is a night nanny who breezily glides in, all toned abs and tanned limbs, to do the twilight shift so Marlo can rest. She’s a Manic Pixie Dream Girl version of Maria von Trapp, but also a device to help Marlo question what parts of herself have been lost under the tummy-huggers.Cody can relate. After having kids, she says, the question of “How do you access the person that you once were?” is something she grapples with. “I feel like a completely different human being on a cellular level since having children.” Not just through a loss of identity – in the film, Marlo is also suffering from postnatal depression, which Cody says there’s still a stigma around. She doesn’t say whether she had post-natal depression herself but does confirm she felt “that emptiness” for a while. “We’re told that we should feel completely blissed out after we have a baby, and that’s not always how women feel. It comes down to this idea that mothers are supposed to be completely selfless and if you’re indulging feelings of sadness or depression, that could be perceived by other people as selfish.”Tully isn’t just about parenting, however: “It’s about the great and intense transformation of middle age. It’s waking up and going: ‘Oh my God, I’m 40 – what happened?’” Is she feeling apprehensive about that coming milestone? “Yeah, and it’s strange. For years I’ve been regarded as ‘a young screenwriter’, or someone who has achieved a lot for her age. But no one’s going to give you a cookie for achieving something at 40. At this point, the pressure’s on me to perform and to sustain that. And also, we all know how older women are regarded, particularly in Hollywood. So it’s a little scary to think: ‘Oh, I will be discarded – that’s going to happen.’”Talking to Cody about these pressures, you wonder why she hasn’t been much involved in the wider public conversation about women in Hollywood that has occurred in the past year. Reading old interviews with her, Cody was outspoken and outraged, but recently her voice has been eerily absent she quit Twitter in 2015 and hasn’t considered rejoining. “I’ve been expressing my viewpoint in my art for more than a decade now, so everybody knows that I’m a feminist,” she says. “I don’t think my voice would’ve been valuable in that conversation because, honestly, I don’t think Twitter is desperate for another quirky white woman spouting her opinion. Let’s hear from voices we don’t hear from.”Still, she is encouraged by the Time’s Up movement, even if she initially doubted its staying power. “I’m such a cynic that, when it first started happening, I was on a group text with a lot of my girlfriends, and they were all so excited and I was like: ‘This won’t last. Men in power are going to shut this down so fast.’ And then it didn’t, it just grew and grew. So I’m glad that I was proven wrong.”Cody says she is “heartened” too by the progress that Hollywood is making with “the types of roles that are being written for women. When I started out, a TV show or a film about a difficult woman was a hard sell, and now it’s something that people are soliciting from me.” But she finds it frustrating that women aren’t allowed to fail in the same way as men. “It drives me crazy that if a woman directs a movie and it doesn’t perform, people say: ‘Oh, they shouldn’t have let a woman direct it.’” . Cody’s own directorial debut, the 2013 comedy drama Paradise, was made while she was pregnant, and was subsequently panned by critics. “If a man directs a movie and it flops, there’s literally no discussion of the director’s gender,” she adds. “As a woman in a field where women are underrepresented, you often feel like you are representing women, and that’s ridiculous.”With Tully, Cody does seem to have come full circle since Juno. Knowing what she knows now about childbirth, would she have done anything about her first film differently? “In terms of pregnancy, no,” she says. “But I don’t feel I was clear enough in terms of why Juno chose to not have an abortion. It was simply because she did not want to.”The film was criticised by some for portraying abortion in a “negative” light. “It was not about any type of feeling that abortion was wrong – I’m pro-choice,” Cody says. “So for it to be interpreted as an anti-choice movie, that’s upsetting to me.”The Juno backlash is one reason that she has become “more private”. She refuses to self-censor – “it hasn’t affected my writing” – but says: “It’s certainly affected the way that I talk to people about the projects. I’ve become very boring because I want to protect myself and my children. I would like to just keep a low profile and continue to work, and I’ve had to really stay under the radar in order to accomplish that.”It’s depressing that a forthright person such as Cody has been forced to retreat from the public eye. But, like Marlo, she sees a “joy” in embracing a life more ordinary. “I take great pride in my boring life, because it’s not easy for me to be sedate. I’m a naturally curious, impulsive, self-destructive person. And I’ve had to put all that aside as a mum. I’m proud of that because it’s required a lot of discipline.”• Tully is released on 4 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cfbf7497e5eaa571e3ea0944faee623fa780cf7/0_90_2240_1344/master/2240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74c50c5fb30a847e95952e2ff54804ff","title":"atletico madrid arsenal europa league semi final match report","story":"For Arsène Wenger, there will be no happy ending. “Rumbo hacia Lyon,” (road to Lyon) read the huge banner unfurled by the most boisterous section of Atlético Madrid supporters before this victory. Diego Simeone’s team are, as promised, on their way to the Europa League final and whatever tributes come for Wenger over the next 10 days – the promise of a statue, perhaps, or even a stand named in his honour at the Emirates – it will not be how he wanted the story to finish.All that is left now is Sunday’s home game against Burnley, followed by the trips to Leicester and Huddersfield, and perhaps it is a fitting end to a season of drift. Arsenal came up short, as they often do against elite teams, and when they needed something special in the second half, losing to Diego Costa’s goal, they did not have the personnel to deliver it. Arsenal barely summoned a chance and the late onslaught that might have been anticipated never really materialised. There was only one goal in it – yet Arsenal were obliging opponents for a team with Atlético’s defensive expertise.This was Atlético’s 12th successive clean sheet at this stadium – an incredible run that goes back to 20 January and covers 1,097 minutes in play – and that parsimonious defending was the difference over the two legs. Atlético were brilliantly efficient at the back whereas it is more than 10 years since the same could be said of Wenger’s teams. He has never won a European trophy and, yes, it would have been a lovely way to go out after 22 years as Arsenal’s manager. Atlético, however, give the impression that fairytale endings are just that – for fairytales.On top of everything else, Arsenal also lost Laurent Koscielny to a ruptured achilles tendon, an injury that will have ramifications for France. Koscielny, who has been nursing a long-standing problem, went down in such a way the seriousness of the injury immediately became apparent.He pounded the turf in pain and frustration and his reaction was of a man who must have known straight away what it meant for his hopes of playing in the World Cup. Koscielny was supposed to retire after this summer’s tournament instead, he will not be involved with Didier Deschamps’s team in Russia.David Ospina Did not spread confidence. Involved in a few mix-ups. Poor kicking. Saved from Torres late on. 6Héctor Bellerín Caught on wrong side and out-muscled for Costa’s goal. Passed up promising situations on counter. 5Shkodran Mustafi Much-maligned defender stood up to Costa. Made a host of important tackles and interceptions. 7Laurent Koscielny Victim of early achilles horror, when he slipped and felt his leg buckle. Taken off on a stretcher. NANacho Monreal Willing attacking outlet, pressed high, made runs. Struggled badly for end product. 5Aaron Ramsey Chance in front of goal on 52 minutes – could not muster power. Worked to stretch Atlético. 6Granit Xhaka Nobody on the field saw more of the ball. Generally sound with it. Went close with a long-range shot. 6Jack Wilshere Tidy in possession, trademark quick feet, tried to drive the team. Walked off slowly when subbed. 5Mesut Özil Looked smooth, as usual, but flicks did not always come off. Lacked killer touch. 5Alexandre Lacazette In-form striker was suffocated. One flicker in area on 28 minutes but touch heavy. 5Danny Welbeck Preferred to Mkhitaryan because of his work rate, he could not make anything happen. 5Ratings by David HytnerHypothetical now, but perhaps Arsenal might have coped better with Costa and Antoine Griezmann if their captain had lasted longer than seven minutes. Then again, Koscielny was badly at fault for Griezmann’s goal in the first leg. Griezmann had another fine game and when the two Atlético forwards combined at the end of the first half, in the time added on for Koscielny’s treatment, it led to the game’s decisive moment.The goal showed the qualities of both players. Griezmann’s pass was beautifully weighted and once Costa had got behind Héctor Bellerín it was always going to be difficult for the Arsenal right-back to make up for his positional error. Bellerín might have been faster but Costa was stronger, shielding the ball with his body while expertly holding off his opponent. David Ospina, who had endured a nervous opening 45 minutes, advanced from his line and Costa swept the ball past Arsenal’s goalkeeper with a confident left-foot finish.Until the point the Arsenal supporters, positioned in the most vertiginous levels of this sweeping new-build stadium, must have been pleasantly surprised by the way their team had set about the game.All the same, Wenger’s men had a lot of the ball without doing a great deal with it. Mesut Özil, for instance, was prominently involved without being able to pick out a killer pass. Atlético have conceded only 18 goals in 35 La Liga appearances this season and Arsenal needed more from their attacking players. Danny Welbeck and Alexandre Lacazette were disappointing.In the second half Arsenal were attacking the end where their supporters were gathered and there were some encouraging moments early on. Granit Xhaka’s low shot brought the first noteworthy save from Jan Oblak and there were even a few moments of carelessness from the home team’s defenders.Bellerín’s surging runs from right-back were another feature and midway through the second half Wenger brought on Henrikh Mkhitaryan to increase his team’s attacking threat at the expense of Jack Wilshere.Arsenal still found it difficult to get behind Atlético’s expertly organised defence. Mkhitaryan put one shot over the crossbar and the referee, Gianluca Rocchi, was too lenient on the sporadic occasions when Wenger’s team found themselves in encouraging positions and Simeone’s players – streetwise, to the end – gave away deliberate free-kicks.Arsenal seemed to lose belief in the final exchanges and that, perhaps, was the most disappointing part. There was no burst of late pressure, no moving a defender into attack, no gambling – and, more than anything, no spark. The final whistle sounded and Wenger was quickly gone.Jan Oblak Had to push away one Xhaka shot but otherwise untroubled – a testament to Atlético’s defensive effort. 6Thomas Partey Immense physical presence, the midfielder showed discipline and class out of position at right-back. 7José Maria Giménez Made a series of clearances, good in the air. Helped to keep the door bolted. 8Diego Godín Yet again a rock at the heart of the defence. Always touch tight. Used all of his experience. 8Lucas Hernández Converted centre-back, he had nothing to worry about from either Özil or Welbeck. 7Koke Had more touches than anybody in red and white. Generally tidy. Emphasis on containment. 6Gabi Took no quarter in the challenge, spoiled, broke up play. Booked for cynical foul. 6Saúl Attritional rather than spectacular. Priority was to stop Arsenal counters. Booked for cynical foul. 6Vitolo Struggled to make an impression from the left. Guilty of some loose passing. 6Diego Costa Bristled with physical menace, defenders bounced off him. Took his goal with clinical cool. 8Antoine Griezmann Quickened the pulse when he found space. Lovely assist for Costa. Cute touches throughout. 8Ratings by David Hytner"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efd73a9df2190368b1e3d08e5474834e13c55477/3_238_3411_2047/master/3411.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08e605beb966aa2b3b70fcc2a0b88dbc","title":"jurgen klopp thrash metal chord english ideal","story":"According to Benjamin Disraeli Rome symbolises the ideal of conquest. Not quite yet, it doesn’t. Liverpool may have earned their moments of unbound joy inside the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday, capped by a lovely interlude as Jürgen Klopp went bowling through the security lines to exchange a little joyful energy with the Liverpool fans, waving his arms like a drunken dad at Christmas, all goofy warmth and unaffected pleasure in a shared achievement.But as Klopp pointed out, nothing has been settled just yet. The run to the final has had its memorable subplots. From James Milner’s elevation to the status, on the season’s stats, of most creative player in the history of modern European football. To the sustained excellence of Andy Robertson. To the spectacle of players as erse as Loris Karius and Ragnar Klavan blocking it out en route to a Champions League final.Still, no permanent mark has been made and certainly Real Madrid will present a different kind of obstacle. For the first time this season Liverpool face a meeting with European aristocracy. Deep down Real will see them as extras in this show, a disposable piece of ballast, there to provide a backdrop to the imperial parade.Yet for all that it is perhaps time to park thoughts of Kiev and wallow just a little in the moment, because Klopp is wrong in one sense. Something significant has already been achieved just by making it to this stage. First for Klopp himself and second for English football, so angst-ridden in its endless search for things such as identity and purpose, for the right DNA, the right borrowed suit of clothes.Yes: it’s time to talk about Jürgen – and about us. Man is never so manly as when he feels deeply and acts boldly. That was also Disraeli but it could at a pinch be a Klopp-ism, just without the guffaws and the swearing and the slang, a Victorian translation of one of those asides tossed into his rambling late-night press conferences where you sit up and think, hang on, what did he just say?Liverpool have been down this road but the boldness, the deep feeling of this team, is Klopp’s own work. This is a manager who has done that rare thing of rebuilding a team entirely in his own image in the space of two years and eight months. Klopp signed eight of the Liverpool players on the pitch in Rome and gave another his professional debut. There is nothing in this team that isn’t basted in his juices. Liverpool lost their best (inherited) player in January and still got better on the back of it – got a new best player, a better best player.Klopp has always been a systems manager. He remains wedded to his founding revelation at Mainz that the right tactics implemented correctly can beat better players, a theme he has returned to often in the current run.This is the other big thing about this Liverpool team in a Champions League final. As Emlyn Hughes once said: “The greatest good you can do for another is not to share your riches but to reveal to him his own.” Actually that was also Disraeli but it captures Klopp’s potential to affect English football more widely.Real are fitting opponents in this sense. Liverpool’s 4-0 defeat of pre-Ronaldo Madrid in March 2009 is an overlooked staging point in the modern history of European club football. It was after seeing their team physically overpowered by Gerrard and Mascherano, Kuyt and Carragher (and also Babel, Spearing and Dossena) that Real made a slight change of policy, re-gearing to match the power of the Premier League. That summer 13 players left. Cristiano Ronaldo arrived, as did Karim Benzema and Liverpool’s own Xabi Alonso and Álvaro Arbeloa.That Premier League intensity had revealed something to Real, offered a route to further riches. The hope now is that Klopp’s example may do something similar for English football. Like it or not Liverpool are deeply Premier League, oddly indigenous in their style.This is a distinction, not a judgment. For all the brilliance of Manchester City, it is a fact that the Pep Guardiola system is entirely its own entity – no less or no more valid, but with its own distinct fascinations and contrasts. Whereas Liverpool’s hard-pressing, chancy physicality just feels like an unusually good fit with the strangely persistent texture and tone of the game in this country, the way qualities such as pace and power and the eagerness to play at speed still emerge even through the prism of Premier League cosmopolitanism.Perhaps this idea of shared identity should not matter: football is a global, borderless entity now, existing only in that square of green. But the notion of different footballing cultures, of an English way, certainly matters to Klopp, who has spoken in these pages of the benefits of mining that source, of exploring its deep roots. There were seven English players on the pitch at various times over the two legs and at its most intense the Klopp thrash-metal style just feels like it should be English.Before the quarter-final Fernandino had called Liverpool a long-ball team, which clearly is not true but does reflect the rather overlooked synergy between the pressing style and classic direct football of the 1950s. Both are designed to provide creativity out of broken play, whether through airborne assault or well-drilled pressing, the kind of attack that can feed like a shoal of piranhas off a state of engineered disorder.This is what Premier League football looks like, at least in the hopeful imagination, or could or should look like. That is has been created by a German, led from the front by a Brazilian and a Senegalese and given a dusting of genius by an Egyptian only adds to the gaiety.Perhaps Liverpool really will be able to assert their own strengths in Kiev, to summon up the fury of the Red Zone. Some will pore fretfully over the weaknesses in Liverpool’s backline, albeit these are mirrored in Real’s own regally dozy approach to the common mud of marking and tracking back.One other thing, though: a one-off final suits Liverpool much better than the more unforgiving exam over two legs. Finals can be crazy, adrenal things, there to be wrenched away in a fateful 20-minute surge. Now, who does that remind you of?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d45258003eb6ce7ba9732accc8cc7f14e152a5/360_1704_4184_2509/master/4184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c86ae74ee3bfec8a7bd998962ded263","title":"jose mourinho managing expectations manchester united manager","story":"The Manchester United manager has consistently managed to win things – even when he does not have the best teamAccording to José Mourinho, it took him “20 years to become an overnight success”. Having spent a few days this week on the final part of my Uefa pro licence coaching course, I am beginning to appreciate what he meant when he said that. Hours in the classroom and on the pitch, as well as giving presentations to fellow students, has made me more appreciative of the hard work that goes into qualifying to be able to do a job that I don’t even know if I will one day be lucky enough to get.Studying also gives an insight into the commitment, passion and application which someone like Mourinho has had to put into football in order to achieve the level of success he has. In a week when the world has been praising the courageous and attacking football which has taken Liverpool to the Champions League final, I have to say that I have just as much admiration and respect for the Manchester United manager as I have for Jürgen Klopp.Mourinho brings his team to the Amex Stadium on Friday evening for a match which is significant for both sides as we aim to secure our Premier League status and United attempt to finish the season in second place, with the added incentive of preparing for an FA Cup final against Chelsea just a couple of weeks away. Mourinho has proved himself a master of winning games in cup competitions and it’s no wonder, given his pragmatic approach to preparing for every game in a specific way.There have been a few times this season when he has been hammered for playing so-called negative football – his tactics at Liverpool were a case in point – but criticising a coach for selecting a team and forming a gameplan to counter an opponent’s strengths is like using a mallet to crack an egg.Every coach will have his own beliefs about how the game should be played and that philosophy will be borne out by the way his team carry out instructions, but it is a very narrow mind which contests that one way is definitively better than another. Like everything else in the world, football undergoes cycles and you cannot tell me the high-scoring, attacking football of this season’s Champions League is not an antidote or a reaction to the more defensive and cautious football which had been prevalent in the past 10 years or so.The foundation for change in the game is a difference in style of coaches. Mourinho is unlike Pep Guardiola or Klopp in his philosophy, but his adaptability and core values are proven to achieve success against the very best.You may remember that it was Mourinho’s Real Madrid side who won La Liga in 2011-12 against arguably the greatest club side of all time in Guardiola’s Barcelona. Real did not beat or even challenge Barça at their own game because Mourinho believed he knew how to get the better of them and they achieved that courtesy of his forensic attention to detail in preparations for a match. The modus operandi is to ensure the players are ready for the battle with their direct opponent and that they are drilled to react to any scenario – from conceding a goal to finding your team reduced to 10 men.Players who have won major trophies in Mourinho teams, such as Frank Lampard at Chelsea or Internazionale’s Marco Materazzi, have spoken about his attention to detail and how that inspires confidence in his players and while Mourinho may have a mixed persona in public, one certainty is that the majority of his players love him and would run through brick walls for him.However, it’s not that simple. Arsène Wenger has correctly been praised for revolutionising English football in the late 90s with his introduction of sports science and diet changes, among other things, at Arsenal. It seems as if he could not or would not evolve with other changes in the game, though, and that’s where the chameleon-like Mourinho may have the edge as he has incorporated the best of the rest into the running of the teams he has managed and then added his skill-set to succeed.United have come up against a phenomenal Manchester City side who are very worthy champions this season, but in the same time frame as Guardiola has been manager at the Etihad Stadium, Mourinho has won the Europa League and League Cup, and could still add an FA Cup.It is true that Guardiola’s team and the shadow of Sir Alex Ferguson have set a high bar for him but ask fans if they prefer winning to losing and I know the answer you will get.As an aspiring coach I have a firm handle on how I want my team to play and I admire and wonder at the way the likes of Guardiola, Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino have gone about their work. At the same time, I look at Mourinho and what he has won in his career by adopting a less evangelical approach to the game we all love. He has still managed to achieve great success regardless.Howard Wilkinson has been one of our tutors on the pro licence course and he is adamant that you have to survive your first 70 games as a manager if you are to have any chance of succeeding long term.Should I get the opportunity to coach one game, never mind 70, then I would be looking to combine the beautiful with the practical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05f7e37c1c1a0cbcc48d948e3eeda96554e2ebe0/0_89_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5359fc51be72aa3e230c8994d173392","title":"atletico madrid v arsenal europa league semi final second leg live","story":"Punditry from the president of Rwanda:The Atletico players are dancing on the pitch while being serenaded by their fans. Arsenal’s players have all disappeared into the dressing room. Most of them should be aware that they were found sorely wanting. The exceptions, funnily enough, were Chambers and Xhaka, and perhaps also Ramsey. There will be no happy ending for Wenger: he will leave the Emirates without having lifted a European trophy during his epic reign. And with the knowledge that Arsenal lost here because of the shortcomings he has failed to address. They played well between both boxes but could not find sharpness in Atletico’s nor protect their own consistently. The goal they conceded was as soft as the one they conceded in the first leg, and their finishing was worse: they got in promising positions but barely got off a shot. Arsenal were not good enough, then. Atletico deserve to be in the final, where they will face either Salzburg or Marseille, whose semi-final has gone to extra-time. On a further sad note for Arsenal - and France - Laurent Koscielny suffered a torn Achilles tendon and will be out of action for months. Here’s Daniel Taylor’s report on predictably drab end to Arsenal’s season.90+3 min: Atletico are finishing on the attack, Torres and Koke toying with frustrated Arsenal defenders.90 min: There will be at least three more minutes... and if Arsenal are to score, they’re going to have to produce a much better final ball than the one Monreal just produced. Once again he got into a great position and once again he ballooned his cross beyond the team-mates pleading for a good delivery. Lacazette had been starved of decent service today. Partly by Atletico’s defensive excellence, partly by Arsenal’s inability to top off decent moves with polish final passes.89 min: After Griezmann burrows his way down the left byline and into the box, he passes the ball across the face of goal. Chambers gets to it first ... and then tries to sashay out of the box past three Atletico players! He loses the ball, unsurprisingly, and Torres lets fly from eight yards. Ospina bats the ball away well. Arsenal are still alive, just!87 min: The home fans are singing, twirling their scarves and waving their flags. Apparently they are convinced that Arsenal are spent.85 min: Arsenal do reapply some pressure, pinning Atletico back in their own box and then slipping in Monreal down the left again. But Monreal’s cross is wild and flies out for a throw on the far side.84 min: Ozil gives the ball away cheaply as Arsenal threatened to reapply some pressure.Atletico substitution: Torres on, Costa off. Apparently Costa is suffering from a cramp trouble. He’s applauded off the pitch by the home fans - and Arsenal’s defenders are probably cheering too. 80 min: Do Arsenal have anything left? Atletico have cranked up the tempo and appear to be taking the game away from the visitors. They’re certainly taking the ball away from their end and playing nearer to Arsenal goal. They’re not over-committing, though, just letting Griezmann and Costa tease and bully the Arsenal defence.78 min: Freekick to Arsenal deep in their own half. Costa picks up the ball and holds on to it. Mustafi rushes over and grabs him from behind. Nothing could please Costa more. He shoves the German back and a little kerfuffle ensues. The ref rushes over and books them both.76 min: That’s better from Xhaka! An excellent and crucial sliding tackle on Griezmann in the Arsenal box.75 min: Xhaka concedes a freekick just inside his own half by walking into Costa in the manner of a man trying to spill another punter’s pint in a crowded pub.73 min: Xhaka clips a fine pass over to Monreal, who is free beyond the back post. He heads the ball across the face of goal. But, yet again, an Atletico defender is there to whack clear. 72 min: A cross by Ozil is headed out to the edge of the area. Mkhitaryan is sharp and gets to it first and then cracks off a shot from 16 yards ... which fizzes just over the bar! 70 min: Saul booked for another attack-aborting foul in midfield. He just jumped on Ramsey’s back, not even pretending to play fair. A yellow card really isn’t adequate punishment for that carry-on: the best way to close that loophole is to award a penalty for such fouls. Arsenal substitution: Mkhitaryan on, Wilshere off. That’s the right change by Wenger. 67 min: Atletico have decided they cannot just defend for the rest of the match although they probably can. They’ve shifted the play back into the Arsenal half. And they darn near increase their lead, as Costa does superbly to collect the ball in the box and turn before teeing up Griezmann, whose shot from eight yards takes a deflection off Chambers and loops up into the arms of Ospina.66 min: Salzburg have scored again. They’re 2-0 up on Marseille in the second leg, thus dead level on aggregate.64 min: The pressure from Arsenal is mounting. There’s nervousness among the home fans - and probably also among the away fans, who know that pressure from Arsenal is often the prelude to them conceding on the break.63 min: Xhaka drills in a fine low shot 20 yards. Oblak es low to his left and pushes it around the post. 62 min: Dinky play by Arsenal. They work Ozil to the byline inside the box, to the left of goal. He flashes the ball across the face but no one can reach it. Moments later Ozil gets himself into exactly the same position by winning the ball off Partey. But his low centre is cleared at the near post by Godin.61 min: According to BT, Koscileny has indeed ruptured his tendon. That the season over for him.60 min: Griezmann curls the ball over the wall but a couple of yards wide. 59 min: A strong spell of pressure from Arsenal comes to an end when Xhaka gives the ball away in midfield. Griezmann charges forward. Monreal waits until he’s at the edge of the Arsenal box before deciding to take him down. Freekick in a dangerous position ...57 min: Ramsey wins a corner on the left. Ozil delivers an outswinger. Godin heads clear. 55 min: Costa turns brilliantly past Mustafi in the box, but Chambers slides in to the rescue. Otherwise Costa would have had a free shot from nine yards. 54 min: Chance for Ramsey, eight yards out! But the ball bobbles up in front of him as several Atletico players close in. Godin (I think) pokes it off his foot before he can pull the trigger. 53 min: A cutting midfield move by Arsenal, and suddenly Welbeck is bursting forward. Gabi takes him out, impure and simple. The ref issues the inevitable booking.52 min: Xhaka scampers back 40 yards, keeping pace with Griezmann as Atletico break. Then he intercepts Costa’s attempted through-ball. Good play by the Swiss.50 min: Costa meets a corner beyond the far post and sends a header back towards goal. But it’s got no power and is easily claimed by Ospina.49 min: Arsenal’s passing is too loose in midfield. They can’t get anything going in the second half so far.46 min: No changes in personnel and no immediate change in Bellerin’s performance: within 30 seconds of the restart he overhits a routine pass, sending the ball into touch.The score in the other semi-final is Salzburg 0-0 Marseille, which equates to 0-2 on aggregate to the French side.Looking at a replay of the goal, Ospina went down way too early, making the finish simple for Costa. The bright side is that Arsenal still only need a goal to force extra-time. The dark side is that they trail because of painfully familiar failings, a lack of ruthlessness up front and a lack of solidity at the back. They had chances to take the lead but ended up allowing Atletico to do so in sadly straight-forward fashion. You could say the loss of Koscielny to a serious injury was a factor, but you’d probably be kidding yourself. Still, they could turn this around in the second half. Or are we kidding ourselves about that, too?You’ve read this story before. Arsenal coughed up possession easily in midfield and their defence was found embarrassingly exposed. Griezmann played a low ball from mid-way inside the Arsenal half to Costa, who had run clear of a dozing Bellerin. Costa carried on into the box and lifted the ball over Ospina and into the net from 12 yards.45+1 min: Koke clips in a corner. Welbeck heads it away at the near post - he’s done that several times so far, and not much else. Gabi essays a blast from long-range but it crashes into a forest of bodies. 44 min: Chambers almost gets caught by Griezmann at the edge of his own box but recovers in time to skip away from the Frenchman. Then he sends the ball froward and no doubt exhales in relief.43 min: Monreal raids down the left. He makes good ground before being crowded out by three defenders, with nary a team-mates near him. 40 min: Gabi clatters into Lacazette from behind and gets a lecture from the ref. Wilshere protests that the defender should have been booked. And moments later he gets a yellow for jumping into Gabi in a not-very-convincing attempt to win an aerial ball. Not the most sinister foul but his previous lip might have helped sway the ref. 38 min: Another setpiece leads to problems for Arsenal. Griezman ran away from Ramsey and crept behind Wilshere before collecting a freekick and shooting one the turn from a difficult angle to the right, about 10 yards out. It whizzed across goal and wide at the far post. That line about Arsenal being in the ascendancy went out of date real quick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/599064ce0d62e4ad29a4323204cda37b0bb4df96/0_744_10328_6198/master/10328.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4457f7fe8c6ffd0ce502ee6cb0bc71e","title":"how to make the perfect rhubarb crumble","story":"It’s a comfort food classic, and great for when there’s still a bit of a chill in the air, but what does it take to make it just right?If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, then crumble is comfortingly solid evidence that the best desserts aren’t delicate or even pretty: this isn’t a dish to stun social media, but it will momentarily silence the table. I can confidently say I’ve never, even in the darkest days of school dinners, met anyone who doesn’t like crumble.Of course, you can stash just about any fruit you like under that buttery, sugary topping – though as Jesse Dunford Wood notes in his book Modern British Food, not all are appropriate – but the natural astringency of rhubarb, an underrated vegetable-identifying-as-a-fruit that fills the hungry gap between autumn apples and the first summer fruits, is the perfect complement, and a time-honoured partner for a jug of custard. (Dunford Wood also has strong opinions about the correct accompaniments to the crumble. He correctly identifies custard as the ideal).When I asked for recipe recommendations for this column, someone scornfully responded, “Who uses a recipe for crumble?” They’re right: anyone can make a decent rhubarb crumble. But how do you make a perfect one?Cookery writers and chefs, including the great Jane Grigson, tend to be snooty about outdoor rhubarb – “fat and stringy monsters, mostly all green and with just the faint remembrance of pink”, as Simon Hopkinson memorably puts it in Second Helpings Of Roast Chicken – but I suspect that’s as much to do with its unremarkable looks as its flavour. The spindly, blushing-pink stalks of January and February are easy for the camera to love, while the olive trunks as thick as a terrier’s ankle are far less Instagram-friendly. They still taste great, however – and, as one of the easiest things to grow in pots that I know, deserve a bit more love from us ingrates in the food media.You’ll need to sweeten the filling somehow, but don’t go overboard: the key to success is to maintain the contrast between tangy fruit and sweet topping. The neutral sweetness of white sugar is ideal here, to allow the rhubarb to shine, but seeing as I’m using demerara in the topping, it makes sense to stick with that here, too.For some reason, rhubarb has gained a reputation as a fruit that pairs well with strawberries. I’m instinctively repulsed by the idea, but after reading in the Riverford book that “Jane used to think that cooking strawberries was an abomination, but this combination came as a very pleasant surprise”, I’m prepared to give it a whirl. Turns out it’s not just me: everyone hates it. Perhaps it’s just too early in the season, but the baked strawberries have an odd, mushy texture, and very little flavour at all. Always nice to have one’s prejudices confirmed.The apple and rhubarb combination suggested by Anna Jones in her first book, A Modern Way To Cook, proves more popular, though using them in a 1:1 ratio means the softer rhubarb has a tendency to get lost among the more solid chunks of apple. If you must mix your fruits, however, this is probably the best option.One thing that does go with rhubarb is ginger: Iyer grates fresh root into her filling, and also adds orange zest and juice, as does Jones. I like the ginger in particular, but some testers find it a bit fiery, so I’m going to leave it out, while recommending anyone who enjoys the warming heat of ginger should be brave enough to give it a try.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall recommends pairing rhubarb with sweet cicely: “As well as adding a lovely, aromatic edge to a dish, the aniseedy leaves make tart fruits seem sweeter, which means you can use less sugar.” Sadly, I don’t happen to have any in the garden, but if you do, this might also be a good option. I’m less sure about Gregg Wallace’s rhubarb and port idea, but if anyone else has time to try it, I’d love to hear your thoughts.Dunford Wood may be right in thinking that tropical fruits have no place in a crumble, but he loses some credibility with his attempts to take back control by cooking the two elements separately: “fewer soggy crumble issues and more consistency with the fruity filling, I find.” This is disappointing indeed: as Baxter’s second rule of crumble states, “Never cook the two parts separately or deconstruct the crumble in any way. This is an abomination.” (Like cooked strawberries, in fact.)Delicious as Dunford Wood’s biscuity, crunchy, honey-sweet topping is, it lacks the wonderfully soggy layer that forms as the fruit steams beneath one of the hallmarks of a proper crumble, we all agree. If you want a fancy, restaurant-style dish, by all means follow his lead, but make sure you serve it with crème anglaise, rather than besmirching the noble name of Bird’s with such foolishness. (And if you want your crumble in a hurry, Anna Jones’ super-quick pan version, which can be put together in less than 15 minutes, is an excellent version.)Many recipes add oats or ground almonds to their crumble mixtures. Both have their fans – and their downsides. Too many chewy, stodgy oats, and the topping becomes a flapjack more ground almonds than flour, and it falls apart at the first touch of the spoon (though the American website Chef Steps has a clever, flour-free version using ground almonds and egg yolks that may be of interest to coeliacs). The sweetness of almonds does go well with rhubarb, however, so I’ll be using a smaller proportion, and topping the dish with chopped almonds, an idea stolen from Jones, though I won’t be using coconut oil or sugar as she suggests. Far too exotic.Both dark and light brown sugars have their merits in this context, but we’re all smitten by the crunch of Dunford Wood’s demerara-flecked topping, even if it’s never seen a stick of rhubarb in its life. A proper school-style crumble should be satisfyingly solid, almost craggy, which requires a generous amount of butter and a splash of water to bring it together chill it before use to help it clump in the correct fashion.Iyer and Hopkinson both add ground ginger to their crumble mixture, Delia Smith sticks in cinnamon as well, Edd Kimber cardamom and Baxter crushed amaretti, but I think it’s delicious enough on its own. Serve with custard, preferably Bird’s, and preferably with a skin as thick as a rhinoceros hide, or plain ice-cream. Also delicious cold for breakfast.800g rhubarb40g demerara or white sugar 25g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped (optional)For the crumble topping150g plain flour 75g ground almonds170g chilled, unsalted butter, grated or diced75g demerara sugar¼ tsp saltHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.

By  Ben Tarnoff and  Moira WeigelBig Tech is sorry. After decades of rarely apologising for anything, Silicon Valley suddenly seems to be apologising for everything. They are sorry about the trolls. They are sorry about the bots. They are sorry about the fake news and the Russians, and the cartoons that are terrifying your kids on YouTube. But they are especially sorry about our brains.Sean Parker, the former president of Facebook – who was played by Justin Timberlake in The Social Network – has publicly lamented the “unintended consequences” of the platform he helped create: “God only knows what it’s doing to our children’s brains.” Justin Rosenstein, an engineer who helped build Facebook’s “like” button and Gchat, regrets having contributed to technology that he now considers psychologically damaging, too. “Everyone is distracted,” Rosenstein says. “All of the time.”Ever since the internet became widely used by the public in the 1990s, users have heard warnings that it is bad for us. In the early years, many commentators described cyberspace as a parallel universe that could swallow enthusiasts whole. The media fretted about kids talking to strangers and finding porn. A prominent 1998 study from Carnegie Mellon University claimed that spending time online made you lonely, depressed and antisocial.In the mid-2000s, as the internet moved on to mobile devices, physical and virtual life began to merge. Bullish pundits celebrated the “cognitive surplus” unlocked by crowdsourcing and the tech-savvy campaigns of Barack Obama, the “internet president”. But, alongside these optimistic voices, darker warnings persisted. Nicholas Carr’s The Shallows (2010) argued that search engines were making people stupid, while Eli Pariser’s The Filter Bubble (2011) claimed algorithms made us insular by showing us only what we wanted to see. In Alone, Together (2011) and Reclaiming Conversation (2015), Sherry Turkle warned that constant connectivity was making meaningful interaction impossible.Still, inside the industry, techno-utopianism prevailed. Silicon Valley seemed to assume that the tools they were building were always forces for good – and that anyone who questioned them was a crank or a luddite. In the face of an anti-tech backlash that has surged since the 2016 election, however, this faith appears to be faltering. Prominent people in the industry are beginning to acknowledge that their products may have harmful effects.Internet anxiety isn’t new. But never before have so many notable figures within the industry seemed so anxious about the world they have made. Parker, Rosenstein and the other insiders now talking about the harms of smartphones and social media belong to an informal yet influential current of tech critics emerging within Silicon Valley. You could call them the “tech humanists”. Amid rising public concern about the power of the industry, they argue that the primary problem with its products is that they threaten our health and our humanity.It is clear that these products are designed to be maximally addictive, in order to harvest as much of our attention as they can. Tech humanists say this business model is both unhealthy and inhumane – that it damages our psychological well-being and conditions us to behave in ways that diminish our humanity. The main solution that they propose is better design. By redesigning technology to be less addictive and less manipulative, they believe we can make it healthier – we can realign technology with our humanity and build products that don’t “hijack” our minds.The hub of the new tech humanism is the Center for Humane Technology in San Francisco. Founded earlier this year, the nonprofit has assembled an impressive roster of advisers, including investor Roger McNamee, Lyft president John Zimmer, and Rosenstein. But its most prominent spokesman is executive director Tristan Harris, a former “design ethicist” at Google who has been hailed by the Atlantic magazine as “the closest thing Silicon Valley has to a conscience”. Harris has spent years trying to persuade the industry of the dangers of tech addiction. In February, Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of eBay, launched a related initiative: the Tech and Society Solutions Lab, which aims to “maximise the tech industry’s contributions to a healthy society”.As suspicion of Silicon Valley grows, the tech humanists are making a bid to become tech’s loyal opposition. They are using their insider credentials to promote a particular diagnosis of where tech went wrong and of how to get it back on track. For this, they have been getting a lot of attention. As the backlash against tech has grown, so too has the appeal of techies repenting for their sins. The Center for Humane Technology has been profiled – and praised by – the New York Times, the Atlantic, Wired and others.But tech humanism’s influence cannot be measured solely by the positive media coverage it has received. The real reason tech humanism matters is because some of the most powerful people in the industry are starting to speak its idiom. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has warned about social media’s role in encouraging “mindless scrambles for friends or unworthy distractions”, and Twitter boss Jack Dorsey recently claimed he wants to improve the platform’s “conversational health”.Even Mark Zuckerberg, famous for encouraging his engineers to “move fast and break things”, seems to be taking a tech humanist turn. In January, he announced that Facebook had a new priority: maximising “time well spent” on the platform, rather than total time spent. By “time well spent”, Zuckerberg means time spent interacting with “friends” rather than businesses, brands or media sources. He said the News Feed algorithm was already prioritising these “more meaningful” activities.Zuckerberg’s choice of words is significant: Time Well Spent is the name of the advocacy group that Harris led before co-founding the Center for Humane Technology. In April, Zuckerberg brought the phrase to Capitol Hill. When a photographer snapped a picture of the notes Zuckerberg used while testifying before the Senate, they included a discussion of Facebook’s new emphasis on “time well spent”, under the heading “wellbeing”.This new concern for “wellbeing” may strike some observers as a welcome development. After years of ignoring their critics, industry leaders are finally acknowledging that problems exist. Tech humanists deserve credit for drawing attention to one of those problems – the manipulative design decisions made by Silicon Valley.But these decisions are only symptoms of a larger issue: the fact that the digital infrastructures that increasingly shape our personal, social and civic lives are owned and controlled by a few billionaires. Because it ignores the question of power, the tech-humanist diagnosis is incomplete – and could even help the industry evade meaningful reform. Taken up by leaders such as Zuckerberg, tech humanism is likely to result in only superficial changes. These changes may soothe some of the popular anger directed towards the tech industry, but they will not address the origin of that anger. If anything, they will make Silicon Valley even more powerful.The Center for Humane Technology argues that technology must be “aligned” with humanity – and that the best way to accomplish this is through better design. Their website features a section entitled The Way Forward. A familiar evolutionary image shows the silhouettes of several simians, rising from their crouches to become a man, who then turns back to contemplate his history.“In the future, we will look back at today as a turning point towards humane design,” the header reads. To the litany of problems caused by “technology that extracts attention and erodes society”, the text asserts that “humane design is the solution”. Drawing on the rhetoric of the “design thinking” philosophy that has long suffused Silicon Valley, the website explains that humane design “starts by understanding our most vulnerable human instincts so we can design compassionately”.There is a good reason why the language of tech humanism is penetrating the upper echelons of the tech industry so easily: this language is not foreign to Silicon Valley. On the contrary, “humanising” technology has long been its central ambition and the source of its power. It was precisely by developing a “humanised” form of computing that entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs brought computing into millions of users’ everyday lives. Their success turned the Bay Area tech industry into a global powerhouse – and produced the digitised world that today’s tech humanists now lament.The story begins in the 1960s, when Silicon Valley was still a handful of electronics firms clustered among fruit orchards. Computers came in the form of mainframes then. These machines were big, expensive and difficult to use. Only corporations, universities and government agencies could afford them, and they were reserved for specialised tasks, such as calculating missile trajectories or credit scores.Computing was industrial, in other words, not personal, and Silicon Valley remained dependent on a small number of big institutional clients. The practical danger that this dependency posed became clear in the early 1960s, when the US Department of Defense, by far the single biggest buyer of digital components, began cutting back on its purchases. But the fall in military procurement wasn’t the only mid-century crisis around computing.Computers also had an image problem. The inaccessibility of mainframes made them easy to demonise. In these whirring hulks of digital machinery, many observers saw something inhuman, even evil. To antiwar activists, computers were weapons of the war machine that was killing thousands in Vietnam. To highbrow commentators such as the social critic Lewis Mumford, computers were instruments of a creeping technocracy that threatened to extinguish personal freedom.But during the course of the 1960s and 70s, a series of experiments in northern California helped solve both problems. These experiments yielded breakthrough innovations like the graphical user interface, the mouse and the microprocessor. Computers became smaller, more usable and more interactive, reducing Silicon Valley’s reliance on a few large customers while giving digital technology a friendlier face.The pioneers who led this transformation believed they were making computing more human. They drew deeply from the counterculture of the period, and its fixation on developing “human” modes of living. They wanted their machines to be “extensions of man”, in the words of Marshall McLuhan, and to unlock “human potential” rather than repress it. At the centre of this ecosystem of hobbyists, hackers, hippies and professional engineers was Stewart Brand, famed entrepreneur of the counterculture and founder of the Whole Earth Catalog. In a famous 1972 article for Rolling Stone, Brand called for a new model of computing that “served human interest, not machine”.Brand’s disciples answered this call by developing the technical innovations that transformed computers into the form we recognise today. They also promoted a new way of thinking about computers – not as impersonal slabs of machinery, but as tools for unleashing “human potential”.No single figure contributed more to this transformation of computing than Steve Jobs, who was a fan of Brand and a reader of the Whole Earth Catalog. Jobs fulfilled Brand’s vision on a global scale, launching the mass personal computing era with the Macintosh in the mid-80s, and the mass smartphone era with the iPhone two decades later. Brand later acknowledged that Jobs embodied the Whole Earth Catalog ethos. “He got the notion of tools for human use,” Brand told Jobs’ biographer, Walter Isaacson.Building those “tools for human use” turned out to be great for business. The impulse to humanise computing enabled Silicon Valley to enter every crevice of our lives. From phones to tablets to laptops, we are surrounded by devices that have fulfilled the demands of the counterculture for digital connectivity, interactivity and self-expression. Your iPhone responds to the slightest touch you can look at photos of anyone you have ever known, and broadcast anything you want to all of them, at any moment.In short, the effort to humanise computing produced the very situation that the tech humanists now consider dehumanising: a wilderness of screens where digital devices chase every last instant of our attention. To guide us out of that wilderness, tech humanists say we need more humanising. They believe we can use better design to make technology serve human nature rather than exploit and corrupt it. But this idea is drawn from the same tradition that created the world that tech humanists believe is distracting and damaging us.Tech humanists say they want to align humanity and technology. But this project is based on a deep misunderstanding of the relationship between humanity and technology: namely, the fantasy that these two entities could ever exist in separation.It is difficult to imagine human beings without technology. The story of our species began when we began to make tools. Homo habilis, the first members of our genus, left sharpened stones scattered across Africa. Their successors hit rocks against each other to make sparks, and thus fire. With fire you could cook meat and clear land for planting with ash you could fertilise the soil with smoke you could make signals. In flickering light, our ancestors painted animals on cave walls. The ancient tragedian Aeschylus recalled this era mythically: Prometheus, in stealing fire from the gods, “founded all the arts of men.”All of which is to say: humanity and technology are not only entangled, they constantly change together. This is not just a metaphor. Recent research suggests that the human hand evolved to manipulate the stone tools that our ancestors used. The evolutionary scientist Mary Marzke shows that we developed “a unique pattern of muscle architecture and joint surface form and functions” for this purpose.The ways our bodies and brains change in conjunction with the tools we make have long inspired anxieties that “we” are losing some essential qualities. For millennia, people have feared that new media were eroding the very powers that they promised to extend. In The Phaedrus, Socrates warned that writing on wax tablets would make people forgetful. If you could jot something down, you wouldn’t have to remember it. In the late middle ages, as a culture of copying manuscripts gave way to printed books, teachers warned that pupils would become careless, since they no longer had to transcribe what their teachers said.Yet as we lose certain capacities, we gain new ones. People who used to navigate the seas by following stars can now program computers to steer container ships from afar. Your grandmother probably has better handwriting than you do – but you probably type faster.The nature of human nature is that it changes. It can not, therefore, serve as a stable basis for evaluating the impact of technology. Yet the assumption that it doesn’t change serves a useful purpose. Treating human nature as something static, pure and essential elevates the speaker into a position of power. Claiming to tell us who we are, they tell us how we should be.Intentionally or not, this is what tech humanists are doing when they talk about technology as threatening human nature – as if human nature had stayed the same from the paleolithic era until the rollout of the iPhone. Holding humanity and technology separate clears the way for a small group of humans to determine the proper alignment between them. And while the tech humanists may believe they are acting in the common good, they themselves acknowledge they are doing so from above, as elites. “We have a moral responsibility to steer people’s thoughts ethically,” Tristan Harris has declared.Harris and his fellow tech humanists also frequently invoke the language of public health. The Center for Humane Technology’s Roger McNamee has gone so far as to call public health “the root of the whole thing”, and Harris has compared using Snapchat to smoking cigarettes. The public-health framing casts the tech humanists in a paternalistic role. Resolving a public health crisis requires public health expertise. It also precludes the possibility of democratic debate. You don’t put the question of how to treat a disease up for a vote – you call a doctor.This paternalism produces a central irony of tech humanism: the language that they use to describe users is often dehumanising. “Facebook appeals to your lizard brain – primarily fear and anger,” says McNamee. Harris echoes this sentiment: “Imagine you had an input cable,” he has said. “You’re trying to jack it into a human being. Do you want to jack it into their reptilian brain, or do you want to jack it into their more reflective self?”The Center for Humane Technology’s website offers tips on how to build a more reflective and less reptilian relationship to your smartphone: “going greyscale” by setting your screen to black-and-white, turning off app notifications and charging your device outside your bedroom. It has also announced two major initiatives: a national campaign to raise awareness about technology’s harmful effects on young people’s “digital health and well-being” and a “Ledger of Harms” – a website that will compile information about the health effects of different technologies in order to guide engineers in building “healthier” products.These initiatives may help some people reduce their smartphone use – a reasonable personal goal. But there are some humans who may not share this goal, and there need not be anything unhealthy about that. Many people rely on the internet for solace and solidarity, especially those who feel marginalised. The kid with autism may stare at his screen when surrounded by people, because it lets him tolerate being surrounded by people. For him, constant use of technology may not be destructive at all, but in fact life-saving.Pathologising certain potentially beneficial behaviours as “sick” isn’t the only problem with the Center for Humane Technology’s proposals. They also remain confined to the personal level, aiming to redesign how the inidual user interacts with technology rather than tackling the industry’s structural failures. Tech humanism fails to address the root cause of the tech backlash: the fact that a small handful of corporations own our digital lives and strip-mine them for profit. This is a fundamentally political and collective issue. But by framing the problem in terms of health and humanity, and the solution in terms of design, the tech humanists personalise and depoliticise it.This may be why their approach is so appealing to the tech industry. There is no reason to doubt the good intentions of tech humanists, who may genuinely want to address the problems fuelling the tech backlash. But they are handing the firms that caused those problems a valuable weapon. Far from challenging Silicon Valley, tech humanism offers Silicon Valley a useful way to pacify public concerns without surrendering any of its enormous wealth and power. By channelling popular anger at Big Tech into concerns about health and humanity, tech humanism gives corporate giants such as Facebook a way to avoid real democratic control. In a moment of danger, it may even help them protect their profits.One can easily imagine a version of Facebook that embraces the principles of tech humanism while remaining a profitable and powerful monopoly. In fact, these principles could make Facebook even more profitable and powerful, by opening up new business opportunities. That seems to be exactly what Facebook has planned.Zuckerberg said he expected those changes would continue to decrease total time spent – but “the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable”. This may describe what users find valuable – but it also refers to what Facebook finds valuable. In a recent interview, he said: “Over the long term, even if time spent goes down, if people are spending more time on Facebook actually building relationships with people they care about, then that’s going to build a stronger community and build a stronger business, regardless of what Wall Street thinks about it in the near term.”Sheryl Sandberg has also stressed that the shift will create “more monetisation opportunities”. How? Everyone knows data is the lifeblood of Facebook – but not all data is created equal. One of the most valuable sources of data to Facebook is used to inform a metric called “coefficient”. This measures the strength of a connection between two users – Zuckerberg once called it “an index for each relationship”. Facebook records every interaction you have with another user – from liking a friend’s post or viewing their profile, to sending them a message. These activities provide Facebook with a sense of how close you are to another person, and different activities are weighted differently. Messaging, for instance, is considered the strongest signal. It’s reasonable to assume that you’re closer to somebody you exchange messages with than somebody whose post you once liked.Why is coefficient so valuable? Because Facebook uses it to create a Facebook they think you will like: it guides algorithmic decisions about what content you see and the order in which you see it. It also helps improve ad targeting, by showing you ads for things liked by friends with whom you often interact. Advertisers can target the closest friends of the users who already like a product, on the assumption that close friends tend to like the same things.So when Zuckerberg talks about wanting to increase “meaningful” interactions and building relationships, he is not succumbing to pressure to take better care of his users. Rather, emphasising time well spent means creating a Facebook that prioritises data-rich personal interactions that Facebook can use to make a more engaging platform. Rather than spending a lot of time doing things that Facebook doesn’t find valuable – such as watching viral videos – you can spend a bit less time, but spend it doing things that Facebook does find valuable.In other words, “time well spent” means Facebook can monetise more efficiently. It can prioritise the intensity of data extraction over its extensiveness. This is a wise business move, disguised as a concession to critics. Shifting to this model not only sidesteps concerns about tech addiction – it also acknowledges certain basic limits to Facebook’s current growth model. There are only so many hours in the day. Facebook can’t keep prioritising total time spent – it has to extract more value from less time.In many ways, this process recalls an earlier stage in the evolution of capitalism. In the 19th century, factory owners in England discovered they could only make so much money by extending the length of the working day. At some point, workers would die of exhaustion, or they would revolt, or they would push parliament to pass laws that limited their working hours. So industrialists had to find ways to make the time of the worker more valuable – to extract more money from each moment rather than adding more moments. They did this by making industrial production more efficient: developing new technologies and techniques that squeezed more value out of the worker and stretched that value further than ever before.A similar situation confronts Facebook today. They have to make the attention of the user more valuable – and the language and concepts of tech humanism can help them do it. So far, it seems to be working. Despite the reported drop in total time spent, Facebook recently announced huge 2018 Q1 earnings of $11.97bn (£8.7bn), smashing Wall Street estimates by nearly $600m.Today’s tech humanists come from a tradition with deep roots in Silicon Valley. Like their predecessors, they believe that technology and humanity are distinct, but can be harmonised. This belief guided the generations who built the “humanised” machines that became the basis for the industry’s enormous power. Today it may provide Silicon Valley with a way to protect that power from a growing public backlash – and even deepen it by uncovering new opportunities for profit-making.Fortunately, there is another way of thinking about how to live with technology – one that is both truer to the history of our species and useful for building a more democratic future. This tradition does not address “humanity” in the abstract, but as distinct human beings, whose capacities are shaped by the tools they use. It sees us as hybrids of animal and machine – as “cyborgs”, to quote the biologist and philosopher of science Donna Haraway.To say that we’re all cyborgs is not to say that all technologies are good for us, or that we should embrace every new invention. But it does suggest that living well with technology can’t be a matter of making technology more “human”. This goal isn’t just impossible – it’s also dangerous, because it puts us at the mercy of experts who tell us how to be human. It cedes control of our technological future to those who believe they know what’s best for us because they understand the essential truths about our species.The cyborg way of thinking, by contrast, tells us that our species is essentially technological. We change as we change our tools, and our tools change us. But even though our continuous co-evolution with our machines is inevitable, the way it unfolds is not. Rather, it is determined by who owns and runs those machines. It is a question of power.Today, that power is wielded by corporations, which own our technology and run it for profit. The various scandals that have stoked the tech backlash all share a single source. Surveillance, fake news and the miserable working conditions in Amazon’s warehouses are profitable. If they were not, they would not exist. They are symptoms of a profound democratic deficit inflicted by a system that prioritises the wealth of the few over the needs and desires of the many.There is an alternative. If being technological is a feature of being human, then the power to shape how we live with technology should be a fundamental human right. The decisions that most affect our technological lives are far too important to be left to Mark Zuckerberg, rich investors or a handful of “humane designers”. They should be made by everyone, together.Rather than trying to humanise technology, then, we should be trying to democratise it. We should be demanding that society as a whole gets to decide how we live with technology – rather than the small group of people who have captured society’s wealth.What does this mean in practice? First, it requires limiting and eroding Silicon Valley’s power. Antitrust laws and tax policy offer useful ways to claw back the fortunes Big Tech has built on common resources. After all, Silicon Valley wouldn’t exist without billions of dollars of public funding, not to mention the vast quantities of information that we all provide for free. Facebook’s market capitalisation is $500bn with 2.2 billion users – do the math to estimate how much the time you spend on Facebook is worth. You could apply the same logic to Google. There is no escape: whether or not you have an account, both platforms track you around the internet.In addition to taxing and shrinking tech firms, democratic governments should be making rules about how those firms are allowed to behave – rules that restrict how they can collect and use our personal data, for instance, like the General Data Protection Regulation coming into effect in the European Union later this month. But more robust regulation of Silicon Valley isn’t enough. We also need to pry the ownership of our digital infrastructure away from private firms.This means developing publicly and co-operatively owned alternatives that empower workers, users and citizens to determine how they are run. These democratic digital structures can focus on serving personal and social needs rather than piling up profits for investors. One inspiring example is municipal broadband: a successful experiment in Chattanooga, Tennessee, has shown that publicly owned internet service providers can supply better service at lower cost than private firms. Other models of digital democracy might include a worker-owned Uber, a user-owned Facebook or a socially owned “smart city” of the kind being developed in Barcelona. Alternatively, we might demand that tech firms pay for the privilege of extracting our data, so that we can collectively benefit from a resource we collectively create.More experimentation is needed, but democracy should be our guiding principle. The stakes are high. Never before have so many people been thinking about the problems produced by the tech industry and how to solve them. The tech backlash is an enormous opportunity – and one that may not come again for a long time.The old techno-utopianism is crumbling. What will replace it? Silicon Valley says it wants to make the world a better place. Fulfilling this promise may require a new kind of disruption.Main illustration by Lee Martin Design• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f95bf9d57d22ffecbc9b90994a61e80a6d75e98/0_0_3500_2427/master/3500.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ff8fa667b1b7cf77f9bba3666bd927a 880w","title":"local election officials wrongly turn away eu citizens in tower hamlets","story":"People marked out as European nationals in London borough initially told they cannot voteEU citizens have been wrongly told they could not vote in England’s local elections, raising fears about future training of public service officials in relation to European nationals’ post-Brexit rights.Romain Sauron, a French national, said he turned up to vote at the Mile End ward in the London borough of Tower Hamlets to find a “G” alongside his name. The officials at the polling station told him this marked him out as an EU citizen and meant he could not vote.“They were quite difficult. I have been here for 13 years and always voted, but I had to haggle with them for about 10 minutes. They checked their leaflet and told me: ‘No, you can’t vote’. I suspect they didn’t read it properly and their training was very poor. They then made a phone call to someone and after 10 minutes they said ‘that’s fine, you can vote’,” Sauron said. “I was tagged as an EU citizen. I think many people would have walked away, would have felt ashamed.”Another EU citizen, also voting in Tower Hamlets, had a similar experience. Dragos Serban, a Romanian who has lived in the UK for eight years, said: “I made my way to my designated polling station and as expected they asked for my name and address.“On their checklist, the letter G was next to my name and I was shown a leaflet which said that G means ‘certain EU citizens cannot vote’.“I was then asked to wait a few minutes while they made a call to double check my eligibility to vote. When they came back, they said that the leaflet was in regards to the general election and does not apply to today’s local one. Once that has been cleared up, they were happy to cross my name off their checklist and was allowed to proceed with the vote.”Serban added: “While my experience has been positive, I am left wondering just how many EU citizens are in the same situation and have left the polling station without exercising their voting rights.”A Tower Hamlets spokesman said: “We’ve not had reports of people being turned away across the borough but anyone with concerns should report them to this address: www.towerhamlets.gov.ukelectoralfraud or @towerhamletsnow.”EU citizens, with the exception of Irish citizens, are not entitled to vote in general elections. However they are allowed to vote in local and European elections. On social media, many EU citizens expressed sadness that this year may be the last time they will be able to vote in the country in which they live. One, Anna Brostromer, said only a miracle could save her right to vote after 23 years in the country. Another EU citizen, in the country for 34 years, wrote that after Thursday’s elections he felt “devalued” and a “commodity” who just earns and pays taxes.“My foreign name will become a wall, my badge of difference, a reason for someone to say, ‘You have no right to be here’.”British citizens in Europe will also lose the right to vote in local elections and European elections and some, who have been out of the country for more than 15 years, will not be allowed to vote in British general elections either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de631381d0503d6878d299f779eed7bbfeac1f3a/0_457_4520_2713/master/4520.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58eed06c0702c8bc44d22ca80b126df2","title":"post brexit port checks could disrupt fresh food supplies say freight bosses","story":"Safety inspections on foods such as tomatoes and beef seen as bigger issue than customs checksFood staples including lettuce, tomatoes and beef could be in short supply or even disappear from supermarket shelves after Brexit because of disruptive checks that will need to be conducted at ports, Eurotunnel and freight industry chiefs have said.Scores of continental favourites that currently sail and rail through the French border – including oranges, lemons and avocados from Spain and fresh flowers from Holland – will be subject to phytosanitary checks in addition to customs checks after Brexit. “Controls can take a few minutes to 48 hours if a laboratory test needs to be done,” John Keefe, the director of public affairs at Getlink, the new name for Eurotunnel Group, told the annual Multimodal logistics conference in Birmingham.“Coming in through the Channel tunnel on an everyday basis are food, flowers … If the government turn round at the end of Brexit negotiations and say: ‘Sorry consumers, you will no longer be able to have fresh strawberries or fresh lettuce or fruits de mer from France, there is likely to be a strong reaction from consumers. If we go backwards from frictionless border, then we really have lost from Brexit.”There will also have to be checks in Calais and other continental ports for British exports, meaning French diners may have to do without Scottish salmon or langoustines. Supplies of such foods from Scotland rotted on the roadside in 2015, the last time there were major delays in the ports.Keefe said the phytosanitary checks legally required on both sides of the border were a bigger challenge than the high-profile issue of customs checks that is currently iding the cabinet.“If we are all happy eating frozen meat then it’s an easy win, but if we want fresh food and having it on our shelves 365 days a year then it’s a big problem,” he said. “We export about £8bn of fresh produce a year and import £12-13bn. That amount of fresh produce going backwards and forwards is far more of a risk for the government than is anything of customs or duty.” Keefe said one problem was there were no existing border inspection posts to serve Folkestone and Dover, the gateway for the majority of fresh food supplies. It is estimated it could take between five and 10 years to put enough posts in place to deal with the volume of freight requiring phytosanitary inspection.Keefe called on the government to urgently draw up a plan of action, as he said it was estimated it could take “anything between five and 10 years to build border inspection posts to deal with the level of traffic coming across a short strait”.Representatives from the Dover Port and the Freight Transport Association had the same message. “It is the non-tariff barriers that could cause the bulk of delay,” said James Hookham, the deputy chief executive of the FTA.Pauline Bastidon, the association’s head of European policy, told the conference: “Everything needs to be checked – animal products, animal feed, fruit and veg, raw meat, but also things like pot noodles and readymade meals with a little bit of meat.”There are border inspection posts at ports and airports that are hubs for non-EU goods, such as Heathrow, Felixstowe and the Thames Gateway, but none in Dover or Folkestone.The phytosanitary checks are a critical part of infection control to protect animals and the public and help stop the spread of everything from mad cow disease to Dutch elm disease.They are also a vital weapon in the battle against cases of food fraud like the horsemeat scandal in 2013, when beef burgers sold in several Irish and British supermarkets were found to contain mixed meat.The UK is not self-sufficient in food and relies on imports, an issue that farmers and food producers have said could lead to shortages of staples after Brexit. Richard Christian, the policy director at Dover, said delays from checks could lead to miles-long tailbacks at the port and in Calais. “We are open 364 days a year to keep the goods in the shops that we all enjoy. The second we stop that flow, that’s where we’ve got this problem,” he said. “The amount of time to process non-EU freight – on a good day it can take 20 minutes, it can take several hours, on a bad day it can take several days. Somehow we’ve got to get a few hours down to two minutes otherwise there will be a perpetual queue of 17 miles.”Several executives at the conference poured cold water on the government’s current proposed solution for the borders. Peter MacSwiney, the chair of Agency Sector Management, a freight specialist, described the proposed customs partnership as “ridiculous” as it would require French, Belgian and Dutch authorities to reciprocate. “Why would they invest in developing new IT systems to match ours when it was the UK that voted for Brexit, not them?” he said.A Defra spokeswoman said its priority was “to maintain environmental, welfare and biosecurity standards in a way that supports trade and the smooth flow of goods”. She said the department was “considering our import controls for a range of scenarios to make sure we are ready for when we leave the EU”.

In the other two test areas, Swindon and Watford, only a polling card was required.In Bromley, south-east London, tallies by the opposition Labour group found at least 13 people turned away from just one ward, Crystal Palace. There were also reports of some voters being angry and abusive to polling station workers when asked to show ID.One reported instance involved a long-time voting clerk having to turn away a man he knows personally as the would-be voter did not have the necessary documents.In Woking there was some confusion reported as to what ID could be shown, with one man saying he was initially told a photo rail pass was not allowed, even though it was listed among the accepted documents.The scheme has prompted concerns from charities and others that it could disenfranchise more vulnerable voters who are less likely to have access to the necessary ID, for example, older people and those who are homeless.Angela Wilkins, the leader of the Labour group on Bromley council, said she was concerned that the bulk of reports about people being turned away seemed to be from Crystal Palace, the most deprived and erse part of the borough.“We assume tallies are being taken about how many people are refused at each polling station, and if it turns out this is a particular problem in places like Crystal Palace it bears out some of the concerns we have raised,” she said.However, Stuart Wilks-Heeg, a visiting fellow at the University of Manchester who is an expert on electoral integrity, said his observations at three polling stations in Woking, where two people were turned away, seemed to show the pilot was running fairly smoothly.“Polling station staff were really well briefed and voters clearly knew about the requirements,” he said.Later observations in Swindon, where people had a bar code on their polling cards scanned before voting, saw few problems, Wilks-Heeg said, though police were reportedly called when one man became irate at being asked to show his card.In Bromley, most voters said they had few problems with the idea. A 92-year-old woman at a polling station in Penge, who gave her name as Florence, said it had been no concern to show photo ID for the first time in 70-plus years of voting.“I don’t care at all,” she said. “If you’ve got nothing to hide it shouldn’t be a problem.”The Cabinet Office argues that it is necessary to prevent voter impersonation and voter ID has been recommended by the Electoral Commission.But critics have said it is an overreaction to a marginal problem, with none of the five trial boroughs having reported a single incident of voter impersonation – known technically as personation – over the past decade.Cat Smith, shadow minister for voter engagement, said: “There was absolutely no case for introducing voter ID in the first place but after Thursday’s fiasco, it is impossible for the government to justify rolling it out.“After completely ignoring a number of serious warning signs, the government decided to pilot discriminatory measures which denied people their right to vote.” A spokesman for the prime minister, asked about reports of some voters being turned away, said: “The overwhelming number of people are casting their vote without a problem. “A great deal of work has been done in these pilot areas to prepare the public there. In places like Bromley, people will have had six pieces of direct mail about the pilot, and there has been a widespread poster campaign.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc84cf2c4b4cd512659f4c4192bf9c9febf4ead5/0_0_4740_2844/master/4740.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91304ab07661145755756ce36ae583d7","title":"teachers to be offered years paid sabbatical to improve retention","story":"Education secretary Damian Hinds to unveil £5m scheme in address to school leaders in Liverpool on FridayTeachers are to be offered up to a year’s paid sabbatical, in a bid to improve retention rates in the profession.In an address on Friday to more than 350 school leaders in Liverpool, education secretary Damian Hinds will announce the £5m scheme.He will say the goal is to make sure teaching remains “an attractive, fulfilling profession” in the speech at the National Association of Head Teachers’ (NAHT) annual conference.The pilot scheme would allow teachers to take between a term and a year away from the classroom if they can prove that it will benefit their teaching. Ideas for what teachers could choose to do with the time include studying or spending a year working in an industry relevant to their field.Only teachers with 10 years’ experience would be eligible to apply for the sabbatical, which a spokesman for the Department for Education (DfE) said was intended to help reward long service in the profession.The sabbatical scheme will form part of a package of measures designed to introducing more flexible working practices into the profession, which has been slow to implement part-time work and job shares. The proposals would put teaching on par with other industries, the DfE said. Hinds will also announce a range of other proposals: “We will be introducing an enhanced offer of support for new teachers – including extending the induction period to two years – and we will work with the profession to develop a new early career content framework that will set out all the training and mentoring a teacher is entitled to in those first years.”He will also say that he wants to develop “clearer career pathways” and make schools “attractive 21st century workplaces”.The proposals were welcomed by NAHT general secretary, Paul Whiteman. “We have a track record of working with the government on improvements to the system and we look forward to working with them to help define the detail behind these new proposals and to make sure that these joint ambitions are realised,” said Whiteman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6db80de2b266fbe1b03b2c9ae9a822a64f183ea/0_176_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=171d2828816d845dadd7f81aea63df36","title":"local elections council england 2018 tories labour corbyn may","story":"Parties face their biggest ballot box test since the general election with council seats and mayoralties up for grabs across England. Follow all the results as they come in liveAccording to the Press Association, results are now in from six councils.The council that has changed hands is Nuneaton \u0026amp Bedworth, which has gone from Labour to no overall control (NOC).More on what the Tories are saying.Lib Dem sources say the party expects to make a handful of gains in Liverpool. This is from my colleague Pippa Crerar.Senior Labour and Conservative sources in Dudley, where either party could take control, say it is too close to call, the Press Association is reporting. Labour sources say it could come down to results in just two of the 24 wards being contested, Belle Vale and Wollaston \u0026amp Stourbridge Town.The Press Association has posted the first full council result of the night.The Tories are saying Labour has lost control of Nuneaton. And the party has tweeted this particular result.On the BBC John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says it is going to be “a complicated night”. It might be “quite boring” too, he says - to protests from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg. He says suggestions that Labour could make great gains were wrong. Relatively few councils are likely to change hands, he says. And he says it is not clear what will happen to the Ukip vote. He says at the general election two thirds of the Ukip vote went to the Conservatives, and only one third went to Labour. He says Labour’s focus is on making “incremental gains”.The Conservatives are doing well in Nuneaton, the BBC is reporting. Britain Elects has two of the ward results.Conservatives in Welwyn Hatfield could lose overall control, party sources have told the Press Association.These are from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.We’ve also got a byelection tonight in Northern Ireland. It was triggered by the decision of Sinn Fein’s Barry McElduff to resign as West Tyrone MP in January, 10 days after he provoked outrage by posting a video of himself with a Kingsmill-branded loaf on his head on the anniversary of the notorious Kingsmill massacre. McElduff had a majority of more than 10,000 and his Sinn Fein successor Orfhlaith Begley is expected to win.This is intriguing, from the BBC Essex reporter Charlotte Rose.It is hard to measure success in local elections because the seats and the councils where elections take place are not the same every year and therefore - as John Curtice pointed out in the briefing cited earlier (see 10.31pm) - the raw results can be misleading.But parties and their supporters will want to know who is doing well and who is doing badly. Here are three measures you can use, with the relevant benchmarks.After the local elections psephologists look at the vote share the parties achieve and use those figures to calculate what the vote share would have been if people had been voting in the same way across the whole of Britain. They do this by looking at the demographic make-up of the wards where people were voting and extrapolating a national figure, based on what is known about voting behaviour.Just to make things complicated, there are two versions of this figure. Curtice and his team produce one called the projected national share (PNS) which the BBC uses. And two other psephologists, Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher produce one they call the national equivalent vote (NEV), which gets used by Sky. They tend to show the same trend, but the actual figures are not always the same.At some point on Friday we will get PNS and NEV figures for these elections. There are at least three figures you can compare them to.Vote share at the 2017 general election (for GB)Vote share at 2017 local elections Vote share at 2014 local elections (when these seats last fought)As Curtice explained (see 10.31pm), comparing seats gained and lost in one year with the seats gained and lost in another can be grossly misleading, because different numbers of council seats are up for election every year. The only comparison that is remotely half-fair is with what happened in 2014 - when most of these seats were last up for election - although even that is problematic, because the exact number of seats being contested is not the same.Council seats wonlost in 2014Another factor, obviously, if that Labour gained a lot of seats in these councils four years ago, it becomes much harder to gain more.The same point applies to comparing the number of councils gainedlost with the figures for 2014. But, for what they are worth, here are the figures for that year.Con: Net loss of 13 councilsLab: Net gain of 4LD: Net loss of 2No overall control: Net increase of 11More from Swindon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91df1cd4351136126dfe9337d2ad0b963448b009/0_44_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a83319ea5632cd89c90221612ac8854","title":"local elections 2018 polling day live","story":"The polls are closed and with that goes this blog. Thanks so much for joining us throughout the day, and thank you for all the comments. Please join my colleague Andrew Sparrow, who will be blogging the election results as they come in throughout the night. In the meantime, here’s a quick roundup of today’s action:Here’s the fresh blog: Journalists in Sutton are in for a treat tonight with this “media suite”.Election day chips, anyone?EU citizens have been wrongly told they could not vote in England’s local elections, raising fears about future training of public service officials in relation to European nationals’ post-Brexit rights.Romain Sauron, a French national, said he turned up to vote at the Mile End ward in the London borough of Tower Hamlets to find a “G” alongside his name.The officials at the polling station told him this marked him out as an EU citizen and meant he could not vote.“They were quite difficult. I have been here for 13 years and always voted, but I had to haggle with them for about 10 minutes. They checked their leaflet and told me: ‘No, you can’t vote’. I suspect they didn’t read it properly and their training was very poor. They then made a phone call to someone and after 10 minutes they said ‘that’s fine, you can vote’,” Sauron said.“I was tagged as an EU citizen. I think many people would have walked away, would have felt ashamed.”Read the full story here:Controversial voter ID pilot trials are causing a “hugely unnecessary barrier” to people trying to exercise their democratic rights, a Labour MP said.Ellie Reeves, MP for Lewisham West and Penge, said: I’ve had reports throughout the day of queues at polling stations. It’s a much longer process than normal. You have people leaving the queues to get to work or pick up kids from school. I do think it’s put a hugely unnecessary barrier up to people wanting to vote. Compare that to the fact there was only one conviction for electoral fraud based on impersonation in 2017, it just seems like it’s using a sledgehammer to crack a nut in terms of what it’s going to achieve. Bromley is a fairly affluent, well-settled community. But if you have this in places where the population is much more transient, where there’s a much higher ethnic minority population... it could have an incredibly detrimental effect on people being able to vote if it’s rolled out across the country.If you’re wondering when the results will start coming in, here’s our definitive guide. It includes all the boroughs to watch out for if you are planning to stay up all night. Screenshots of an email sent out by Conservative campaign headquarters are being shared on Twitter and nobody is impressed with the contents. John Stevens from the Daily Mail called it a “new low”.Others were more blunt.An EU citizen was almost turned away at a polling station today, according to an email sent to my colleague Lisa O’Carroll. The law is clear that EU citizens living in the UK are eligible to vote in local elections.Please get in touch if you have had a similar experience today.Many of you seem to be questioning whether voting offences are a problem that need rectifying. Here’s what CherryHill had to say after reading the Electoral Commission’s electoral fraud analysis from 2017:Let\u0027s get this in context, there were only 104 cases of alleged electoral fraud involving voting offences in the UK in 2017. Download pdf here:Of these, 28 concerned personation (voting as someone else) at a polling station, 22 using a postal vote and 13 using a proxy vote.In the majority of the 104 cases (74) police took no further action.In 22 cases this was because it was clear that no offence had been committed, while in four cases the police identified that the alleged offence did not involve electoral fraud. In 23 cases the police found insufficient evidence to conclude their investigation, in 24 cases it was not possible to identify a suspect and in a further 4 cases it was found not to be a RPA offence. In the remaining case the police did not record the reason for no further action. You win some, you lose some...Many EU citizens will be voting for the last time in Britain today. Some have been tweeting about their experience.Canvassers are out in force today for the final push to get people to the polling booths.Momentum, the Labour-supporting grassroots movement, are today holding unseat events in Westminster, Barnet, Wandsworth, Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea, Swindon and Trafford. They say thousands of people attended their 15 unseat events over the course of the local election campaign. The biggest was in Wandsworth, which drew 300 people.Police have said a man was reportedly carrying a gun at a polling station in Northern Ireland. Nobody was threatened at the venue and it is understood detectives are following a definite line of enquiry and trying to locate him.Voters in West Tyrone have gone to the polls for a Westminster by-election caused by the resignation of former MP Barry McElduff. Police in Omagh received the report of a man acting suspiciously at a polling station on the Crockanboy Road, Greencastle, just before 1pm today. Ulster Unionist West Tyrone Westminster candidate Chris Smyth said there was now a strong, armed police presence at the scene.As a counter-balance to the popular #dogsatpollingstations hashtag, people have been posting about other things at polling stations, including penguins.Disappointingly, it’s not a real penguin, just this Pingu furniture at the school where the vote is being held. The Electoral Reform Society might surely consider though the suggestion that turn-out could be improved if we got to post our votes into a big fibreglass penguin rather than a boring old ballot box.The unofficial account of Whitehall’s FCO cat Palmerston clarified why we see dogs at polling stations but not cats.Political commentator Jane Merrick tried to get the rather more inanimate #plantsatpollingstations going when voting at a rather picturesque polling station, without much success.On social media, of course, you are never far away from a pun on a popular hashtag.And this one seems like a straightforward case of entertaining, but ultimately fake, election news.A Downing Street spokesman has commented on the issue of voter ID.The facts are that local authorities told all voters that they need to bring a form of ID in these pilot areas. ID can be things like a bus pass, a driver’s licence. The overwhelming majority of people are casting their vote without a problem. A great deal of work has been done in these pilot areas to prepare the public. In places like Bromley, people will have had six pieces of direct mail about the pilot and there’s been a widespread poster campaign.Bradford Council has apologised after a presiding officer turned away voters for not bringing photo ID to a polling station, despite none being necessary. Finnegan Pope-Carter, a company director from Shipley, near Bradford, said he arrived at a polling station at 8am and was asked for identification papers. He was eventually allowed to vote after fetching his driving licence from his car but his wife Chrys Harris, an archaeological geophysicist, was refused multiple times. “I didn’t have my polling card or a photo ID on me. I told them repeatedly that I did not need them either. They refused and said I did,” she told the Press Association. Harris said she almost gave up on casting her vote as the polling station clerks assisted other voters. “I stood my ground and finally they rang a superior who said I was allowed a ballot,” she said. The couple, both 29, described the experience as “very stressful”, but said that Bradford Council had assured them it would not happen again.A spokesman for Bradford Council said: We apologise to the very small number of voters concerned who were asked to provide ID to vote in one Shipley polling station today. We were alerted to the matter early this morning and it was dealt with immediately. To confirm, there is no requirement for voters to provide ID to cast a vote and a further message has been issued to all polling staff.Do leave comments about any stories you think we should cover on the blog, or tweet me @nadiakhomami. We’ll keep this rolling until Andrew Sparrow takes over the reins later today for all your local election coverage.My colleague Peter Walker is in Penge, South East London, where there are more reports of voters without ID being turned away from the polling booth.

This causes more babies to be born prematurely and with a low birth weight, researchers from the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health said. Children born in England also tend to have more birth anomalies – such as congenital heart defects – than in Sweden.The study, published in the Lancet, used medical data from the NHS and the Swedish health service to compare births from 2003 to 2012 and track the children’s health and death records up to their fifth birthday.These records included information on the mother’s age, the family’s socioeconomic position, the length of pregnancy, the child’s birth weight and gender, and whether the child had any birth anomalies. Overall, the study included more than 3.9 million English births, with 11,392 deaths, and more than a million Swedish births and 1,927 deaths. Between two days and four years old, the child mortality rate for England was one and a half times higher than for Sweden (29 deaths per 10,000 children in England, compared with 19 in Sweden). If the child mortality rate had been the same, there would have been 607 fewer child deaths per year in England, equivalent to 6,073 in total over the period. The differences were mainly driven by differences in mortality among children under one. Lead author Dr Ania Zylbersztejn of UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health said: “While child deaths are still rare, the UK has one of the highest child mortality rates in western Europe.“Babies born prematurely or with low birth weight have an increased risk of early death, and those who survive are more likely to have chronic ill-health or disability.” Good maternal health – including maintaining a healthy weight, avoiding chronic illnesses such as diabetes and avoiding high blood pressure, psychological stress and infections – and healthy behaviours such as eating a balanced diet and avoiding smoking, drugs and alcohol are associated with healthy foetal development during pregnancy. This suggests many more people in England are socioeconomically disadvantaged, which is associated with pre-term births, low birth weight, birth anomalies and poor maternal health, reflecting circumstances and behaviours linked to poverty and stress. Prof Anders Hjern of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute said: “This study shows that the main explanations for the differences in child mortality rates between England and Sweden are systemic, and beyond the reach of healthcare services alone. “The key factors here are likely to include Sweden’s broader welfare programmes that have provided families with an economic safety net for over 50 years, the free and accessible educational system, including early childcare, and public health policies for many lifestyle issues such as obesity, smoking and alcohol use.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0fd38cd1d45f61ee13be034e7639ac794ff08c1/279_634_6212_3727/master/6212.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e93f5984fc533684892866ca376b0f02","title":"team sky chris froome giro d italia accused 14m mauro vegni","story":"Team Sky have been accused of deceiving the organisers of the Giro d’Italia into handing over a reported €1.4m in appearance fees by not disclosing that their star rider Chris Froome had already failed a drug test.According to the Giro race director, Mauro Vegni, Dave Brailsford’s team entered into negotiations over Froome’s appearance in the Giro knowing the rider had returned an adverse finding from a urine test on his way to winning the Vuelta a España in September last year.Sky secured a hefty fee for the four‑times Tour de France winner and a support team to contest the Giro, which begins on Friday in Jerusalem, the first time the race has travelled outside Europe.But on the eve of the event, Vegni made the remarkable claim that he felt let down by Brailsford after the  and the French newspaper Le\u0026nbspMonde made public news of Froome’s failed test in December. Vegni said this was the first time he became aware of the anti-doping case lingering over the Briton, which could lead to Froome being suspended from cycling for several months.Asked if he felt deceived by Brailsford, who was knighted for services to cycling in 2013, Vegni replied: “Definitely, yes. The negotiations with Team Sky took place before the Giro presentation so I would have expected within a correct relationship to be informed. I didn’t really like this.”In a bid to repair relations with the organisers, Brailsford flew to Italy to explain the situation. “I did express my thinking on the phone to Dave, he came immediately to Italy to meet with me,” Vegni said. “Dave himself was not pleased and he told me that in fact he did not receive the information until the end of September. But he also said to me that he was confident that this whole issue will find a solution.”The launch of the 101st edition of the Giro took place last November, with Froome confirming his participation via a video message. The 32‑year‑old arrived in Israel this week confident of clinching a triple crown of grand tour wins: the Tour de France, Vuelta a España, and now Giro, all in a row. But there is every chance his Vuelta title could be taken away if he receives an anti-doping rule violation.Tom Dumoulin\u0026nbspThe Dutchman is attempting to defend the pink jersey he won in thrilling style, overturning a 53 second deficit to secure victory on the final day of the 2017 edition of the Giro. Riding for Team Sunweb he is supported by two of the riders who helped him to success but has endured a tumultuous start to the season, plagued by mechanical issues in the Abu Dhabi Tour and abandoning the\u0026nbspTirreno-Adriatico after crashing several timesThibaut Pinot\u0026nbspAfter attempting the Giro and Tour double last season, the Frenchman will tackle the same challenge once again, hoping for a better result. He finished fourth behind Dumoulin last year, losing ground in the time trials but his overall victory in the Tour of the Alps, where he won by 12 seconds indicate he is in even better form this time round. With just two weeks since the end of that race and the Grand Tour it will be intriguing to see how the Groupama-FDJ rider has recovered.Simon Yates\u0026nbspNot as hotly fancied for the Giro title as his compatriot Froome but Yates has displayed eye catching form of late with two stage wins and an overall second-place finish at the prestigious Paris-Nice. The 25-year-old will\u0026nbsplead his Michelton-Scott team\u0027s bid to win\u0026nbspand said he is relishing that role and the opportunity to usurp the favourites. Finshing seventh on his Tour De France debut last year and sixth at the Vuelta a Ea in 2016 he has proved he is not overawed by the big occasions.Froome is attempting to explain why a urine test submitted after the 18th stage of the Vuelta on 7\u0026nbspSeptember indicated twice the permitted level of the asthma drug salbutamol. Cycling’s world governing body, the UCI, sent a letter to Team Sky, Froome and British Cycling to inform them of the failed test on 20\u0026nbspSeptember. It is understood talks with Giro organisers began in the following weeks.Vegni expressed his frustration that it had taken so long to reach a verdict. “I feel bad because of the extremely long times of the justice procedure. With the current means that are available to not have a decision made after eight months, something needs to change. We don’t even know when a decision will finally arrive.”In a statement, Team Sky said: “The UCI process regarding Chris would normally have remained confidential. The team wanted to fully respect this but since it became public we have stayed in regular touch with the Giro organisers about it. We received and agreed the final race contract within the last three weeks – obviously some time after the issue had became public. In all our conversations with the organisers they have been supportive of Chris’s participation in the race. We love the Giro. We are honoured to be competing at it and we can’t wait for it to start.”The extent to which Froome’s participation has dominated the buildup to this race was enforced in the pre‑race press conference. It took 33 minutes before any rider other than Froome or any of the other 21 teams competing here was discussed.“Thank you for someone who recognises that it is not just Chris Froome at the Giro,” an exasperated Vegni said. Froome’s principal rival in the next few weeks is likely to be Tom Dumoulin. The Dutch defending champion has had a tumultuous start to the season but Vegni intimated that a victory for Domoulin would be better than if Froome triumphed in Rome on 27\u0026nbspMay.“As organiser, I don’t really support any rider specifically, but let me add that Tom is a nice character,” Vegni said. “He’s young, he’s handsome, he is good for cycling as a whole. Also as an athlete he is a good performer. Let’s say that it would be really a good outcome for the Giro.”The mounting tensions over Froome’s presence are not the only contentious issue to plague the Giro this year. The decision to hold the opening three stages of the race in Israel has also led to the organisers being accused of “sport-washing”, using the event to distract from the rising heat of the Palestine conflict.The team presentation on Thursday evening took place on a giant pink stage in Jerusalem’s Safra Square, with smoke cannons and disco lights, introduced by the supermodel Bar Refaeli. But on Friday, less than 100km from here, the protests on the Gaza strip which have taken place every week since 30\u0026nbspMarch will continue unabated. The Israeli military has reportedly killed 35 Palestinians and injured more than 5,500 others during these protests, with Amnesty International suggesting some have been shot from behind and intentionally maimed.The tensions mean that an unprecedented police presence will be deployed along the route. More than 4,000 officers and two helicopters are securing the roads and the perimeter.Superintendent Mickey Rosenfeld, the Israel Police national spokesman, said it was the biggest sporting event to be held in Israel’s history.“We’re focusing on a mega-sport event and not political or security related issues,” he said. “But we are taking no chances. Our units will be at the right place at the right time. We are coordinating with border police, undercover units, special patrol units and our assessments will be made as events unfold. But no rider has personally expressed any misgivings about coming to Israel, as far as we know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20c57383100bd065e0d357e7480a1286857e3a32/87_22_2636_1582/master/2636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3dcef2bf576c6fa905346a95a4394d1","title":"f1 drivers overtaking alexander wurz","story":"The first skirmish in the battle to secure the future of Formula One threw up an unlikely and unexpected result when the sport announced it would be introducing rule changes for next year to improve overtaking. It was an engagement that had looked doomed from the off, faced with the natural self-interest of the teams, but the success bodes well for F1, the fans and the drivers, who can claim no small part in bringing about the first step in what should be a new era for the sport.F1’s new owners, Liberty Media, and the FIA have pulled off something of a coup by managing to secure the requisite votes at the F1 Commission to impose new regulations for next season. The key change is a new front wing, to decrease turbulent air in the wake of a car that prevents competitors following one another closely and hinders passing. The problem has been openly criticised by drivers but they can now feel genuinely optimistic about the future of F1.The former driver Alex Wurz is the chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association and he is delighted with the decision. “It could be the starting point for a game-changer,” he says.Wurz is an out-and-out racer. He competed in F1 for four full seasons with some memorable performances, including going wheel to wheel with Michael Schumacher at Monaco, a superb podium at Canada in 2007 and a brilliant run to fourth in the wet at the Nürburgring the same year. He has won Le\u0026nbspMans twice and the Sebring 12 Hours once after a fine battle with Sébastien Bourdais over the final laps.Since he took up his role at the GPDA in 2014 the Austrian has also become hugely respected for working closely with the drivers. He reveals he has been having closed-door discussions with them almost every race weekend. Unsurprisingly what they want chimes with what the fans want to see.“We are very happy that Liberty, with the FIA, have seen that we can’t continue going down the road of creating artificial overtaking with DRS,” he says. “A natural overtaking manoeuvre that is purely and visibly down to the driver’s skill is what creates the biggest emotions for fans and drivers. If we can follow each other closely we are more likely to have old-school, authentic overtaking and that’s what the drivers would love to see and why this rule change is such good news.”The vote was not expected to go in their favour. The commission required four teams to support it, which was thought unlikely, but it is understood Williams, Mercedes, Force India and Sauber did so.The teams that did not support it have fairly clear objections. Firstly, there is a cost, both financial and in resources, associated with designing new aerodynamics and it is late in the season to have to apply it to the designs of next year’s car. There is also a fear that it is an untested theory that could backfire, and that it would be better to stick with the status quo until the next major regulation change set for 2021. That F1 and FIA have nonetheless stuck with a forward-looking, bold decision is indicative of a new outlook for the sport.He remains cautious that the new rules are not yet a done deal – Ferrari still have a right to veto it and may yet do so. “I was a bit surprised it went through,” he says. “This is a change which can reshuffle the performance order, therefore I thought the teams that are in power would stop it in their own interest but if it goes through it is a success for everyone pulling in the same direction and looking at the big picture.”For the owners, who have made changes aplenty since taking over last year, this is the first move to have a real effect on the racing itself. That they have managed an unlikely victory is something that will give Wurz, his members and fans cause to celebrate. F1’s future remains undecided and some very tough talking lies ahead, but Wurz senses this heralds a genuine wind of change in F1.“There is optimism,” he says. “There was an established paddock culture that came with a single stakeholder dictating the sport and it adopting his culture of being run. Now there is a new culture and it has still to merge. It will take years but once it starts and everyone aligns to the new thinking I think we will see it accelerate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed331d09aa26989b15de2bf987a25ee3adc08716/0_0_4759_3543/master/4759.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bd096bd99e84e257afff2c76a6b85969 1760w","title":"twitter change password bug discovered","story":"Company says it has fixed the internal glitch and has seen ‘no indication of breach or misuse’ but recommends precautionary stepsTwitter has urged its 336 million users to change their passwords after the company discovered a bug that stored passwords in plain text in an internal system.The company said it had fixed the problem and had seen “no indication of breach or misuse”, but it suggested users consider changing their password on Twitter and on all services where they have used the same password “as a precaution”.“We are very sorry this happened,” said Twitter’s chief technology officer, Parag Agrawal, in a blogpost. “We recognise and appreciate the trust you place in us, and are committed to earning that trust every day.”Companies with good security practices typically store user passwords in a form that cannot be read.

I am looking for a 13in laptop in the £500-£700 range. I am not too picky about the aesthetics. What matters most is that it’s fast and can handle more tasks than just email and browsing. What is my best bet? IvanaThis is an interesting question, partly because the mainstream PC market is broadly ided into two main groups. There are lots of low-end laptops aimed at consumers, and they usually cost around £250 to £500. (Yes, there are even cheaper systems.) Examples include the Lenovo Ideapad 110, Asus VivoBook, and lots of HP Pavilion and Dell Inspiron laptops. Most are relatively slow, but some are fast enough for your purposes.There are also lots of upmarket laptops for high-end buyers and freelancers, and they usually cost from £750 to £1,500. (Yes, there are even more expensive systems, especially the ones designed for gaming.) Examples include the Dell XPS 13, Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, HP’s Spectre 13 and EliteBook x360 G2, the Microsoft Surface range and many more. Most of them are thin and fast, but you are also paying a premium for aesthetics.The third option is to look at laptops aimed at IT managers, especially those in large corporations. Most are designed more for durability, reparability and predictability than for speed or style. The main examples are Lenovo (formerly IBM) ThinkPads, Dell Latitudes, and HP Elitebooks. You can also buy refurbished models of these machines from corporate asset management companies such as Tier1Online.It would be useful to know the specification of the laptop that you used in your corporate job, for comparison purposes, and the work involved. How fast was the processor? How much memory did it have? Did it have a traditional hard disk drive or a faster SSD? What was the screen resolution?Was your corporate laptop as fast as you wanted, or did it feel too slow?If you know which CPU you had, you can check its PassMark score, or find it on Notebookcheck’s list of mobile processor benchmarks. You will then be able to make sure you buy a faster CPU and as much or more memory than you had before.A typical corporate laptop today might have an Intel Core i5-5200U or similar processor, 8GB of memory, and a 128GB or 256GB SSD. I reckon you would find that a usable specification. However, it can be very frustrating to go from a fast laptop to a slow one, so try to avoid that.As for size, 13.3in screens are not as popular as they used to be, and there are now models with 10.1in, 11.6in, 12.5in and 14in screens as well. Ultraportables with 10.1in or 11.6in screens are a bit small for everyday use, but 14in models are becoming increasingly common.If you buy a consumer laptop you’ll have the advantage of shopping for one of the better models, but there’s not a lot to choose between them. There’s been a trend towards more solid construction and better trackpads, along with higher prices.You can check out the different models at stores such as PC World and John Lewis, but there are many other suppliers. I’m linking to PC World partly because I did that myself on Tuesday.The main drawback with the HP Pavilion 14 and similar consumer laptops is that most of them have a standard Windows screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. But if this is what you’re used to, you probably won’t mind.One of the advantages of buying a Dell business laptop – not an Inspiron – is that you can add next-business-day on-site service for a low price. For example, you could get a 14in Vostro 5471 from Dell’s small businesssoho range with a Core i5-8250U8GB256GB spec for £579 plus delivery and VAT. You could then add four years of collect-and-return service for £50.36, or four years of on-site service for £95.14. I’ve used this service in the past, and have it on my current Dell desktop. I can confirm that having someone turn up on your doorstep to fix things is fantastic value for 46p a week.The Vostro 5471 with the spec mentioned, four years of ProSupport Plus and on-site service, VAT and delivery currently comes to £885.05. It busts your budget, but if you are used to getting good IT support, it’s probably worth it.Bear in mind that you can also buy HP laptops direct and add three years of pick up-and-return service for £79 or less. If you like the HP Pavilion 14, you can get a 14-bk002na with 4GB and a Full HD (1920 x 1080-pixel) screen for £429, or a silver Pavilion x360 14-ba007na with 8GB and a 1366 x 768 screen for (flash sale) £449.10. Both these laptops have Core i3-7100U processors and 128GB SSDs.Most Pavilion 14 laptops have two memory slots, so you should be able to expand a 4GB system to 8GB, but check before buying. Their usual maximum memory is 16GB.Most refurb buyers are looking for cheap machines, typically under £250. In your case, you could get a high-end laptop – the latest X1 Carbon starts at £1,439.99 – within your budget.Refurbs are available from many other websites including Laptop Outlet and Dell Outlet, as well as on Amazon and eBay. As long as you go for a decent spec, they should do what you need.Have you got a question?

The move, if confirmed, would mark the first Chinese missile deployments in the Spratly islands, where several Asian countries including Vietnam and Taiwan have rival claims. CNBC quoted unnamed sources as saying that according to US intelligence assessments, the missiles had been moved to Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef and Mischief Reef within the past 30 days. China has made no mention of any missile deployments but says its military facilities in the Spratlys are purely defensive, and that it can do what it likes on its own territory.Greg Poling, a South China Sea expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank, said deploying missiles on the outposts would be important. “These would be the first missiles in the Spratlys, either surface to air, or anti-ship,” he said. He added that such deployments were expected as China built missile shelters on the reefs last year and already deployed such missile systems on Woody Island further to the north. Poling said it would be another step on China’s road to dominating the South China Sea, a key global trade route. “Before this, if you were one of the other claimants ... you knew that China was monitoring your every move. Now you will know that you’re operating inside Chinese missile range. That’s a pretty strong, if implicit, threat,” he said. Last month, US Admiral Philip Davidson, nominated to head US Pacific command, said China’s “forward operating bases” in the South China Sea appeared complete. “The only thing lacking are the deployed forces,” he said. Once these were added, “China will be able to extend its influence thousands of miles to the south and project power deep into Oceania”. The White House warned China would face “consequences” for its military buildup in contested waters.“We’re well aware of China’s militarisation of the South China Sea,” said press secretary Sarah Sanders.“We’ve raised concerns directly with the Chinese about this and there will be near-term and long-term consequences.”Sanders did not say what the consequences would be.Beijing reasserted its right to build “defence” facilities in the disputed region, but declined to confirm reports it had installed new missiles on artificial islands it had built.Beijing sees the area as key to pushing its defenses beyond China’s coast and securing oil supply routes.Washington and other western countries have insisted disputes must be settled legally and freedom of navigation be respected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc12e627622b8b40472a7025ec3d140df913bf4c/522_0_2421_1453/master/2421.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40b544985c15ddc765322cef70d7d30b","title":"mh370 search offers clues for 19th century shipwreck mysteries","story":"Unprecedented search operation leads to discovery of two vessels that sank south-west of AustraliaMaritime historians on Thursday published a short list of possible identities of two shipwrecks found in the course of the initial 710,000 sq km (274,000 sq mile), three-year search for the Boeing 777 that was lost in 2014 with 238 people aboard. The wrecks were found in 2015, seven months and 36 km apart, 2,300 km south-west of Australia in debris fields scattered with coal more than 3.7 km below the ocean’s surface.The searchers had a closer look with underwater drones that took photographs of both sites and retrieved a coal sample from one. Analysis showed the coal was probably from Britain, a Western Australian Museum report said. The museum’s examination of the images of the scattered remnants of a ship discovered on 19 May 2015, found it was possibly the brig W Gordon or the barque Magdala, according to incomplete records of ships lost in that period. W Gordon was on a voyage from Scotland to Australia when it disappeared in 1877 with 10 crew aboard. Magdala was lost in 1882 while sailing from Wales to Indonesia. The report found the splintered wreck was most likely sunk by an explosion. Coal cargoes in the era exploded through sparking of methane gas accumulating below deck or the spontaneous combustion of overheated coal. An iron wreck found on 19 December 2015 was most likely the barque West Ridge, which vanished while sailing from England to India with 28 sailors in 1883, the report said. A coal sample from that wreck suggested the cargo was from Britain. There was no evidence of what caused the disaster, but the wreck’s location east of the trade route from Europe to Asia suggested it might have been heading to the closest port in Australia for help.The museum’s assistant curator of maritime archaeology, Ross Anderson, said the new data about the two 19th century sinkings was a significant byproduct of the search for MH370, which was flying from Malaysia to China when communications with it were lost. But Anderson doubted that the identities of the two deepest wrecks found in the Indian Ocean would ever be confirmed without a wealthy private benefactor because of their depth and remoteness. “These are the deepest wrecks so far located in the Indian Ocean, they’re some of the most remote shipwrecks in the world,” he said. The initial underwater sonar probe scoured remote seabed at depths of up to 6,000 meters (20,000 ft) before Malaysia, China and Australia agreed to end the state-funded search for MH370 last year. The wrecks were found during that search. The wrecks of two trawlers sunk the late 20th century were also discovered, but the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which supervised the search, did not ask the museum to research them. Ocean Infinity, a US technology company conducting a new search, said this week it had covered nearly 80,000 sq km since January without finding any sign of the plane’s wreckage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/432378c97aa4f8bb8ceaad942dd0cddf30ce0d82/0_168_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c155b64d1ade49e31330c2c26e0d0f9","title":"my whole life has been a lie sweden admits meatballs are turkish","story":"Turks don’t mince their words as they relish news that Ikea’s famous dish is not SwedishTurks have reacted with undisguised glee to what many have described as an official – and certainly long overdue – confession from Stockholm that Sweden’s signature national dish is, in fact, Turkish. “Those famous Swedish meatballs you get in Ikea are actually Turkish, admits Swedish government,” tweeted TRT World, Turkey’s publicly funded international television news channel. “Swedish meatballs originally Turkish dish: Swedish government,” said the headline in Hürriyet Daily News, after Sweden’s official national Twitter account, @swedense, came clean last weekend.“Swedish meatballs are actually based on a recipe King Charles XII brought home from Turkey in the early 18th century,” the Swedish account revealed abruptly and for no immediately apparent reason. “Let’s stick to the facts!”Turkey’s Anadolu agency seized the chance to speak to Annie Mattsson, of the literature department at Uppsala University, who confirmed that after losing a key battle against Russia in 1709, Charles and the remnants of his army took refuge in what is now Moldova, then part of the Ottoman empire. Once known as “the Lion of the North” and “Swedish Meteor” for his early military prowess, Charles, who acceded to the throne in 1697 at the age of 15, had bitten off rather more than he could chew by taking on Russia, and spent the following six years in exile in and around present-day Turkey.Having acquired a taste for the local cuisine, he returned to Sweden in 1714 with the recipe not just for köfte, the spiced lamb and beef meatballs that in time became the Swedish staple köttbullar, but also for the popular stuffed cabbage dish now known in Sweden as kåldolmar.In Turkey’s meatball capital, Inegöl, this week, a local chef, İbrahim Veysel, told the Doğan news agency it was an honour that the Turkish dish should have become “an example to different cuisines all over the world”.Others were less happy. Serdar Çam, president of the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency, complained that Ikea, which sells 2m meatballs a day in its in-store restaurants, should not be selling the dish as though it were Swedish.Örjan, the forlorn – though presumably tongue-in-cheek – Swede currently curating the country’s @sweden tourism account, rotated every week, lamented that the news had robbed life of its meaning. “My whole life has been a lie,” he tweeted."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3483403.1525371682!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse officer regrets not checking if women were told of false tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrom left,  Dr Jerome Coffey, director, National Cancer Control Programme, Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer, Department of Health, and Dr Colm Henry, the HSE’s chief clinical officer,  at the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe HSE’s chief clinical officer, Colm Henry, has said he regrets not checking whether women with cervical cancer were being told about false negative smear tests when he learned about it last August.Dr Henry said he was told last summer the CervicalCheck national screening programme had changed its communication policy and the affected women would be told about discrepancies in past tests. However, he did not follow up to verify that they had been informed.He was speaking at a press conference in Dublin convened by the State’s chief medical officer, Dr Tony Holohan, to address public concerns about the national screening programme in the wake of the scandal involving women with cervical cancer not being told about false smear test results.Dr Henry said he learned, after a meeting between the CervicalCheck screening programme and leading clinicians on September 1st, 2017, the programme’s communication policy had changed following a year-long dispute with doctors over whose responsibility it was to tell the women.At the time, he was the HSE’s national clinical adviser to the country’s acute hospitals.“In retrospect, had I known that this didn’t happen – that patients weren’t being informed – even in my then role as an adviser with no authority over these people, I would certainly have done things differently,” he told reporters at the event in the Royal College of Physicians. “But I was basing my actions at the time on the assumption that people were following through on what they told me they were doing.”He took assurances CervicalCheck’s communication policy had changed “at face value”, he said.“Do I regret that now? Of course I do. I had no reason to doubt what they were telling me. If I was going back now, with the benefit of hindsight, I regret I didn’t go further. At the time I acted as best I could,” he said. Asked whether he should consider his position in light of his knowledge of the communications failures, he replied: “I had no involvement in the screening programme at the time.”Dr Holohan said he learned women had not been told only on Thursday of last week following the High Court case taken by Limerick mother-of-two Vicky Phelan, who secured a €2.5 million settlement from a US laboratory which assessed a test for CervicalCheck. Ms Phelan discovered a 2011 smear test that had originally shown no abnormalities was, three years later, found to be inaccurate, but she was not told of the false test until September 2017.In the aftermath of her case, a HSE audit found that of 1,482 women diagnosed with cervical cancer in the past decade, errors were found in 208 cases where tests showed no abnormality but should have raised a cancer warning. Some 162 were found not to have been told. Of the 208, 17 have since died.The cases of a further 1,518 women with cervical cancer who were not screened by CervicalCheck will also be audited. Correspondence from the case shows that Dr Henry was made aware of the dispute between CervicalCheck and the doctors in August 2017 over who should tell the women about the tests. Dr Holohan defended Dr Henry’s actions, saying he did not believe there was any requirement for Dr Henry to escalate his concerns about the issue to the Department of Health last summer.“I don’t think that it is necessary that every issue that is identified within the HSE requires for its effective management to be escalated to the department,” he said.The State’s chief medical officer sought to reassure the public that there was no problem with the quality of the screening programme itself. “Clearly there was a substantial failure in terms of communications that should not have happened, that needs to be adequately explained and needs to be fully investigated,” he said.Dr Henry described the controversy as a “failure of clinical governance”.Dr Jerome Coffey, director of the National Cancer Control Programme, said there was “a tiny, tiny probability” – less than one in 100 – of false negative smear tests. He praised the CervicalCheck screening programme for helping to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by about 7 per cent a year.

Photograph: Harald TittelAFPGetty His view over Brussels’s magnificent Grand Place from La Maison du Cygne was a vivid architectural representation of what he was trying to write. History as class struggle.The tall gothic and baroque guild houses, an expression of the rise to pre-eminence of the merchant bourgeoisie, and the town hall spoke of municipal power and wealth. And surrounded by a city teeming with the poor and hungry . . .An impoverished Karl Marx, barely 30, spent three years here from 1846.And in the back room of what is now one of Brussels’ most chic restaurants, with friend Friedrich Engels, he laboured over their most important work, The Manifesto of the Communist Party, part-groundbreaking philosophical and historical thesis, but above all a call to action that would reverberate around the world.Two hundred years ago next Saturday, Marx was born in the small German town of Trier, where EU commission president Jean-Claude Juncker will deliver a speech for the birthday unveiling of a 5.5m statue of the local boy, a gift from the People’s Republic of China.“Nobody can deny that Karl Marx is a figure who shaped history in one way or the other,” a commission spokeswoman defensively insisted. “Not speaking about him would come close to denying history.”His intellectual legacy is everywhere. Last week with a laugh, a senior Irish diplomat described to me the “mao dun” – Chinese for “internal contradiction” – at the heart of a commission proposal. Doomed, he was suggesting, like capitalism and its contradictions, to the dustbin of history.Neither Juncker nor my diplomat, you may be relieved to hear, are closet Marxists, but in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 , they, like many others, economists, historians and philosophers, have been willing to look again seriously at the ideas of a man at whose door most of the 20th century’s woes have been unfairly laid by conventional opinion.And yet. No more than the bloody crusades, or the terreur and the guillotine can be said definitively to characterise Christendom or the French Republic,\u0026nbsp Marx too can and must be rescued from his disciples’ excesses and intellectual rigidities. “If anything is certain,” he would claim to “revolutionary phrase-mongering” adherents, “it is that I myself am not a Marxist.”Rescuing Marx is first and foremost about rescuing his thinking from the charge – a caricature – of dogmatism and rigidity. On the contrary, it is above all a methodology of thinking and analysis, not a fixed position, not a political programme, nor a set of explicit prescriptions for the world’s ills.One that explores the dynamics of constant change in the economic, political and ideological spheres as the working-out of contradictions. In Marx’s view, these are the tensions between old ways of creating the means of survival, and their social organisation, and new, emerging forms of economic and political organisation. Irreconcilable opposites in whose synthesis the new world is created.But for Marx, and his “historical materialism”, history itself was inherently open-ended: “All history is nothing but a continuous transformation of human nature.”“In Marx’s vision, which cannot recognise anything as absolutely final,” the late philosopher István Mészáros wrote, “there can be no place for a utopian golden age, neither ‘round the corner’ nor astronomical distances away. Such a golden age would be an end of history, and thus the end of man himself.”It was not Marxists who announced “the end of history” on the fall of the Soviet Union, supposedly the triumph of capitalism as the highest and unsurpassable civilisation. Such finality is absurd to them.Marx’s analysis and insights have made much of modern sociology and shaped political and historical theory. Gender theory, race theory, and new insights into humanity’s ecological death wish, have all added to and deepened his insights into the exploitation that drives capitalismEven right-wing economists nod at his critique of the market. The jury may still be out on whether, as he predicts, there is an inevitable tendency for the rate of profit to fall.But, most recently, in a powerful dissection of the data on wealth concentrations and distribution over the last 250 years, French economist Thomas Piketty convincingly linked growing global inequality to the fact that the rate of capital return in developed countries is persistently greater than the rate of economic growth. In other words, as Marx predicted, under capitalism the rich will get richer and the poor, poorer .“The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways the point is to change it,” Marx wrote in 1845. And the view of the cobbled square from the Maison du Cygne remains.

Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481984.1525297392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords backs move to prevent hard border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble:   said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesBritain’s House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border after Brexit under which no new checks or controls could be imposed without the agreement of the Irish Government. Peers voted by 309 to 242 in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was proposed by former Conservative minister and EU commissioner Chris Patten. It says Brexit must not diminish any form of North-South co-operation or create or facilitate Border arrangements featuring any new infrastructure, checks or controls without an agreement between London and Dublin. Lord Patten said the amendment reflected prime minister Theresa May’s stated policy, which was under pressure from hardline Brexiteers, and he rejected the charge that raising fears about a hard border was playing with fire.“I will tell you what I think playing with fire is: blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy which is sometimes clueless and sometimes delinquent with a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. That is playing with fire. That is what we are in danger of doing,” he said.Former first minister David Trimble was one of a number of former unionist politicians to speak against the amendment, suggesting that Brussels and Dublin were seeking to change the way Northern Ireland was governed.“The drive is there to get Northern Ireland into a special situation: linked permanently to the European Union and with the union with the rest of the United Kingdom to that extent weakened,” he said.Lord Trimble said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London, which had improved dramatically since the Good Friday Agreement.“They have been extremely good and I am delighted, but the behaviour at the moment of the Irish prime minister and Coveney, backed up by the European Union, is actually destroying that relationship and doing considerable damage to it,” he said.Wednesday night’s vote, in which 19 Conservative peers supported the amendment, was the 10th defeat the Lords have inflicted on the government during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

scowling celestial body annoyed that a rocket ship has crashed into its eye in A Trip to the Moon (1902), Melies was most recently seen in Martin Scorsese\u0027s film Hugo (2011) where he was played in old age by Sir Ben Kingsley.He was born in 1861, the son of luxury shoemakers who - after attending the prestigious Lycee Louis-le-Grand, completing military service and serving an apprenticeship as a clerk in London - shunned the family business to work as a conjurer at the Theatre Robert-Houdin in Paris.Here, Melies developed a fondness for stagecraft and visual effects, working with mechanical automata, trapdoors and lighting, eventually selling his boot factory shares to his brothers and buying the theatre outright. After seeing the Lumiere Brothers sensational moving picture camera in action in 1895, Melies rushed out to establish his own studio and began making films that featured clever illusions and tricks created by experimenting with double exposure, cutting and rewinding, building on his theatrical innovations.Using elaborate painted sets akin to those of Paris\u0027s music halls, Melies was a true pioneer who played a key role in the evolution of cinematic technique and the medium\u0027s storytelling grammar.He also had an acute sensitivity for the sort of blockbuster spectacle audiences would be attracted to.Specialising in horror and steam punk science fiction, taking inspiration from the fiction of late Victorian visionaries Jules Verne and HG Wells, his most famous film remains A Trip To The Moon, which starred acrobats and dancers from the Folies Bergere and the Chatelet ballet.As fantastic as this is, perhaps even more extraordinary is the later Tunnelling The English Channel (1907), in which he effectively predicted the advent of Eurostar and the Channel Tunnel.Other celebrated works including The Vanishing Lady, The Haunted Castle (both 1896), The Astronomer\u0027s Dream (1898), Bluebeard (1901), The Impossible Voyage (1904), The Merry Frolics of Satan (1906) and Baron Munchausen (1911).The aftermath of a cyclone in a short by Georges Melies (Getty)Tragically, after more than 500 short films, Melies\u0027s career collapsed with the onset of the First World War. He went bankrupt and was forced to sell his back catalogue to Pathe.An early setback had come when Melies planned to release A Trip To The Moon in America, only to find that Thomas Edison\u0027s representative Al Adabie had secretly copied a print of the film after bribing staff at a London cinema and had already released it in the US without permission - an early and particularly devastating case of film piracy.Later reduced to running a toy stall and selling sweets at Montparnasse train station in Paris (as depicted in Hugo), Melies became so embittered that he dug a hole in his garden, filled it with what remained of his priceless reels and memorabilia and burned it all.What was lost that dark day is almost too painful to think about.However, he did live long enough to see his films reassessed and acclaimed and to receive the Legion d\u0027Honneur before finally passing away in 1938.27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Amazingly, a colour print of A Trip To The Moon was unearthed in a French barn in 2002 in which each frame had been meticulously hand-painted by a large female work force a century earlier.The world greeted its restoration and re-release with the same excitement and anticipation of its premiere at a Paris fairground and the film continues to inspire affectionate parodies and homages in everything from the Smashing Pumpkins\u0027 video for Tonight, Tonight (1996) to Futurama (1999-2013) and The Mighty Boosh (2004-13).or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in GermanyA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.\u0026#13Melanie McGrice, who was not involved with the study, said: “As a fertility dietician, I’m seeing more and more women who incorrectly think that they should be avoiding fruit in an effort to help them conceive.“This study demonstrates that fruit consumption is not only safe, but beneficial for most women to optimise their fertility.“Fruit is rich in antioxidants, vitamins and phytochemicals, and should not be lumped into the same basket as sugar and soft drinks.”Additional reporting by PAor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Boris Johnson and Michael Gove also oppose itWith the overall balance of the cabinet six to five against the proposal, one source said Brexiteers now believe they have “killed” the option.Peers defeat government on plan for Irish border after BrexitUK police use EU system that may be lost post-Brexit 539m times a yearThe best Brexit deal does involve leaving the customs unionThis is why you should care about the local electionsAre countries really ‘queuing up for trade deals’ with Brexit UK?May ‘held hostage by extreme Brexiteers’ as customs decisions delayedBut in a sign that Ms May is not ready to let go of it, the prime minister asked for more work to be done on both of her existing proposals.The partnership plan would see Britain collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf at ports and airports, passing on a share of the money to Brussels – then if the UK sets different tariffs from the EU, traders would claim refunds from HMRC for goods that stay in Britain.Olly Robbins, Ms May’s Europe adviser, regards the partnership as a means of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, while keeping the UK out of the European customs union. Close aides of Ms May have also called it “intellectually perfect”.But Downing Street has been privately warned that the customs partnership proposal could collapse the government, with the Brexit-backing European Research Group having organised a critical report backed by 60 MPs.Boris Johnson: Northern Irish border being used to try and keep the UK in the customs unionThe group’s chairman, Jacob Rees-Mogg, has called the proposal “cretinous”, “deeply unsatisfactory” and argued that it would “not get us out of the European Union, which is what people voted for”.The other option, a “streamlined arrangement”, is viewed more favourably by Brexiteers in both the cabinet and on the back benches.It is known as “maximum facilitation”, or even “max fac”, and would see the UK outside any customs union, but with some controls at the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.Backers say a “trusted trader” scheme and remote monitoring of the border would limit physical infrastructure.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

That work has been proceeding. Ideas are obviously evolving as we go along.”The European commission has been pushing back against all of UK proposals, with reports that Brussels regards both as unworkable.EU officials have said they want a solution for the Irish border, and in turn customs arrangements, by its forthcoming summit in June.Failure to come up with an agreed plan could leave the UK forced to fall back on the European commission’s “backstop” option, which would effectively keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and see a customs border drawn down the Irish Sea.Ms May has insisted that no British prime minister could accept such a scenario, and the DUP which props up her government’s Commons majority have said they will not countenance it.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Some applications by British EU officials for Belgian citizenship have however been rejected because commission officials have a special diplomatic tax status.I know that the Prime Minister is often overflowing with generosity and will hear our wishesThe European Commission says that EU citizenship is a pre-condition for employment of EU staff members and that “the employment of EU officials of UK nationality may be terminated under the rules of the staff regulations in the event of Brexit”. Guidance issued to staff says they can request an exemption.Mr Juncker however last month told British staff they would not be fired once they ceased to meet the requirements for an EU job – which usually includes EU citizenship.Speaking in the same European Parliament debate former Ukip leader Nigel Farage launched an attack on the very concept of Belgium.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

And not for the campaigning or any potential results – for the fact that people have been stopped from voting.For the first time, trials are being conducted of new voter ID laws, which require people to bring proof of who they are. The new guidelines have proved controversial,\u0026nbspboth among people who disagree with the principle, and those who have fallen foul of them.They have already prompted intense anger from those who were turned away from their polling station. One voter in Bromley said he was outraged by the change – and that he would not be voting in protest.I\u0027m angry because I don\u0027t believe in carrying ID. Having the vote is a basic human right in a democracy, and this is supposed to be a democracy,” the 72-year-old added.I\u0027m choosing not to vote, and I\u0027ve never done that before. I think people who have problems with their ID will certainly be disenfranchised, even if they\u0027ve lived here for many years.As we know from this last week or two, there are a lot of people out there who are in that situation. And means I have to make a stand from that point of view too, because I know that they will be either disenfranchised or will not feel happy to come down and vote.What are voter ID rules?They require voters to carry with them\u0026nbspa piece of identification, which must be shown\u0026nbspwhen they arrive at the polling station. That, in short, is it but the controversy around it is a lot less simple.How are they being trialled?In this election, and in six places, people won\u0027t be able to cast their vote like normal. Instead, they will have to take identification with them to prove that they are who they say they are.It will be happening in Watford, Woking, Gosport, Bromley, and Swindon.Not all of the trials are exactly the same – Swindon, for instance, has strict rules that force people to show one of a very limited set of different pieces of ID, while others can bring almost anything that has their name on – but they are all working on the same principle.Why do people want them?Supporters of voter ID laws argue that they will stop people committing voter fraud by pretending to be someone else and voting on their behalf.At the moment, all that is required to vote is to know someone’s address – with that, you can turn up and pretend to be someone else, and cast their vote for them.What’s wrong with voter ID rules?First off, they solve a problem that does not really exist: while it might be theoretically possible for anyone to pose as anyone else, it simply does not seem to be happening.In 2016 – the number that the government is keen to use – there were only 44 incidents of voter fraud. That was in a year that millions of people voted, meaning that only a tiny proportion of the votes cast were fraudulent.And even that number has been disputed as misleading. The government used the fact that cases had more than doubled between 2014 and 2016, from 21 to 44 – but the UK Statistics Authority pointed out this week that it had dropped back down to 28 in 2017. And a lot of people voted in 2016, since there was the EU referendum, making the increase basically meaningless.Second, and perhaps more importantly, not everyone has the right kind of voter ID. And there are specific characteristics of those who don’t that people claim make the idea unfair.People who are poor, older or belong to minorities are less likely to have the right identification documents, for instance. This has led to accusations from Labour that their voters are being disproportionately shut out, and that voter ID laws therefore skew the elections unfairly in the Conservatives\u0027 favour.What’s wrong with testing them out?Ultimately, nobody knows how much that is the case: whether voting will be reduced significantly, and if that reduction will apply to any particular group. So testing them out in this way might seem to make sense.But the test itself is being run so badly\u0026nbspthat it will be hard to actually tell whether it has made\u0026nbspany difference. All of the five boroughs are remarkably similar to each other – the voters there are not especially old, are relatively poor, and their make-up is reasonably white – meaning that it will be hard to tell how they would affect places with different demographics. And more problematic than that is the fact that there is no real control group.The test could have been set up so that it took five places that are very different to each other, match them each with another similar place, and then give one of each pair the new voter ID rules and see how they work out. But the government did not do that.Code of ConductInstall our AppsWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPresident Vladimir Putin meets with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in Sochi, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Supporters of opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan protest in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia.

which allows goods to be shipped all around the EU as long as they clear customs in one participating country.The countries sit down and decide to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union.Britains membership of the customs union stops us negotiating free trade agreements with other countries.But leaving could cause problems with the Irish border and for certain sectors of industry.Leaving would lead to mandatory customs checks for every lorry from Britain to the EU until a free trade deal is struck with Brussels.Theresa May has long been clear that she will seek to leave the single market and the Customs Union - allowing Britain to escape the authority of Brussels and strike its own global trade deals.She is keen to draw up a bespoke trade deal with the EU, allowing for the free flow of goods and services while cracking down on European immigration.EU leaders warned the UK cannot access the single market whilst also capping immigration on people from its member states.The Prime Minister announced that Britain would leave the customs union after rumours of Breixteer coup to install Boris Johnson as Prime Minister with Michael Gove as his deputy and Mr Rees-Mogg as Chancellor swirled around Westminster.A No 10 source said: “To put this to rest, we are categorically leaving the customs union.When grilled on whether her exit negotiation demands will include staying in the free trade area, Theresa May told Sky News in January 2017: “We’re leaving, we’re coming out.But we will get the best possible deal for trading with and operating within the single market.”At a speech in Florence on 22 September 2017, Mrs May said Britain will no longer be a member of the EU Single Market or customs union.On 8 December, the EU and UK confirmed there had been a breakthrough in talks after frenzied late night discussions.Speaking following the announcement the UK and EU had agreed to progress talks to the next stage, Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, made a number of references to the Single Market.He said: The UK has asked for a transition of about two years, while remaining part of the Single Market and Customs Union.We will be ready to discuss this, but naturally, we have our conditions.Tusk and the EU want the UK to respect:Parliament approved the Brexit bill on May 13, 2017, - allowing Prime Minister Theresa May to trigger the formal process of leaving the EU.Brexit divorce talks began in June following the General Election.The Chancellor Philip Hammond, who wanted Britain to remain in the EU, has suggested it could take up to six years for the UK to complete negotiations.Business leaders want to continue accessing European markets after Brexit and are in talks with Brexit secretary David Davis.If Britain leaves the single market and customs union, it may not be given the same complete freedom to move money, people and products around the EU.The European Union will only allow the UK to be part of the European single market if it continues to allow EU nationals the right to live and work in the UK.And being a member of the customs union could stop us striking free trade deals with other nations.After the Prime Minister confirmed the UK would be leaving the lucrative Single Market trading system, the pound slumped to its lowest level since October.It fell a cent against the dollar after trading opened, and was also trading down against the euro at 1.15.But Britain has threatened the EU with a mountain of red tape if it refuses to sign a trade deal with the country post-Brexit.The government said they are planning to bring in new laws to make sure we have our own VAT and customs system in place by March 2019 – in case a deal with the EU is not reached.Theresa May and Olly Robbins, her chief Brexit adviser from the Civil Service, have floated the idea of a scheme which would see Britain continue to collect tariffs on behalf of the EU for goods which enter the UK which are destined for member states.However this plan is understood to have been quashed by Brexiteers in Cabinet.Labour are campaigning to remain in the customs union after Brexit while negotiating a new arrangement.After months of muddled uncertainty, Jeremy Corbyn announced in February 2018 that his party would back the move.Labour wants to see Britain in a bloc where goods and services can move across EU borders without hindrance.But it is likely to stop Britain being able to negotiate its own deals with the rest of the world.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC: We all want to do bold new trade agreements but wed be better off doing that with the EU.Mr Corbyn said he wants a new and strong relationship with the EU single market that includes tariff-free access.But Labour Leaver Frank Field MP said the U-turn would rat on the peoples decision to leave."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/appgrab5.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"get all our great stories the way you want them with our new mobile app","story":"With an amazing new facelift, the new Sun Mobile app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own app.  Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere else.So if youre after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you and your friends, all the goings on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, and the juiciest real life or lifestyle features, look no further.And even more exciting new features will be following soon.All the latest UK and international news -

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown.Around 42 per cent of the seats being contested this year are in London, where all 32 boroughs have elections.Pollsters say London is now a Labour city with large numbers of young people and ethnic minorities.One borough Labour will be hoping to nick from the Tories is Kensington and Chelsea, where council leaders faced fury over the Grenfell Tower disaster.However the Tories have a 24-seat majority so a huge swing would be required for the authority to change hands.Labour are also targeting Barnet - which has been Tory since the 1960s - as well as Conservative strongholds Westminster and Wandsworth, and will hope to extend majorities in other boroughs they already hold.The Lib Dems are hopeful of keeping hold of Sutton, their last London council, and hope to seize Kingston from the Tories.Outside London, Labour is defending 75 councils and aims to gain control of more in towns and cities across England.That will be a key test of national opinion after Jeremy Corbyns surprisingly strong result in the 2017 general election.Ones to watch out for include Amber Valley, Trafford, Swindon and Tamworth which are all narrowly held by the Conservatives.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.The demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that back Brexit.The Tories are seven short of a majority in unpredictable Thurrock, where 17 Ukip councillors all quit the party and are standing as independents.Theresa Mays party are also targeting Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth, where they lost control after a by-election last year.In London, Labour is on course for the best results by any party for 40 years, according to the latest YouGov survey for Queen Mary University of London.In Westminster the YouGov survey for The Times on May 2 shows 42 per cent of residents intend to vote for the Conservatives, 4 per cent more than those preparing to vote Labour.Jeremy Corbyns party has slipped three points since February but still leads the Conservatives by 51 per cent to 29 per cent.However Labour already dominate in London councils after large gains in 2014 and it is uncertain if the 22-point lead will be enough for them to snatch their target councils.They are forecast to remain runners-up in Westminster and Wandsworth.And though the stats predict a win in Tory stronghold Barnet, a large Jewish population could yet reject the party over the anti-Semitism scandal.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.He said the Tories could pick up councils in key Leave-voting areas such as Peterborough, Rugby, Basildon and Pendle.He said: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even if they have lost more seats in London.”In 2014 Labour, then led by Ed Miliband, gained 200 councillors and six councils, meaning they have more to lose and gains will be more difficult.Party elections boss Andrew Gwynne has admitted they wont get the massive boost that had been predicted until recently.This year some areas will see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Scotland Yard is investigating 65 allegations of voting corruption in London, The Sun revealed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jh-graphic-p10-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"we dont need a customs union","story":"Behind closed doors in government and Parliament, two fierce battles are raging, and both are about Britain’s future trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.The first is about the decision ministers must make on the future customs relationship we establish with Europe after Brexit. The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The disdain they had for me, and the ownership of me because I’m black and a woman and a Muslim.She is one of many young people who are defying the Corbynista trend - saying the leftie Labour boss has made them LESS likely to support the party, even as he attracts thousands of youth voters with his radical message.Even diehard Labour supporters say theyve been pushed away, disgusted by the partys extreme foreign policy, runaway spending plans and anti-Semitism crisis.Sam Stopp, 27, has been a Labour councillor for four years - but is now thoroughly disillusioned by Mr Corbyns leadership.He told The Sun: It’s got to a point now that’s completely toxic, and there’s no way back for the forces of sanity in the party.The thing that really sped up the decision was anti-Semitism - it’s so detestable what’s going on at every level of the party.When you’re going to bed every night worrying about the party you’re in, it’s not a great situation.Not only is he not standing for re-election in Brent, West London at tomorrows council election - he has resigned from the party altogether.While some ex-Labour types initially gave Mr Corbyn the benefit of the doubt - Nimco said she kind of liked him when he took over - others were turned off from the moment he became leader.Edinburgh-based student Robbie Travers, 21, said: I resigned on the day Corbyn became leader.I’ve always been a supporter of the Blairite wing of the Labour party - that wing no longer exists.He told The Sun he was disturbed by Mr Corbyns foreign policy stance, including supporting the Kremlins line on the Salisbury poisoning and Syria chemical attack.Robbie also said he was outraged by the growth of anti-Semitism - admitting that the downside of no longer being a Labour member is that he cant fight for the rights of Jewish activists from the inside.Ms Ali, who moved to Cardiff as a child after fleeing Somalia with her family, said she fears Labour has a passive-aggressive attitude towards entrepreneurial ethnic minorities.She told The Sun: It’s the passive-aggressive racism of ‘stay poor, stay black’ - someone like me really baffles them. Being on the centre ground really freaks them out.How are you going to deliver better services when you’re driving out people who create wealth? They still think that the biggest issue is about keeping the jobs down the mines!None of those who spoke to us can bring themselves to vote Labour next time around - saying theyll back whichever party can keep Mr Corbyn out of power.Nimco - who joined Labour when Gordon Brown was leader - said: I’m happy to back the Tory party to keep Corbyn and his Shadow Cabinet out of power.The Labour party doesn’t represent the people that it says it speaks for. I want them to change - but there’s no hope for them.Robbie added: I would actively vote Conservative at elections to undermine Corbyn’s Labour party.I think Jeremy Corbyn is very much a red line in terms of ever supporting the Labour party again.And Sam - despite being a Labour official until recently - concluded: I would have to vote against Labour because it comes down to a choice between party and country. I really think the Labour party is an enemy of the state at the moment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403025806.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"statue man giant penis antwerp middelheim museum","story":"Locals are said to have given officials a hard time after the artwork was erected in the park of the Middelheim Museum in the Belgian city of Antwerp.The statue, called Arc de Triomphe, depicts a naked man bent backwards in a sort of crab position with his manhood brazenly pointing skyward.It is hoped the statue, which is made from plasticine, will be turned into a fountain, but it’s not clear just where the water will come out of.Museum director Sara Weyns said: I determine that nude bodies can indeed touch visitors.We do have quite a lot of nude bodies in our collection, but those are often womens bodies.Apparently those evoke less outrage than this piece.Of course this is a work made from plasticine and not from bronze, which makes it a lot more real-looking. I assume that is why the reactions are quite stronger.Many locals are thought to have complained and made some pretty stiff objections to the eye-catching sculpture, made by the Austrian art collective Getlitin.The piece is part of an exhibition called Antwerp Baroque 2018: Rubens Inspires which opens at the start of June.The exhibition refers to one of Antwerps most famous sons, the baroque master painter Peter Paul Rubens who is known for his nudes of voluptuous women.The museum invited 16 artists to submit art which was inspired by baroque landscaping elements."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000329463722.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"local elections 2018 results winners announced polls close","story":"If you are planning to stay up all night and watch the results as they come in, weve got everything you need to know right here.Local election polls opened on Thursday at 7am to allow some keen voters to get their vote done and dusted before heading off to work.Polling stations stayed open until 10pm the same evening, after which the long night of counting begins.Woking, Gosport, Bromley, Watford or Swindon took part in a trial scheme which required voters to bring ID.The majority of councils will start counting overnight so once the polls shut the first election results should be coming out within a matter of hours.However, some councils may wait to start counting on Friday daytime, leaving voters in suspense all night and most of the day.Unlike the general election, there is no single exit poll which gets announced as soon as polls close.This years local elections are set to be a watched carefully for an indication on how Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyns parties are faring in the public opinion.Last year, Labour saw many red councils lost to their Conservative rivals - something they will be looking to gain back today.In London one of the key councils to watch is Barnet, North London - a former Tory stronghold which currently has 1 seat difference between the two major parties.Its been identified as a potential Labour swing seat, but with a large Jewish population it may see the antisemitism row within Labour cost Jeremy a relatively easy target.Other key targets in for Labour are Wandsworth, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Trafford and Swindon according to latest predictions.For the Conservatives, key councils include booting the Lib Dems out of Sutton, their council left in the country, Thurrock in Essex, Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth.1amThe fastest council to declare at 1am is expected to be Sunderland, a Labour stronghold, which has announced its results first for six years.Its thought Conservative safe seat Broxbourne wont be far behind and declare at around 1am.The first Labour-Tory battleground to declare it expected to be Swindon where Labour need just four seats to knock the Conservative majority and take control of the council.Experts predict Nuneaton \u0026amp Bedworth, Sefton, Cannock Chase, Bury, Basildon, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, Castle Point, Halton, Harlow, South Tyneside, Tameside, West Oxfordshire, and Exeter will also declare around 1am.1.30amPrestwich in Bury is expected to declare at around 1.30am and will be the first wards to show if there has been a swing away from Labour by its large Jewish population after the antisemitism scandal that has rocked Labour.2amWestminster is expected to declare between 2 and 2.30am as Conservative despite the seat being ferociously targeted by Labour -if they managed to catch the council itll be the first time a red majority will have held Westminster since its formation.Also forecast to announce are Trafford, Peterborough, Amber Valley, Oxford, St Albans, Chorley, Epping Forest, Fareham, Hard, Hartlepool, Kingston-upon-Hull, North Herfordshire, Oldham, Preston, Rochdale, Rochford, Salford, Tamworth, Wirral, Wolverhampton, Worcester, Carlisle, Lincoln, Stevenage, Stockport, West Lancashire, and Wigan.3amWe can expect to see the first of the capitals mayoral result from Tower Hamlets - it isnt expected to be a guaranteed Labour win as a candidate for the Peoples Alliance of Tower Hamlets has mounted a fierce opposition against current Labour mayor John Biggs.Whoever wins the race for Tower Hamlets mayor will select their cabinet from the councillors elected in tonights vote which isnt expected to be declared for another five hours.Labour target Wandsworth is also expected to declare at 3am with their supporters anxiously looking on to see if they have taken it from the Conservatives.The other councils expected to declare are Sheffield, Dudley, Plymouth, Southend-on-Sea, Liverpool, Barking \u0026amp Dagenham, Hammersmith \u0026amp Fulham, North East Lincolnshire, Basingstoke \u0026amp Dean, Brentwood, Colchester, Eastleigh, Gosport, Havant, Rushmoor, Sandwell, St Helens, Tandridge, Waltham Forest, Cheltenham, Coventry, and Rugby.4amWe will see results from marginal council Barnet, hotly contested between both Labour and Conservatives as the last election saw the council stay blue by two seats.Its been targeted strongly by Labour but it is home to the largest Jewish population in the country who may help it remain a Conservative stronghold and out of Corbyns grasp.Lib Dem targeted Richmond-upon-Thames will also be declaring. It was a strong Conservative hold last time, but with the large number of EU remain voters living there it may become the Lib Dems second council in the country - assuming they hold onto Sutton which will be declaring almost an hour later.Also forecast to declare are Hillingdon, Reading, Walsall, Bradford, Portsmouth, Bolton, Ipswich, Slough, Wakefield, Wokingham, Daventry, Welwyn Hatfield.5amKensington and Chelsea, the most unpredictable result in the election, is expected to be declared at 5am  - in the wake of Labours recent general election there it is thought the council may turn red.However, staunch Tory supporters in the south of the borough may help them keep the council blue despite anger over the handling of the Grenfell disaster.UKIPs electoral clout will be put to the test in Thurrock which saw the party gain 17 councillors last time round - only for them all to quit en masse to form a new group denouncing party politics.Its expected to remain under Conservative control, but has had no majority party since Labour in 2012.Sutton will also be announcing their results and eyes will be watching to see if the Lib Dems retain their only council.Also expected to declare are Bexley, Southampton, Leeds, Winchester, Brent, and Cambridge.6amElection results start to quieten down with only Ealing and Derby expected to declare.Political reps will be gearing up for the final hours of TV battles and debates on breakfast television.7amCroydon, Redbridge, Camden, Southwark, and Tower Hamlets council are expected to declare.8amPolitical machines get whirring as voters sit down for breakfast to see Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis and Labour elections chief Andrew Gwynne battle it out on the silver screen.Its thought Merton and Greenwhich will declare around 8am.Theres expected to be around 50 of the 150 councils left to declare.12pmA big break is expected between 8am and 12pm before the next lot of declarations come in.First up in the afternoon is expected to be the Lewisham and Watford mayor results and Bromley council.1pmMore counts will be in from Calderdale, Solihull, Great Yarmouth, Burnley, Gateshead, Kirklees, and Milton Keynes.Also expected to be declared is the Newham mayor.2pmThe first of the metro mayors is expected to be declared in Sheffield.The councils declaring are thought to be Maidstone, Crawley, Hyndburn, Norwhich, Knowsley, North Tyneside, Rossendale, Runnymead, Hounslow, and Wyre Forest.3pmExpected to declare are Three Rivers, Hastings, Hackney mayor, Tunbridge Wells, Pendle, Adur, Barnsley, Craven, Harrogate, Huntingdonshrie, Mole Valley, Worthing, and Cherwell.4pmStragglers are still coming through with their counts late into the afternoon - in fact theres another estimate two hours before all the councils declare.Expected to announce results are Newcastle-under-Lyme, Harrow, Harringey, Watford, Blackburn with Darwen, Elmbridge, Reigate \u0026amp Barnstead.5pmDeclaring with an hour to go until all results are expected to be in are Kingston-upon-Thames, Newham, Lewisham, South Cambridge, and Woking.6pmAnd the FINAL results are in with South Lakeland, Birmingham, Manchester, Islington, Lambeth, and Hackeny being the last councils expected to declare.With that its all over, the political battle to gain new territory and snatch back old councils will have come to an end.We might even have an idea of what to expect when the next general election comes round in 2022. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its shocking. This is a nonsense scheme theyre putting in place.Angela Wilkins, leader of the Labour group in Bromley, said five people have been unable to vote and that the scheme is also causing long delays, tweeting: So why are we doing this?And Ellie Reeves, Labour MP for Lewisham West and Penge, posted: Just been to vote. Was informed that two people had already turned up without ID this morning so had been unable to vote.Very worrying and backs up all the evidence that the voter ID pilot in Bromley is plain wrong.Finnegan Pope-Carter and his wife Dr Chrys Harris were both refused when they arrived to vote in Shipley, near Bradford this morning, which isnt even part of the voter ID trial.Were you turned away from a polling station today because you didn’t have the right ID? We want to hear from you – contact Emma Glanfield on emma.glanfield@thesun and tell us your storyHe was eventually allowed to vote after fetching his driving licence from his car, but, Dr Harris was refused multiple times.She said: “I didnt have my polling card or a photo ID on me. I told them repeatedly that I did not need them either. They refused and said I did.”Adding: “I stood my ground and finally they rang a superior who said I was allowed a ballot.”In response a spokesman for Bradford Council said: “We apologise to the very small number of voters concerned who were asked to provide ID to vote in one Shipley polling station today.“We were alerted to the matter early this morning and it was dealt with immediately.“To confirm, there is no requirement for voters to provide ID to cast a vote and a further message has been issued to all polling staff.Labour councillor Tahir Aziz said a man was turned away from voting at a polling station on Walton Road in Woking because his form of ID, a Surrey County Council document with his picture on it, was not accepted.He said: This gentleman turned up, showed his ID which included a picture that was clearly him, it was an exact resemblance, but they wouldnt accept it as it was not on the list of acceptable forms of ID.He was fuming. He was furious. He is a British national and he couldnt vote.It is having an impact on certain people being disenfranchised by this trial.Brits will cast their ballots in 156 areas across the country today, to vote in councillors, local mayors and one MP in Northern Ireland.The local elections will be the latest sign of whether Mrs May or Jeremy Corbyn is in the political driving seat, one year on from the General Election where the PM lost her majority.Today the presiding officer at a polling station in Bromley said only a very small percentage of voters had forgotten or were unable to provide ID.The man, who did not wish to be named, said residents had received five pieces of information explaining the change in the rules, including leaflets and a note with their polling cards.Normally people only had to walk into a polling station and give their name and address to vote, which the Government said was open to voter fraud.The Prime Ministers spokesperson said this afternoon that the overwhelming majority of people are casting their vote without a problem.In the trial areas residents now have to bring with them photo ID, which ministers say will improve the security and the resilience of the electoral system that underpins our democracy.Voters have been told to bring their polling card, or photo ID such as a driving licence or passport. Watford will accept a valid credit or debt card, and Working will accept a bus pass.Gosport and Bromley require a poll card or TWO forms of ID, including one with your address on it.The new plans have been criticised by opposition parties, campaigners and charities, with Electoral Reform Society calling it deeply flawed.And Labour’s shadow minister Cat Smith said today’s issues were “proof that voter ID has no place in our democracy”.Hazel Walters, a resident of Bromley since 1983, said: Its absurd. I think it will discriminate against people.“Not everyones got a passport, a driving licence and all of that. I think people will be disenfranchised.”In response an Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: Returning Officers administering the elections in the pilot areas have run awareness campaigns to inform voters of what form of identification they need to bring in order to be able to vote.We encourage anyone who has queries about the pilots to contact their local councils electoral services department.“Polling stations are open until 10pm.Both parties have suffered bad publicity in recent weeks, as the Government has been criticised over the Windrush scandal and Labour struggles to tackle anti-Semitism.So the two leaders will both be keen to put in a strong performance at the polls this week, with 4,370 seats up for grabs.The polls opened at 7am and will close at 10pm, although if there’s a queue at the polling station you can still vote after 10 as long as you arrived before the deadline.This year some areas will also see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Heres how to find out who is running in your area.It’s likely to be a good night for Labour, since they tend to do better in urban areas than the Tories.Labour are targeting boroughs in the capital including Barnet - which has been a Tory council since the 1960s - as well as strongholds in Wandsworth and Westminster.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.And the demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that back Brexit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403200662.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tesco waitrose merger supermarket lorry cab trailer hgv","story":"But could two more supermarkets be about to follow suit?Well, that’s what some have joked after a Tesco lorry was spotted pulling a Waitrose trailer yesterday.The unlikely alliance took place in Godalming, Surrey.It’s understood the Tesco driver came to the aid of the Waitrose lorry after it broke down - leaving its trailer blocking a road.Photos of the scene sparked much mirth after they were shared on Facebook.One user wrote: “Are Tesco and Waitrose merging?

Every Little Helps.It comes as the deal between Sainsbury’s and Asda triggered fears it will lead to pricier groceries, store closures and job losses.The proposed deal would see them leapfrog Tesco to become the UKs biggest chain.Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey warned it risks squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further.She said in the absence of proper vetting by regulators, it would be British shoppers that suffer from rising prices and British workers that may be fearing for their jobs.The two chains are the second and third largest grocery retailers in the UK.

They were journalists, murdered on the job as they tried to report on the details of an earlier bombing.On the same day, BBC reporter was shot dead in the countrys eastern Khost province, marking the day out as the the deadliest day for journalists since the Charlie Hebdo massacre in 2015.It makes it all the more poignant that today is World Press Freedom Day, a date to celebrate the principles of press freedom and defend reporters around the world from attacks like these.Without a free press, its impossible to hold the powerful to account, expose injustices and fight for justice on the issues affecting ordinary people.And the world would become a far more confusing place without the reporters who dedicate their lives to unearthing the truth and sharing it with us all.Compared to countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, where journalists are routinely killed or jailed, it may seem like we have little use for Press Freedom day in the UK.But the sad truth is that there are major issues with press freedom close to home as well.Last month, Reporters Without Borders released its Press Freedom Index - a record of how free the media in each country is, based on the threat of government clampdowns and intimidation by journalists.Staggeringly, the UK came 40th out of 180 countries - worse than every other Western European nation apart from Italy.Best five countriesNotable othersWhen the index began in 2002, the UK ranked 22nd - but since then our position in the freedom league table has plummeted.This is partly due to the threats of Parliaments Data Protection Bill, which would force tougher rules on the press and give the state more power to regulate and ultimately muzzle the media.Another problem for press freedom in the UK is the general “climate of hostility towards the media”, which has seen British journalists threatened and intimidated online just for doing their job.Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, has received so much online abuse that she was assigned her own bodyguard last year.In other countries, like Afghanistan, press freedom is under threat from bombs and bullets as well as from the government and social media.On Monday, a bomb went off during rush hour in Kabul, and journalists in the city rushed to the scene so they could cover the story.But an ISIS fighter arrived at the site of the blast with them, disguised as a reporter.He joined the crowd of journalists on the scene and detonated - hammering home the warning that an official press vest can mark reporters out as targets, rather than affording them any protection.These deaths bring the total number of journalists killed so far this year to 24.In 2017, the total stood at 82, with 13 journalists killed in Mexico, 12 in Afghanistan and 11 in Iraq - the three most dangerous places to be a journalist.The years total was the lowest tally since 2007, according to the International Federation of Journalists, but it is still 82 too many.Elsewhere in the world, journalists still face the threat of being locked up for the crime of exposing the truth.Last year, 262 journalists were arrested - the highest number in almost three decades.Turkey is the worst offender, with 73 journalists currently behind bars, while 41 journalists have been imprisoned in China and 20 in Egypt.Its a sign that, on World Press Freedom Day, we have a long way to go and hard battles to fight before journalists around the world can be free to do their jobs without fear.But today is also a day to be thankful for the brave reporters who rush selflessly into danger armed with only their cameras and notebooks.And it is a day to remember all the journalists who have already given their lives in pursuit of a story. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tenants across the country should not be stung by unexpected costs.That’s why we’re delivering our promise to ban letting fees, alongside other measures to make renting fairer and more transparent.But the Bill is not set to become law for at least another year, meaning thousands of renters will have to pay an extra £233 on average in the meantime.And charities today raised concerns that loopholes in the legislation could still be slapped on through the back door.Dan Wilson Craw, Director of Generation Rent, said today: “There is a risk that not all tenants will be protected thanks to an exemption that could let some landlords continue to charge fees on spurious grounds and will be hard to police properly. This potential loophole should be taken out of the legislation.“And setting the cap on deposits at six weeks’ rent leaves in place a big barrier to moving home. The government needs to look at how to reduce the burden of this, for example by allowing the transfer of deposits between tenancies.”Britains chronic housing shortage is the second most important issue to the public, new studies have said.Theresa May has vowed to fix Britains broken housing market, vowing more new homes and ripping up planning rules which slow building down.She says she wants to build more homes more quickly and promised to ease the misery of millions of private renters too.Earlier this month she insisted that renters must be treated like human beings and said she would protect them from cowboy agents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was more than a courtier and much more than a friend.He danced with her. He joked with her. He served her and guided her. And when her marriage hit a rocky patch, he comforted her.In her 92 years, no other man has ever been that close to the Queen, apart from Prince Philip.In 1975, when bachelor Plunket died from liver cancer aged just 51, the Queen was plunged into grief.Breaching all protocol, she ordered a royal funeral for him at St James’s Palace. Again, she broke precedent by attending his memorial service.Then she ordered that a memorial temple should be built to him in Windsor Great Park. She had a hand in its design and chose the flowers to be planted around it.Many times since Plunket’s death, when the Queen has gone to watch polo at nearby Smith’s Lawn, she has slipped away to sit, alone, beside the white-painted colonnaded temple built in her friend’s name in the park’s beautiful Valley Gardens.Nobody ever mentions these visits — nobody ever has — as the grief is too private.Such behaviour from a monarch who has spent a lifetime shielding her emotions from her subjects is unprecedented. But then, as Elizabeth was to confess herself, there was nobody to equal Patrick Plunket.They had been friends since childhood. But when Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1952, aged 25, the relationship changed . . . and deepened.Patrick’s father, Irish peer Lord Plunket, had been a close friend of Elizabeth’s parents, then the Duke and Duchess of York.Plunket’s mother Dorothé was a half-American heiress and the couple were worldly and sophisticated members of the international set.But when Patrick was just 15 they died in a plane crash and he inherited the family title.In World War Two he served in the Irish Guards, then became an equerry for Elizabeth’s father, King George VI. When Elizabeth became queen, she appointed him Deputy Master of the Household.As such he masterminded the Queen’s banquets and State receptions, as well as the Royal Ascot house parties. He revelled in it, loving nothing more than to please and surprise his royal boss.As they discussed menus, guest lists and ways to keep boring guests at arm’s length, they became closer.Plunket’s cousin, Lady Annabel Goldsmith — mother of Jemima — said: “He adored her from the outset.“They enjoyed a very special connection. He was the one member of her staff who could talk to her on equal terms.“There was an openness and honesty between them based on respect, friendship — and a lot of teasing.”But the relationship was more than that. In 1956, when Prince Philip disappeared off on a world tour for four months on the royal yacht Britannia, Plunket provided a shoulder for the Queen to lean on, helping her through the lonely days and weeks.The royal marriage had reached a crisis point. Prince Philip had devoted himself to rejuvenating the monarchy and to selflessly serving the wife he loved, but there were impossible pressures on him.Yet the reforms that Philip sought in the Palace and beyond were often turned aside or ignored.“I’m just a bloody amoeba,” he complained, implying he was only there to father the next monarch — and nothing more.Philip’s 1956 tour seemed endless, and nobody seemed to know when he would come home. Questions were asked in the House of Commons.Reports started appearing in the American press of a serious rift in the royal marriage and rumours came back from Australasia of girls and parties aboard the Britannia.It was hastily arranged for the Queen to meet her husband in Lisbon, Portugal, before he returned home. And perhaps in a moment of panic, worrying that she might lose him, she made Philip a Prince of the United Kingdom — until then he had been only a Greek prince.At Windsor, Plunket continued to hold the Queen’s hand throughout the crisis. Lady Goldsmith said: “He was tall, impeccably dressed, with a voice full of merriment and his eyes crinkled up with laughter. He radiated an irrepressible sense of fun.”Philip finally came home and the royal marriage was rekindled.There had been a ten-year gap between the birth of Princess Anne and their next child, Prince Andrew — but things were back on track. If Philip had had an itch, it had been well and truly scratched.And yet there was still a need for Patrick Plunket by the Queen’s side.Her biographer, Sarah Bradford, said: “While Philip was off dancing with one of his women friends, Plunket would whirl Elizabeth on to the floor.“He’d notice at parties if she was looking lonely, scoop her up and dance with her, always there if she looked a bit lonely.”Royal biographer Charles Higham added: “He was slender, handsome, with thinning, dark hair and aristocratic profile. The Queen was very fond of him, very probably in love with him.”Historian Sir Roy Strong added: “He was one of the few who could give the Queen a glimpse of the world outside.”Plunket was not just playful, he was practical too. When the Queen discovered she needed a tiara for a formal occasion and found the Buckingham Palace safe was locked, he raced away and came back with a Plunket family heirloom.When she visited his house — a rare honour for a royal servant, however lordly — she teased him for looking “like a dentist” in the expensive portrait he had recently commissioned from artist Graham Sutherland.They laughed together a lot, especially during those crisis years. And even when he was terminally ill, he struggled from his sickbed to attend one last formal duty at Buckingham Palace, numbed by morphine as he tied his bow tie.That night, the Queen and her adoring courtier knew it would be the last time they would meet.Weeks later, at his memorial service at the Guards Chapel, his cousin Lady Goldsmith glanced at the Queen and “caught a look of deep sadness”.For the only time in her life, Her Majesty had a hand in writing an obituary for The Times, stressing Plunket’s unselfish service and duty.The article made it sound as though his service was for the whole Royal Family — but its meaning was clear to those who had witnessed Elizabeth and Plunket laughing together.A year after his death, with the position still vacant, a courtier asked the Queen who would replace him as Deputy Master of the Royal Household. She answered: “No one will ever replace him.”And so to the questions many people will be asking — was the Queen ever tempted? Was she unfaithful to Prince Philip, a man who has never quite escaped the swirl and fog of gossip about his own private life?Did Her Majesty succumb to the charms and handsome good looks of the 7th Lord Plunket?Royal biographer Robert Lacey, doesn’t think so. He said: “Opinions vary on Plunket’s sexuality,” and he quoted a fellow Guards officer who said: “He was one of those lucky characters who was just neutral.”But Charles Higham has a different take.

Perhaps one could stop posing for a photo and pop round to help a non- famous tax-paying crime victim.”She added: “And here am I doing the job of police, making door-to-door enquiries with my neighbours to find clues.”Mercedes-driving Wrighty had his motor stolen in Brent hours after the raid.It was used in an arson attack before being found.James Price, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “It’s not right that taxpayers have crimes left uninvestigated because police want to pose with footballers.”A Scotland Yard spokesman said: “These are separate incidents with different investigative opportunities.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They invited me in  and suddenly they didn’t want me any more.“Britain let me down. But I am so happy to see my family again and so grateful to everyone who helped bring me home.”Her great granddaughter Kia Jones, 17, wiped away tears  as she held her  hand at the airport while grandson Shelumiel, eight, met her for the first time.Gretel came to Britain in the 1960s and met her late husband Lloyd George on the boat from the West Indies.But like many of the Windrush generation she never applied for a British passport.Instead, she had a stamp on her Jamaican passport granting her indefinite leave to remain.This document was stolen during a burglary at her home in Brixton, South London, in 2006.She travelled to Jamaica on a new passport in 2009 but  bungling bureaucrats refused her permission to return.This left Gretel  trapped abroad with no access to health care for conditions including diabetes.Grandson Aaron Burdon, 30, said: “My nan is sick,  has no money and no home because that was taken away from her.“She needs  support from the Government.

As many people headed to the polls for the local elections, some with visual, physical or cognitive impairments may not have been able to cast an independent, secret ballot - as required by the Human Rights Act 1998.If you or someone you know has encountered difficulties in casting their vote, please email our technology reporter at aj.martin@sky.uk with the phrase \"Disabled Voter Access\" in the subject."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-front-pages-national-newspapers_4300146.jpg?20180503220258 ","title":"pakistan may have endured the hottest april temperature ever recorded on earth","story":"Weather expert Christopher Burt told the Washington Post it was probably also the highest April temperature \"reliably observed on Earth in modern records\".He dismissed a previous record of 51C (123.8F) set in Santa Rosa, Mexico in April 2001 as having \"dubious reliability\".The World Meteorological Organisation does not publish monthly reviews of extreme temperatures around the world but it did confirm Nawabshah had recorded its highest April temperature.\"In late April, the heat extended over a much larger area and peaked on 29 and 30 April when many records were set over large parts of Sindh Province,\" an article on its website read.\"The last day of April happened to be the hottest day on record when PMD (Pakistan Meteorological Department) site Shaheed Benazirabad (Nawabshah) recorded its April ever recorded highest temperature of 50.2C.\"The Dawn newspaper reported dozens had fainted after suffering heatstroke on Monday and described the weather as \"unbearable\".Two teenagers had reportedly drowned as they tried to cool off in a canal while labourers and motorcyclists were among the worst affected by heatstroke.Pakistan Today reported of power cuts which added to the misery for those trying to stay cool.Guinness World Records credits the highest recorded temperature on the planet to Death Valley in the United States, which witnessed 56.7C (134.1F) in July 1913."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-ballot-box-polling-station_4292955.jpg?20180426115922 ","title":"people barred from voting in areas piloting id trials","story":"The man, who did not want to be named, said people in the borough had been sent five pieces of information alerting them to the impending changes, including leaflets and a note with their polling cards.He added: \"Voters always have the choice to go home and get some ID.\"Labour\u0027s Ellie Reeves, MP for Lewisham West, said two people were turned away from voting on Thursday morning because they did not have ID.She tweeted: \"Just been to vote.
