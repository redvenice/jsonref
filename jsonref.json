Photograph: EPAAndy RainA British government minister has accepted that “further dialogue” is required with the Irish government over a controversial US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed changes to immigration laws.During a debate in the House of Lords on Monday prior to a vote, the planned pre-travel clearance checks for those entering Northern Ireland were branded “unworkable”, with members urging the UK Lords Minister, Susan Williams (Baroness Williams of Trafford) to “make concessions”.Responding to criticism about lack of communication with the Irish Government and tourist chiefs, she said: “We do accept the need for further dialogue with interlocuters including the Irish government, Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland. I totally accept that point.”Last Tuesday, Westminster MPs voted to reinstate the proposal for an electronic waiver following an amendment by the House of Lords to exempt Northern Ireland from the new legislation. The day after the Commons challenge, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said as far as he was concerned, it had not been finalised. He described the decision as “regrettable”.Coming under the British government’s Nationalities and Borders Bill, the proposal will require EU citizens who are not Irish will to apply online for pre-travel clearance -known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into the North.Addressing the Lords on Monday after submitting an amendment, Paul Murphy (Baron Murphy of Torfaen) said he was “hopeful the Minister would have spoken to her colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and would have made some concessions on this”. “But the dead hand of the Home Office is there again,” he added.The former Northern Ireland Secretary of State said he was “troubled” by the introduction of an ETA, at a cost of €14, saying it would severely impact on tourism, cross-border health services and the “spirit of the Good Friday Agreement” .“Is it really worth jeopardising our (BritishIrish) relationship which is bad enough as it is over the last number of years by this petty and silly proposal by the government...I hope the government will change its mind but I’m not hopeful.”The planned change to the law will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.Former SDLP leader Margaret Richie also expressed her opposition, saying the ETA scheme was “unworkable”.“It is unenforceable and would violate the very premise of reconciliation in terms of the Good Friday Agreement,” she told the Lords.She asked the UK minister to “consider the geography” of Border towns and villages, saying: “I believe the Home Office hasn’t fully considered that.” “There’s one village that straddles both Donegal and Fermanagh, that is the small village of Pettigo where that Border goes straight down the middle.“Within one minute you could be in the Republic of Ireland and the next minute, you could be in Northern Ireland.” She queried what discussions had taken with the Irish Government as well tourism organisations.The human rights NGO, the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), has also condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.Baroness Williams — who described herself as “an Irish woman with a father from Northern Ireland” — indicated however that the ETA plan was likely to be passed. “Once the EU’s come into force next year, Ireland will stand out as one of the few countries in Europe without an ETA style pass,” she said.Referring to tourism, she said that “once granted, an ETA will be valid for multiple trips to the UK”, and that the cost is “likely to be small and unlikely to be a deterrent for visitors”.“Moreover, many of the UK’s international partners have taken a similar approach to border security...It is a very familiar concept for travellers,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"coalition to discuss further cost of living measures","story":"Food prices are rising more slowly, but there is concern these increases will continue for some time. File photograph: GettyLeaders of the three Government parties are expected to meet Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath on Monday to discuss further cost of living measures and ways to cut spiralling fuel bills.Surging inflation and the rising cost of fuel is putting intense political pressure on Government to introduce additional measures to mitigate cost of living increases. But Ministers fear a fresh package of supports would soon be overtaken by price increases and Government would have to find further measures – and money to pay for them – before the summer.There is particular focus on home heating oil, the price of which has rocketed in recent months. And there is acute political concern that people will have difficulty paying to heat their homes. Figures published by the Central Statistics Office on Thursday show home heating oil prices increased by 58 per cent in March and have risen by more than 125 per cent since this time last year.Petrol prices have increased by 35 per cent in the last month, while diesel is up 46 per cent. Food prices are rising more slowly, but there is concern these increases will continue for some time.Carbon tax increaseMeanwhile, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Dáil measures to offset the forthcoming increase in carbon tax will be introduced by Government before May.However Mr Varadkar also said a VAT reduction on energy amid the current cost of living crisis is not possible, following engagement with the European Commission by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Mr Donohoe on a potential reduction.Mr Varadkar was speaking during Leaders’ Questions, when Sinn Féin’s Pearse Doherty said the planned increase in the carbon tax, due to come into effect from May 1st, “should not go ahead”.Mr Doherty said an emergency mini-budget was needed amid the cost of living crisis and that the Government “can and must do more”.Sources said subsequently the commission has not yet responded definitively to the Government’s requests. But it is understood the legal situation is that if the Government reduces VAT on fuel temporarily, it would then need to be restored to a higher rate, as the Republic’s special arrangements for low VAT on fuel would end.If the Republic was to be granted a derogation from this rule, it would require all other European Union states to agree – a prospect officials consider unlikely as “every country has their own asks”, said one source. Reducing excise further may be the only way to cut fuel bills, say Government sources."},{"url":null,"title":"holohan confirms watt signed off on his secondment to trinity college","story":"Prof Holohan’s salary will be in excess of regular pay scales for academic professors at the university. File photograph: Julien BehalDepartment of Health Secretary General Robert Watt signed off on the controversial secondment of Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Tony Holohan to a new job at Trinity College Dublin (TCD).Dr Holohan confirmed Mr Watt’s role as he also told a private meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Health that he himself had an involvement in developing the academic post. Meanwhile, The  has learned it was the Department of Health that first approached TCD over a potential role for Dr Holohan at the university in recent months.There is considerable anger within Government over how the appointment was handled, with much of it directed at Mr Watt. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly - who was not aware of the secondment arrangement until this week - has asked Mr Watt for a report on the matter. In the Dáil, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said it would have been “far preferable” if the full details of Dr Holohan’s secondment had been put into the public domain at the outset.He also said Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath was “not satisfied with how this has been done” and was engaging with the Department of Health.Dr Holohan was announced as the professor of public health strategy and leadership at Trinity on March 25th, but it later emerged the Department of Health would fund the role, continuing to pay Dr Holohan’s annual salary of €187,000.Dr Holohan appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Health on Thursday. He confirmed he does not intend to return to the role of CMO at any point in the future after taking up a new position at TCD.In the opening statement he sent to the committee, Dr Holohan defended the new position saying the third-level sector would play a vital role in meeting the challenge of future pandemics.Sources told the  Dr Holohan told the meeting that his own “fingerprints” were on the development of the role at TCD. His comments came after Sinn Féin spokesman on health David Cullinane had asked him how the role had come about and who signed off on it. Dr Holohan is said to have outlined how he envisaged the role as part of a broader effort to develop the capacity the health service and learn from the lessons of the pandemic. He confirmed that the secretary general of the Department of Health signed off on the secondment, though sources said he did not mention Mr Watt by name.The Department later told The  that the secondment means Dr Holohan has agreed to relinquish his role as CMO and it is not his intention to return to this role at any point in the future.It added: “The Department, at a senior level made this decision in order to show innovation and lead by example. All arrangements in relation to staffing are the responsibility of the Secretary General.”While the Department of Health is understood to have first approached the university about a potential appointment, senior university figures are understood to have been keen to secure his expertise.The university said the processes that facilitated the appointment were “neither unique nor unusual”.“It is feature of academia, in Ireland and globally, that some professorships are paid for by external funding bodies, others are paid for by private enterprise or philanthropic donations,” the university said.“This appointment followed our regular procedures. The university is completely satisfied that the professorship will deliver timely and relevant teaching and research opportunities and that Dr Holohan is ideally placed to make a significant contribution.”Prof Holohan’s salary will be in excess of regular pay scales for academic professors at the university, where salaries range from just over €118,000 to almost €158,000.However, it is below that of top earners in higher education where top academics in key areas of research have been hired on salaries of up to €337,000."},{"url":null,"title":"european parliament backs rule change to ensure flow of medicines to northern ireland","story":"The European Parliament has voted by an overwhelming majority to approve an EU rule change to ensure medicines can continue to flow into Northern Ireland seamlessly from Britain. File photograph: PA WireThe European Parliament has voted by an overwhelming majority to approve an EU rule change to ensure medicines can continue to flow into Northern Ireland seamlessly from Britain under post-Brexit arrangements, in a step pushed for by Irish MEPs.The derogation for Northern Ireland approved by the parliament exempts it indefinitely from requirements on medicines that usually apply within the single market, to avoid any interruption to supply in this regard for the North.It applies to both approved and experimental drugs, and will apply retrospectively from the start of this year when it comes into force imminently.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, part of the EU-UK Brexit withdrawal agreement that guarantees a special post-Brexit trading status for the region, the North is still part of the EU regulatory market for medicines, even though a large proportion of its medicines are supplied from Britain. Irish MEPs and diplomats had lobbied for the rule change to be approved and the step was welcomed.“That means important medicinal products will get to the people who need them and provides greater certainty for Northern Ireland post-Brexit, which is very welcome news indeed.”“Of the issues that bother people about the protocol, the main one is medicines,” he said. “It was a very clear message at a very sensitive time in Northern Irish politics, and I hope the message is really well received in Northern Ireland.”ConsequencesThe change to EU rules, first proposed by the European Commission in December, means that marketing authorisation holders for medicines for Northern Ireland can be located anywhere in the UK, and batch-testing can also take place in Britain.Experimental drugs manufactured in Britain can also be imported into Northern Ireland, as well as into the Republic, Cyprus, and Malta, as long as they meet conditions.The derogation for the Republic, Cyprus, and Malta is for a temporary period of three years.If medicines are given authorisation in the UK before they receive it from the European Medicines Agency, they can still be supplied to Northern Ireland under the rule change, which allows for temporary authorisations in such circumstances.The commission is set to propose a broader revision of EU pharmaceutical rules by the end of this year, which is expected to set out more permanent structural solutions to ensure the security of supply of medicines in general in smaller markets, according to a statement by the European Parliament.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe Russia has expelled two Irish diplomats from the embassy in Moscow in response to Ireland’s expulsion of four Russian diplomats in Dublin last week.The Irish ambassador to Russia, Brian McElduff, was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry in Moscow on Thursday afternoon and told two diplomats had been asked to leave. The Department of Foreign Affairs said there was “no justification” for the move. “The staff at the Embassy of Ireland in Moscow do not have, nor are engaged in, any duties or functions which are incompatible with their diplomatic status,” the department said.“This decision to reduce the size of our relatively small embassy in Moscow will significantly reduce our ability to provide services to our citizens in Russia and to maintain diplomatic channels of communication with the Russian Federation.”The expulsions will reduce the number of Irish diplomats in Moscow to four, including the ambassador. Russia said the Irish diplomats were being asked to leave in response to “unfriendly and groundless steps taken by the Irish authorities” with the expulsion of four staff last month.The Kremlin’s foreign ministry said if Ireland continued its “destructive line” towards Russia, the Government “should not have the slighted doubt about Moscow’s determination to respond proportionately to any hostile steps”.The foreign ministry also demanded the Government “immediately remove the obstacles to the work of the Russian embassy in Dublin and ensure normal conditions for the functioning of our diplomatic mission”, without specifying what this referred to.Speaking on a visit to Romania with members of the EU affairs committee, Fine Gael TD Joe McHugh, the committee’s chairman, said the expulsion of Irish diplomats “will not prevent the Irish people from continuing to support the Ukrainian people in their fight for survival and continue to support sanctions against the Russian aggressors”.Last week Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the four Russian officials were asked to leave because “their activities are not in accordance with the international standards of diplomatic behaviour”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney summoned Russia’s ambassador to Ireland Yuriy Filatov to advise him the four officials had been told by the Government to leave. The move against Ireland’s embassy in Moscow comes amid a series of expulsions of Russian officials from Moscow’s embassies across the European Union and retaliatory actions by the Kremlin as tensions between the West and Russia mount over its invasion of Ukraine.Earlier this week, EU countries expelled more than 200 Russian diplomats and staff for alleged spying or “national security reasons” in a coordinated move earlier that followed international condemnation of the killing of civilians by Russian soldiers in Bucha near Kyiv. Last week, Russia expelled 10 diplomats from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania after the three Baltic states expelled 10 Russian diplomats in a coordinated move earlier in the month. This is the second time in a month Mr McElduff has been summoned to the foreign ministry. He was called in last month after a truck rammed into the gates of its embassy in Rathgar, south Dublin. On that occasion, the foreign ministry demanded an official apology and compensation for the damage caused.

At 18, I’d been prescribed testosterone by a private GP so I could transition to living as a man. The GP didn’t attempt to explore the possible causes of my gender dysphoria, such as my mental health problems or my difficulties fitting in socially. But even if they had, I might have insisted on going ahead anyway. I thought I knew everything about myself – nobody could tell me what to do.  I was raised in Lancashire, in a very masculine environment. My mum used to work nights, so I was looked after by my dad. I also had two stepbrothers, eight years older. I wasn’t brought up with them, but we did socialise as I was growing up. After my parents orced when I was 11, I spent a lot of time with my dad because my mum used to work three jobs.When I started school, I struggled to make friends with other girls. I didn’t care for Groovy Chick, or Barbie or Bratz – I just wanted to play football. There were a lot of social rules to female friendships. Male friendships were just so much easier: we’d fall out, we’d fight, we’d make up, we’d forget about it the next day.High school was a particularly difficult time. When I was about 11, I became convinced I was meant to be a boy. My male friends were all developing differently to me, and in turn that made me feel like I wished I had what they had – they were stronger and more outgoing. On Tumblr and YouTube, I discovered trans people who argued that some people who are meant to be male are accidentally born female. I thought: this is the answer! I was gender dysphoric, I was meant to be born male and there was no other reason why I might not get on with women.At the same time, I began feeling sexually attracted to girls, though later I realised I was bisexual. Aged 12, I developed depression and anxiety. I had a few sessions with a counsellor, who used words such as “borderline”, “bipolar” and “manic”. My parents didn’t really know what to do, and support from the school was minimal. It was my boyfriend, who I met in high school and who is also bisexual, who gave me the most support.To add to my distress, when I was 14 I was sexually abused by a stranger after being groomed online. I told my parents, who reported it to the police. Eventually, the perpetrator was tried and sent to prison. It was a hugely traumatic period.I started experimenting with my gender presentation and on Instagram and Tumblr, I changed my pronouns to heshe. I thought I was gender-fluid because the concept of transitioning was too scary. I was only 13 or 14 at this point. Some days I wanted to be girly, other days I wanted to dress like a man.In my final year at school, I remember saying to my boyfriend that I needed to pick a side. Some days I would say my pronouns are “hehim” and others I would say, my pronouns are “sheher”. Before going to college I swallowed my dysphoria, and for the next two years of my life I decided I was going to be as girly as possible and blend in and be totally normal.But when I was 18 and did my last exam, I suddenly decided I needed to go ahead with this transition. The big narrative being pushed is that transition will be the answer to all your problems. I confided in my boyfriend and he was very supportive because, back then, he assumed that doctors knew what they were doing.The NHS waiting time for hormones is about five or six years, so I saved up enough money from my gap year job to pay for private gender therapy. In March 2018, I contacted Gender GP, an online health and wellbeing clinic for transgender people and was given a 30-minute phone consultation costing £300 I never had a face-to-face consultation. In June, I was prescribed hormones. There was no exploration of my sexual trauma, and no mention of my upbringing and how that could have affected things.The consultation included a question about fertility risks and whether I wanted children. Because of what I’d read on social media, I knew I needed to say ‘no’ in order to be prescribed hormones. They didn’t tell me all the potential side effects, such as heart problems and loss of bone density, or the extent to which it could impact fertility.(A spokesman for the online gender clinic, GenderGP, says: “We operate an informed model of care – that means we start from a position of belief if you say you are trans. Our job is not to try and validate your gender, or prove whether you are trans. Our job is to support you to make the best decisions.”)For the first year or so, I was over the moon. I changed my name to Ryan. It took about three months to see changes, which included developing more muscle mass and broader shoulders. My periods stopped, which I was very happy about. Socially, I enjoyed going out and being read as male, and was pleased to no longer attract unwelcome sexual attention from men. My relationship with my boyfriend was pretty much the same, though when we went out we did sometimes attract invasive questions about how we had sex.I was a lot more emotionally stable – no longer having the up-and-down emotions that girls tend to have as a result of a hormonal cycle. My friends were all very accepting. Although my dad found the name change difficult, he said that as I was an adult, I could do what I wanted. I had been binding my breasts and had saved up £7,000 to pay for a double mastectomy, but in the end decided it would be better to spend it on travelling or buying a house. I’m glad I didn’t go ahead.Then during my first term at the University of Lancaster, where I was studying psychology, I went through a bad mental health episode. After attempting suicide, I was referred to a social worker. When I explained to him that I’d always felt like an outcast and struggled if things weren’t routine, he suggested I might have autism.After being referred to specialists for an assessment, my autism diagnosis was confirmed. It was like having pieces of a jigsaw come together, enabling me to see the full picture.About six months later, I decided to come off testosterone. The online clinic advised me not to come off it altogether, because of my gender dysphoria, and recommended instead that I halve my dose. Initially, I did this, but when my periods came back, I decided to stop it altogether. I didn’t speak to any other medical professionals and didn’t have any more contact with the clinic, except to cancel my £30 monthly subscription fee.Although I had felt happy passing as male, I was never 100 per cent comfortable. I was constantly worried about whether I looked too female. A part of me felt like I was lying to myself and others.Fertility was another big factor. When I turned 20, I realised I really wanted a family – and I had chosen to self-sterilise for no good reason.I felt embarrassed about detransitioning, but friends and colleagues were very supportive, although my dad was concerned and had a lot of questions. Initially, I missed the emotional stability I’d had on testosterone. I also hated getting my periods back, because ever since detransitioning, my menstrual cycle has been an absolute mess, and I am now being investigated for polycystic ovary syndrome. Apart from this, given my periods have returned, I should be able to conceive.Physically, one of the most difficult things has been the amount of body hair I’ve been left with – I still need to shave a lot. My voice is deeper than it used to be.But it’s great to be able to dress up again. And my boyfriend has been fine with me detransitioning – the good thing about dating a bi dude is they don’t care either way.The main advice I’d give to others with gender dysphoria is to wait until you’re 21 before going on hormones. Let your body be an adult woman’s body before you decide to change it.  And listen to detransitioner stories, such as those of Sinead Watson and Keira Bell. If you believe you might have some sort of neuroergence or a history of abuse, think about how those things might have affected you.I’m now 22 and feel a lot better. I dropped out of my original university course and from September I plan to study criminology at a different university. What’s been nice is that I now accept my body. I do experience pangs of dysphoria, but they’re nowhere near as frequent as they used to be. My long-term plan is to become a probation officer – and I look forward to a future that includes children.If you need support with a family member who’s struggling with gender dysphoria, you can contact Genspect at info@Genspect.org.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow\u0026#39s lies no match for \u0026#39undeniable evidence\u0026#39, says BidenNato offers weapons upgrade for Donbas showdownNato members to ramp up supply of ‘heavy weapons’ to KyivAt least two dead and eight injured in Tel Aviv tourist hotspot shootingRishi Sunak says he is the victim of a \u0026#39smear\u0026#39 campaignMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxfordshire went blue county green agenda","story":"It was quite a spread. For the first full meeting of Oxfordshire County Council since the decision was taken to supply only “plant-based” food for its gathering representatives, on Tuesday the stops had been pulled out. Ian Middleton, one of the Green Party councillors who had pushed through the policy on the basis that meat farming damaged the environment, was so pleased with the fare on offer at the council meeting, he took a picture and tweeted it.“Absolute triumph,” he wrote of a buffet replete with kiwi fruit, mangoes and grapes. “Very enthusiastically received.”Some observers, however, were less than enthused by the grub. Oxfordshire Food and Farming, a lobbying group for local producers, which had organised a protest outside the council chambers when the policy was being first debated back in February, was particularly aggrieved. Here were the councillors, insisting that meat production was harmful to the planet, enjoying food that quite clearly had to have been flown in from afar.“Apparently, Oxfordshire sausages are bad for the planet, but mangoes from South Africa and grapes brought in by jets from the Canaries are fine,” said a representative of Oxfordshire Food and Farming.Johnnie Alden, who runs Hollands Farm Beef in Great Milton, added: “The message the decision by the council gives out is that meat-eating is always bad for the environment and that it’s not possible to combine all types of food into a healthy sustainable diet. They’re out of touch with their constituents, they should use their voice to support the rural economy, not to attack it.”Liz Leffman, head of the local Liberal Democrats and the council leader, however, was having none of it. She saw no hypocrisy in the fare on offer. “Of course we don’t grow fruit in this country at this time of year,” she said. “So if you’re going to eat fruit, it is going to have to come from somewhere else.”Never mind the air miles, then, enjoy the kiwi fruit.But it was what happened after lunch that was even more revealing about Oxfordshire County Council’s processes. Refreshed by their anti-meat buffet, the councillors went on to debate what they considered the pressing issues of the day. Not so much how to fill in the potholes in the county’s roads, or what to do with the rising tide of effluent fouling the local rivers, but inclusive toilets. One of the decisions they made was to look into how they might roll out lavatories without gender restriction in all 600 council buildings, including – eventually – the county schools. This, Ms Leffman explained, was part of a drive for “transgender and binary inclusion across Oxfordshire”.Eddie Reeves, the leader of the Conservative opposition on the council, however, pointed out the move will cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, placing unnecessary strain on already squeezed budgets. “It is a huge capital spend that is being advocated at a time when the council already has too many buildings,” he says.Never mind struggling to supply books, teachers or computer capacity, here is the council considering spending scant resources on ensuring no one feels compromised by a sign on the lavatories that says “Gents”.Not that the council’s policy agenda stops there. This, after all, is the authority which, under its presiding GreenLib Dem alliance, has pledged to be the first in the country to ban all outdoor smoking by 2025. It is also pressing ahead with a zero-emission charging zone in the middle of Oxford, in which all visitors, suppliers to local business and local residents will be charged up to £10 a day should they use diesel or petrol-powered vehicles. It is a move which has provoked considerable concern among traders in the centre of the city, who fear their livelihood will be threatened.“I don’t like it when the council tries to impose their views that have nothing to do with reality,” Lorenzo De Gregori, a trader and a parish councillor in Blackbird Leys, told the local Oxford Mail. “It’s not egalitarian. It will have the biggest impact on those who cannot afford the charge. They just want to remove cars.”This is a council, its critics suggest, that spends local funds engaging in a progressive cultural warfare rather than addressing the needs of its constituents, a council engaging in student politics when what everyone really wants from its representatives is to ensure the bins are collected on time.But how did it come to this? How did an area more characterised by waxed jackets and mud-encrusted wellies, by Easter point-to-point meetings and farmers’ markets, what is the most rural county in England and surely natural territory for the Conservatives, find itself being run by a council of putative Citizen Smiths?The answer is clear when you take a drive from the glorious open expanse of the Cotswolds into Oxford along the A40. On the fringes of the city, a vast area of what was once green fields is being rapidly modernised under concrete and steel. Giant bulldozers have ripped up the hedges and torn down the trees. Workmen in hi-viz jackets hack and hoik at the open space. This is Oxford North, a 64-acre greenfield site that will soon accommodate offices, laboratories and new homes, a venture described by the local paper as “Oxford’s Silicon Valley”.“This is probably the most depressing thing I’ve ever seen,” says Dr Carol Peaker, who lives in nearby Wolvercote as she observes the building work. “You know, even as you watch this happening, that once this has gone it’s not coming back.”And it is by no means an isolated example. Everywhere you look in the county, construction is underway, the green belt is being erased. For the past few years, under a majority Conservative administration, more and more development was nodded through, as the county strained to meet central government targets of 100,000 new homes by the end of the decade. And everywhere, locals despaired as their once glorious rural environment withered in front of their eyes. Furious, many turned to the progressive Green and Liberal Democrat Alliance which pledged to resist the onslaught. They took control of the council last May.Ian Middleton, for instance, was voted in by residents of south Kidlington. This quiet market town has long been proud of the fact that it is separated from Oxford itself by a wedge of green land. Not for much longer. A huge estate of new houses is set to consume both an area of farmland and a swathe currently occupied by the North Oxford Golf Club. What makes the prospect even more unattractive for members soon to be deprived of the room to swing and putt is that the 18th green is not to be subsumed under the kind of affordable homes the city desperately needs to house its teachers, nurses and bus drivers. It will disappear under another swathe of executive culs-de-sac to accommodate the latest wave of incomers cashing in on London’s ever skyrocketing house prices.Middleton and other Greens were elected on a pledge to stand up to what many see as irreversible vandalism. And, indeed, in some parts of the county such resistance has worked. west of Oxford, In the village of Fyfield, a plan to build 650 homes was thrown out in February by Liberal Democrat councillors who had been newly elected specifically on a pledge to put a halt to building.In Oxfordshire, it seems that if a brake is to be applied to the relentless march of concrete, plant-based buffets and the installation of gender inclusive lavatories is a price the locals are currently obliged to pay.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow\u0026#39s lies no match for \u0026#39undeniable evidence\u0026#39, says BidenNato offers weapons upgrade for Donbas showdownNato members to ramp up supply of ‘heavy weapons’ to KyivAt least two dead and eight injured in Tel Aviv tourist hotspot shootingRishi Sunak says he is the victim of a \u0026#39smear\u0026#39 campaignMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"truth rome may brutal young handle","story":"It will be a delicate task. Although it might be horrifying to modern minds, perhaps the CLC could begin by reflecting that, in Roman society, slaves effectively had the status of a tool. They were bought for a purpose – everything from, worst of all, working down the mines, to doctors, architects, jewellers or professors, who were purchased at great expense and expected to use their skills to the household’s advantage.And then there were the masters. There were those who understood about human relationships and how to get the best out of people. Uniquely in the ancient world, Roman slaves who did good service to their masters stood the chance of being freed. In that case they and their children would become citizens (and at once buy slaves themselves). There are thousands of monuments and inscriptions set up by such “freedmen”, announcing their pride in their achievements.Equally there were very bad masters. Life for their slaves would have been intolerable. And since one can assume that this is the picture CLC wishes to paint, for fear that innocent children will otherwise come away with the impression the slavery was wonderful, this raises a problem. How are they going to turn Caecilius, the male “lead” of the course, currently a good master, into a bad master?The point here is that we live in a world of trigger warnings, and the trigger warnings that the ancient world sets off will probably burst our sensitive pupils’ ear drums. For starters, the ancients had no concept of human rights. They had no belief even in the right to life.In such a situation, the treatment which bad masters meted out to their slaves is not fit for human consumption by anyone of any age, let alone under 16. Male and female slaves could be raped at will by the master and his sons, hired out as prostitutes, sold off to fight to the death as gladiators, or for almost any other purpose that human wickedness could devise.The CLC is right to want its pupils to have as accurate a picture of the Roman world as possible. But good luck to them on achieving that end on a subject as complex and, if we are to believe what we are told about the young, as traumatising as slavery.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow\u0026#39s lies no match for \u0026#39undeniable evidence\u0026#39, says BidenNato offers weapons upgrade for Donbas showdownNato members to ramp up supply of ‘heavy weapons’ to KyivAt least two dead and eight injured in Tel Aviv tourist hotspot shootingRishi Sunak says he is the victim of a \u0026#39smear\u0026#39 campaignMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eric pickles moans grenfell inquiry","story":"Eric Pickles moans to Grenfell Inquiry he has a busy day then gets death toll wrongTory Lord Pickles complained he had an extremely busy day meeting people and I would urge you to use your time wisely at the probe into the fire that killed  people, years after his war on red tape.

Lord Pickles, who led a crackdown on “red tape” while in charge of the housing department from  to , admitted ministers should have acted more on warnings before the blaze during two days of questioning. But on his second day he snapped to lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC: By all means sir, feel free to ask me as many questions as you like. “But could I respectfully remind you that you did promise that we would be away this morning and I have changed my schedules to fit this in. I do have an extremely busy day meeting people. But this is more important than anything - but I would urge you to use your time wisely.  Lord Pickles later apologised for “any way I seemed discourteous”, adding: “As soon as I left the room I took the decision to cancel everything. “This is more important than anything I’m doing and I apologise… I fully understand that you’re doing a proper job.” But at the end of his evidence, he tripped up separately - appearing to mistake the death toll for that of Hillsborough, which until recently was . The toll from the  football ground disaster rose to  last year after a coroner’s ruling on the death of fan Andrew Devine. Lord Pickles referred to coroneraposs recommendations after the  Lakanal House fire in south London, which killed six people and injured  more. The first report from the Grenfell Inquiry found lessons from Lakanal fire had not been learned by the time of the Grenfell disaster eight years later.  He said: “It comes down to Michelleand to the nameless  people who were killed in the Grenfell fire. Itaposs them who we should think about when weaposre arguing the toss. Ultimately, as Iaposve said earlier, the dead deserve the dignity of being remembered by name and the dead deserve the dignity of a solution.”Lord Pickles was also chairman of the Conservative Party from  to .He made the mistake at the end of his evidence while answeringthere was anything he would have done dferently. After Lakanal, he said, “maybe I should have put in the letter the simple sentence aposand I accept the coroneraposs recommendationsapos - would that have changed things ”. But he added: “I donapost think it would have made any dference whatsoever.  There was a kind of mindset that existed in parts of the department that just simply ignored what was happening, made a view about what we were and came to it. Askedthe department should have “done more” to take on the lessons from Lakanal he replied: “Oh, definitely”. He added it was a personal failing on his part, “on the basis that I’m responsible for everything. The fact that I didn’t know about it, that no one briefed me… is no reasonable excuse, because ultimately it is always my fault.” But he also slammed firms that used flammable cladding, saying: “The conditions existed that there were people putting things in, into  and the like, that were combustible. “The idea to me is: how would anybody ever want to do that  How would they ever think it was a good idea ” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Eric PicklesConservative PartyPublic inquiryRed tapePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Labour leader Keir Starmer condemned her “breathtaking hypocrisy” for claiming non-dom status while living in Downing Street with a Chancellor husband who has hiked taxes for millions of ordinary people. While the Tories force people to choose between eating or heating, the millionaire Chancellor with four luxury homes parades his wealth on social media, posing in £ slider shoes before the last Budget and with a £ “smart mug” the year before. His brutal .% hike in National Insurance came into force this week. Our investigation found the Murty family’s vast Infosys business made tens of millions of pounds from British taxpayer-funded contracts, some since Mr Sunak became Chancellor in . Since , Infosys has earned £million working for the Care Quality Commission, the regulator of UK care homes. In , it won a £m contract with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and this year secured a £m IT contract from the Tory-run East Sussex County Council. Infosys is among companies which shared £m in public sector contracts between  and . It was one of  suppliers in a £m deal with Transport for London in , at a time when Prime Minister Boris Johnson was Mayor of London.And it was one of nine partners in a £m contract with Tory-run Westminster City Council last year. Angela Rayner, Labour’s Deputy Leader, told the Mirror: “The British public deserve answers. The Government is already awash with Tory cronyism. Now it seems the Chancellor’s close family are personally benefiting from lucrative public contracts. Rishi Sunak must come clean about these business interests and any potential conflicts.”And Ed Miliband said the Chancellor should issue an “explanation” about his we’s tax status. Speaking to Sky News, the Shadow Secretary of State for Climate Change said: “He is the UK Chancellor asking people to pay more in taxes. “Is it right that his immediate family is sheltering from UK taxes  I think Rishi Sunak and his family should reflect on that. Non-dom status is legal but I think we should be clear that non-dom status is used to... pay less tax than you otherwise would.”  Christine Jardine, Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman, said: “Infosys benefiting from millions in UK Government contracts raises serious questions. It is wrong that profits making their way from these contracts into the Chancellor’s household don’t face their fair share of UK tax.” Ms Murty, who wed Mr Sunak in , is one of Britain’s richest women, her stake of almost % in Infosys worth a reported £m. Earnings from its UK public sector projects contributed to global Infosys revenues of £.bn last year, which earned profits of £.bn. It is estimated Ms Murty earns more than £m in idends from her stake, but she is not domiciled in the UK for tax purposes. On Wednesday, her spokeswoman said because she is an Indian citizen and India does not allow dual citizenship, then “according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”.  The spokeswoman admitted yesterday that Ms Murty pays £, a year for her non-dom status. And Professor of Accounting Richard Murphy said: “She is only non-domiciled because she asked to be so.” There is no suggestion of wrongdoing. But, as a non-dom, Ms Murty does not need to pay tax on idends from overseas firms such as Infosys. It was founded by her dad Narayana Murty, has its HQ in India and is listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. If taxed on £m of Infosys idends in the UK, Ms Murty would pay more than £m, while in India she would pay as little as %, or £.m. Tax Justice UK executive director, Robert Palmer, said: “Ordinary people who face an increase to their national insurance contributions this week will be shocked to learn the Chancellor’s own we is a non-dom. This status could potentially save her substantial amounts of tax. The Government should end tax loopholes such as non-dom status and make sure those who have wealth pay their share.” Labour leader Mr Starmer said: “The Chancellor has imposed tax rise after tax rise on working people and he’s said time and again there’s no alternative, we’ve got no option. If it now transpires that his we has used schemes to reduce her own tax then that’s breathtaking hypocrisy and is more evidence of just how out of touch this Chancellor is.”The Prime Minister dodged questions about Ms Murty’s tax affairs. He said: “I think it is very important in politics,you possibly can, to try and keep people’s families out of it.” Last week, Mr Sunak objected to questions over Infosys’s business in Russia, while telling UK firms to “think very carefully” about making investments potentially beneficial to Putin regime.He said he found criticism of his we “very upsetting”. It has since emerged that Infosys is closing its Russian office.  Mr Sunak last month delivered a Spring Statement which failed to tackle the cost of living crisis. He and his family live in a flat above No, but they also own a £m mews property in Kensington, a flat in Old Brompton Road, a £m, -acre country pile in his Yorkshire constituency, and a lavish apartment in Santa Monica, Calornia. After the Chancellor was snapped filling up a car – not his, but a vehicle belonging to a supermarket worker – after the Spring Statement, Mr Sunak said he drove an old VW golf. He failed to mention he had use of at least three others, a Range Rover, a top-of-the-range Lexus, and a BMW. The Mirror has contacted the Treasury, Infosys and Ms Murty for comment.

But years of standstill wages and cuts to social security have left millions of families exposed to soaring energy and food prices.Make no mistake, this country is facing a living standards emergency. But so far the response from government has been hopelessly out of touch. Rather than stepping in to help people get through the worst cost-of-living crisis in generations, ministers have left households to fend for themselves. They mustn’t be allowed to get away this. Without extra support, families across Britain will be pushed to the brink.That’s why the TUC is demanding the Chancellor comes back to Parliament with an Emergency Budget. The TUC is calling for Rishi Sunak to do three things. Firstly, he must give cash help directly to hard-pressed families to pay their energy bills. This would be better than the measly £ a week households will receive in energy loans and council tax rebates. And he should impose a windfall tax on greedy oil and gas companies to pay for it. It is insulting to hear BP executives boast about having “more cash than we know what to do with” when households up and down the country are struggling to make ends meet.Secondly, he must boost Universal Credit and pensions. Low-paid workers on UC will see it rise by just £ this year.But with average energy bills shooting up by £ this spring, and by hundreds more in the autumn, how can ministers expect people to survive on this  UC needs increasing to cover rising expenses, and so too do pensions. The Government’s ­manesto-breaking decision to stop pensions from rising in line with the cost of living is going to cause real financial hardship. It means people on the full new state pension are losing £ a year and those on the full basic state pension £ a year. Thirdly, ministers must get wages rising. That means an emergency boost to the minimum wage to at least £ an hour, now. And it means working with unions and employers to get pay rising across the economy. Here is a staggering fact: pay packets are still worth less – in real terms – than they were in .  This has left millions of people vulnerable to sudden price rises, and that’s what is happening now. The only way to fix this long term is to get back to proper pay rises every year. And that means working with unions to get wages rising in every job. The clock is ticking. The longer the Government delays taking action the more damage will be done to people’s livelihoods.Over to you Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonBPTescoTrades Union CongressPensionsTaxCouncil taxEnergy billsLiving standardsMinimum wagePrice risesState pensionThe economyPoliticsDaily MirrorCost of Living: Were Here to Help\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The situation is so bad that police chiefs are warning of a crime spree as desperate parents steal to feed their children. Boris Johnson accepted today that the poorest households were having to choose between heating and eating.

Its understood it was never formally tabledRishi Sunak announced no new help for energy bills in his Spring Statement Image: rishisunakmp  InstagramByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Apr Rishi Sunak has been accused of blocking plans to more than double the £ energy bills “rebate”. All households will get a £ discount off their bills in October which then has to be repaid over five years. A leaked document now shows an official suggested “we could boost the recently announced rebate scheme”. That could include “increase the amount of the rebate e.g. from £ to £ or more - either for all or just for fuel poor households”, said the paper obtained by the i newspaper. It’s understood the document was from a Business Department official who was asked for options on what more the government could do, and was never formally tabled.  But the idea has not so far been announced by the Tory Chancellor, despite announcing tax cuts in his Spring Statement. The leaked document also suggested the government could delay the point at which the rebate has to be repaid. It could also extend the repayment period, or exclude the poorest from having to repay the cash, the document said. Critics say the £ does not touch the sides of this month’s £-a-year hike in energy bills - let alone another rise expected on October . Furious billpayers have also complained it is a loan that they never signed up to. It is understood the idea of raising the rebate beyond £ is not dead forever, as the official had been asked for their ideas for the run-up to another energy bills spike on October . That is still nearly six months away, and the Treasury has not ruled out further help.But Boris Johnson warned yesterday: “Weaposve got to be frank with people, thereaposs a limit to the amount of taxpayersapos money we can simply push towards trying to deal with global energy price spikes.”A Government spokesperson said: “We understand that people are struggling with the rising cost of living – we can’t shield everyone from the global challenges we face but we’re putting billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working families across the UK.“We are taking action worth over £ billion next financial year to help people with the cost of their energy bills and to ensure people keep more of their money, including increasing the National Insurance thresholds saving a typical employee over £ a year, boosting incomes by £, for an average full-time worker by increasing the National Living Wage and helping low-income families keep more of what they earn by reducing the Universal Credit taper rate.“We have set out a bold energy strategy that will reduce our dependence on power sources exposed to volatile international prices, meaning we can enjoy greater self-sufficiency with cheaper bills.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON The TreasuryNational Insurance Company Ltd.Spring StatementBoris JohnsonEnergy billsPoliticsBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Conservative minister wrote to members of the House of Lords in a bid to defend Boris Johnsonaposs Elections Bill. Peers successfully moved to water down the controversial bill in the Lords this week, expanding the number of forms of acceptable ID. But a move to kill off the voter ID proposals entirely did not succeed. Ministers have been warned strict ID rules at polling stations will lead to lower turnout in elections and potentially millions of people losing the right to vote. But in a letter to fellow peers, Lord True defended the move because in Northern Ireland, where photo ID was introduced in , turnout was higher than in other parts of the UK.  He wrote: ...in the first general election after photo identication was introduced , turnout in Northern Ireland was higher than in each of England, Scotland and Wales.But Lord True did not mention that turnout in Northern Ireland dropped signicantly following the introduction of voter ID. And a Cabinet Office official admitted as much in a letter to campaigners in April , and noted the dip in turnout lasted until ,  years later. Writing to Unlock Democracyaposs Tom Brake, the official wrote: Across the three main elections in Northern Ireland , turnout appeared to be lower after the introduction of photographic identication as part of the Electoral Fraud Act in .  Lord Trueaposs claim that the introduction of photo voter ID wonapost reduce turnout will fool nobody, Mr Brake told the Mirror. The Government is already on record confirming that, not only did it reduce turnout in NI, but the effect lasted for  years. Photo voter ID, with an exorbitant price tag of up to £ million over ten years, should be scrapped. It serves no real purpose and will make it harder to vote. Peers voted on Monday to water down the governmentaposs plans. They backed an amendment from Tory ex-minister Lord Willetts to expand the list of accepted identication to include non-photo documents - such as birth certicates, bank statements, council tax demands and library cards. But the amendment could be stripped out when the bill s to the House of Commons for its final stage. Pilots of the voter ID crackdown, which will cost £m over a decade, showed  voters were denied a vote in just  areas. Yet there were just  claims of in-person voter fraud from  to  - of which three led to a conviction. A spokesperson for the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Everyone eligible to vote will have the opportunity to do so - % of electors already have an accepted form of identication, and any that don’t can apply for a free Voter Card from their council. “We cannot be complacent when it comes to ensuring our democracy remains secure and our Elections Bill will protect the integrity of our elections and stamp out the potential for voter fraud.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyHouse of CommonsHouse of LordsBoris JohnsonCouncil taxPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Parliamentary Dentistry and Oral Health group he chairs aims to raise the profile of dentistry Image: Daily Mirror Phil HarrisByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr |commentsA Conservative MP who chairs Parliament’s group on dentistry saw his own dental practice fail its safety inspection. Sir Paul Beresford, chair of the APPG for Dentistry and Oral Health, runs his own private dental practice, Beresford Dental Practice Ltd, in Wandsworth, South West London. He is listed on the Care Quality Commissionwebsite as the registered manager responsible for the “treatment of disease, disorder or injury,” “surgical procedures,” and “diagnostic and screening procedures.” But after the CQC inspected his practice last November, officials ruled his practice was not providing safe care. The report published in January  said: “We found this practice was not providing safe care in accordance with the relevant regulations.”  “We found this practice was not providing well-led care in accordance with the relevant regulations,” it added. CQC officials went on to specically criticise Sir Paulaposs leadership of the practice: “The provider did not demonstrate that there were effective systems for leadership and management including oversight, assessment and mitigation of risks and implementation of systems to monitor and improve the service.” Feryal Clark, Shadow Minister for Primary Care and Patient Safety, said: “With the cost-of-living crisis really starting to bite and working people braced for tax rises, this will cause yet another toothache for the Tories. “After his own dental practice failed a safety inspection, Beresford’s role as Chair of the parliamentary group on dentistry is hard to swallow.” After the dancing report, the CQC urged the practice to take several steps to meet regulatory requirements as part of “enforcement action”. Mr Beresford has claimed the CQC have since given his practice a clean bill of health. He told the Mirror his practice only failed technically and insisted last Wednesday the CQC revisited his practice and deemed it safe.  They are writing the report up now. It will take some time, he said. The updated report Sir Paul refers to, is yet to be published and has not been acknowledged by the CQC. Other problems highlighted by the CQC included:There were no assurances that the X-ray equipment was tested and checked in accordance with current national regulations and guidance. Provider had not registered with the Health and Safety Executiveand had not appointed a Radiation Protection Advisoror a Radiation Protection Supervisor. There was no legionella risk assessment in place. There was no general practice risk assessment.Sir Paul often cites his expertise when praising the Governmentaposs work towards dentistry issues.In a debate last year, he chastised Labour MP Mohamed Yasin for raising issues with emergency dentistry in the UK, saying: “His speech was a barrage of negativity, and it is not all negativity in this field,” adding “I am a practising dentist.”Sir Paul hit the headlines in  when it was revealed he had designated his London property, which includes his surgery, as his second home on his parliamentary allowances, claiming a proportion of the running costs of the building on expenses.

The idea is to keep energy bills under control as we end Russian oil, coal andgas imports due to the “abhorrent and illegal invasion of Ukraine ”. But under pressure from warring Tories, Mr Johnson dropped key pledges on hilltop wind farms - and is set to plough more resources into North Sea oil.He also announced no help for families’ soaring energy bills now - and nothing new for insulating homes.  The ,-word policy was still being worked out at the last minute and was published as a simple web page, with no time for fancy graphs or even a proper PDF document.But the Tony Blair Institute said “expensive, slow and risky options [have been] backed over quick, cheap and popular ones”.So what is actually in the energy strategy and what are the gaping holes he missed  Here’s what you need to know. things the government has announced ‘Up to’  nuclear reactors in  yearsThe document vows to reverse “decades” of short-sightedness, including under Tory governments, and “invest massively in nuclear power”. It aims to take one “final investment decision” on nuclear - possibly a new site at Sizewell - by  and another in the next Parliament, by . Between them these could lead to eight reactors by , it’s claimed, because there can be more than one reactor at each power station. These could be a mixture of large ‘gigawatt reactors’ and Small Modular Reactors - raising nuclear from % of our power now to % in . But there are big questions about funding and how realistic ‘one reactor a year’ actually is - more below. It’s thought the “up to” eight new reactors would go on some of the eight sites already approved to host nuclear reactors. These are Hinkley, Sizewell, Heysham, Hartlepool, Bradwell, Wylfa, Oldbury and Moorside - with Wylfa lined up for an imminent project. After that, the government will “develop a strategy” that could identy new sites that’ve never hosted a nuclear plant before. But this seems a long way off. New investment in North Sea oil - despite our green goalsThe document pledges a new round of licences to launch this Autumn for oil and gas projects in the North Sea. It claims there’s “no contradiction” between this and Britain’s pledge to reach Net Zero carbon emissions - which will be a “smooth transition, not immediate extinction”. But Rebecca Newsom of Greenpeace UK said Tories are dishing out rewards to vested interests in the nuclear and the oil and gas industries. The document insists Britain will have “reduced our gas consumption by over % by ”. And “by , we will have decarbonised our electricity system, subject to security of supply”. That’s a get-out clause - it’s understood gas could still be used in some circumstances beyond . Meanwhile the strategy leaves the door open to fracking - currently banned thanks to the  Tory manesto - after Tory MPs urged a rethink. But that door is only just open. It says while the government “remains open-minded”, the pause on fracking “continues to remain in place unless new evidence emerge”. Lots of new offshore wind power The strategy repeats Boris Johnson ’s dubious pledge to become “the Saudi Arabia of wind power” with it generating more than half our renewable energy by .That would be “up to” GW by , including “up to” GW from massive floating wind turbines. The government will cut the consent time down from four yers to one strengthen policy statements and review habitat assessments from late  to ‘reduce reams of paperwork’ on protecting wildle. But again there are questions about cash. Today’s plan highlights a £m pot to kickstart work on floating wind turbines which Boris Johnson announced in the autumn. The UK’s first floating wind farm alone, which has five turbines, cost more than that entire funding pot. Energy firm Equinor spent billion Norwegian Kroner - equivalent to around £m - on the Hywind Scotland plant  miles off the coast of Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, in . Its ft high floating turbines each weighs , tonnes and has a rotor diameter of ft - equivalent to three Nelson’s Columns stacked end to end. A five-fold rise in solar power, with relaxed planning rulesThere is currently GW of solar capacity in the UK but the cost of building it has dropped % in a decade, so the government wants a five-fold rise to GW by . For ground solar farms, ministers will consult on tearing up planning rules to tip more “in favour of development” on non-protected land. Communities would still get a say. For rooftop solar , the government has vowed to “radically simply” the planning process, launching a consultation on using “permitted development” rights. This meansyou want to put a solar  on your roof, you could do it without having to submit a full-blown planning application. The government is also “looking at” getting banks to offer low-cost finance on solar  or energy efficiency for homes. But critics say it’s not enough - more below.Hydrogen, tidal and geothermal powerThe plan promises investment in hydrogen, tidal and geothermal power - but despite chatter about this for decades it’s pretty thin on details. It simply says we will “aggressively explore renewable opportunities afforded by our geography and geology, including tidal and geothermal”. Hydrogen - which could eventually replace gas in central heating for households who don’t get a heat pump - is a bit more concrete. The plan vows to double the target for hydrogen production capacity by , to GW. But that would be “subject to affordability and value for money”. There would also be a hydrogen certication scheme by , “to demonstrate high-grade British hydrogen for export and ensure any imported hydrogen meets the same high standards”. The Tony Blair Institute claims the hydrogen strategy is “bizarre” because it would create “signicant” new demand for natural gas in the production process. … and the  gaping holes in the plan Bottling Boris Johnson scrapped onshore wind targetsAn early version of the document pledged GW of capacity from onshore wind by  and GW by  - up from GW now. But despite hilltop wind turbines being much cheaper than ones in the sea, the final document drops this target - due to a Tory tussle over the “eyesore” machines. The pledge is seriously watered down, with a promise of “no wholesale changes” to the planning system. The government will “consult” this year on “local partnerships” where “supportive” villages that agree to wind farms could get cheaper bills in . But in a victory for rural Tories it adds: “The government recognises the range of views on onshore wind. Our plans will prioritise putting local communities in control.” There’s no help for energy bills now Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was revealing when he said: “I think the impact could be very soon. And by soon, I mean, three or four years.” The plan mentions the £ repayable rebate to energy bills, but offers nothing new, just as reports emerge that Rishi Sunak blocked a suggestion to raise it to £.Government officials insist they were never pretending this would give short-term help for bills, and it will eventually bring down costs in the long term. But the Lib Dems said: “Itaposs a disgrace that the Chancellor is refusing to offer extra help to hard pressed families facing soaring energy bills.” Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden added: The Tories have no plan to immediately address their cost of living crisis.He could back Labour ’s fair and funded plan for a one-off tax on the booming profits of oil and gas giants - which would reduce household bills by up to £.” There’s nothing new for insulating your homeCampaigners hit out furiously at the fact that there’s no new hard fund or target in the plan today for getting old, draughty homes insulated. Simon McWhirter of the UK Green Building Council added: Today was a chance to insulate the nation’s homes, protect us against future price hikes and tackle the painful effects of rising energy costs to households. The Government has woefully missed its opportunity.”The funding for those nuclear power stations is very murkyAs above, a big new plank of the plan is investing massively in nuclear power stations - with three funding decisions in the next two parliaments. But what’s missing is any set amount of cash promised now. And that will be hard to come by, especially as a dferent PM - Labour or Tory - could be in charge by then. The document is also full of catches and get-out clauses about the hope of building eight new nuclear reactors by . It says: “Final contracts and construction would commence when any outstanding conditions are satisfied and projects are sufficiently mature. “Any projects would be subject to a value for money assessment, all relevant approvals and future spending reviews.” Imports of Russian gas CAN continue The whole reason behind the plan is Russia ’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, and our need to cut off the “war machine” by no longer buying Russian energy.But while coal and oil imports to the UK will end by December , we’ll only wean off Russian gas “as soon as possible thereafter”. Despite % of our gas coming from Russia, sources admit the industry - already handling rocketing prices - cannot afford the sudden end of Russian gas. That’s why there is no hard target on ending our dependence on Russian gas, despite Putin’s regime being accused of war crimes.

Gabby, who is a Spurs fan, played for Palace until she was , when she moved to Carshalton. After Carshalton folded, she went to Sutton United FC where she has been playing on the First Team ever since. “The club has a really good set up for women’s football,” Gabby explained, adding she trains twice a week on top of her day job. “They really want to encourage young girls when they arrive and there’s no dference between male and female players.” She added she likes the fact her coaches aren’t “soft” on her because she’s a woman - which she thinks can be an issue in the women’s game.But while the centre-back is proud of her sporting achievements, she says they can be marred by vile trolls who stalk her Instagram, TikTok and Twitter pages. She shared some of the sexist TikTok comments she receives on her account @_gabbyhowell. Under one video, someone commented: “Gabby how come you’re out of the kitchen ” Another said: “Always s***! It’s a woman trying to play a man’s sport.” One even said: “That’s the trouble with women’s football, I think players are picked on looks rather than talent.” Gabby also has to put up with men saying women “can’t compete” with men. As well as the sexist comments, she also receives derogatory messages on Instagram from men who don’t take her seriously. “Men will say they’re horny underneath my photos of me playing football - andI tag my club in the post it’s embarrassing,” she said.  Gabby thinks one of the reasons she’s targeted is because she plays football but also likes to dress up, wear make up and go out at the weekend. “You can be both - you can play football and like wearing high heels,” she said. Despite having to put up with sexist trolling, Gabby is determined to use her  to inspire young girls to get into football. She also wants young women playing football to stay in the game and not let the sexism get to them. “I like to keep [the hateful comments] on my profiles and I don’t delete them,” she explained, adding she wants people to see having a lot of followers on Instagram isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. “Young girls think they want to be an influencer but they don’t see the downsides. I like to make people aware.” Although she admits there was one occasion when trolls “broke her,” she’s never let it happen since. “Not everyone’s going to like you.

The -year-old, who works in communications and is a mental health campaigner, said the policy left her feeling “fraught with anxiety” when she went out for dinner with her boyfriend a few nights ago. She told The Mirror: “I already had an idea of what I wanted to eat because I’ve been [to that restaurant] before. The last time was about three months ago, but they didn’t have the calories on the menu then.” Rachel, who says she’s trying to eat new things when she visits restaurants as part of her ongoing recovery, said she and her sister opted for something she wouldn’t normally order. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here But when she ed to the restaurant with her boyfriend and saw the calories on the menu, she says she immediately began evaluating them. “That’s what jumps out to an eating disorder brain,” Rachel explained. “You start looking for the ‘safest’ option.” In the end, Rachel picked out a meal she liked the sound of - but she only ate half of it, conscious about the calorie content with every bite. “I skipped having a juice because the soft drinks had calories on them too. A juice has more calories than a Diet Coke,” she said. Rachel’s battle with an eating disorder dates back to when she was  and began extreme calorie counting. “I first kind of noticed there was an issue shortly after the mandatory calorie labelling and traffic light system came into effect in supermarkets,” she said. Rachel added she doesn’t think the system was the sole reason for the manestation of her eating disorder.  She explained: “I’d also recently been through a bereavement and I have a family history of eating disorders.” As time went on, Rachel became more and more obsessed with calorie counting, which developed into anorexia. Just a young teenager at the time, her body quickly became malnourished. “I did become very unwell and I ended up in AE. There were concerns over the blood flow to my heart and brain.“I had low blood pressure which can have an affect on the brain, as not enough blood is getting to it.”As Rachel’s body grew weaker she also suffered from problems with her joints. “It made walking painful. When I was at school and we would write everything by hand, that was dficult. “I was very unwell and very malnourished.”  On top of the physical effects of anorexia, Rachel’s mental health was at an all-time low. “I always say an eating disorder sucks the le out of you. It’s like the colour had drained out of my le,” she recalled. “I was super anxious all the time, thinking about what to eat and when to eat. Those thoughts just circulate around your head.” Rachel added she was depressed and felt isolated from her friends because so much of a teenager’s social le revolves around food - for example, going to the cinema and ordering a bucket of popcorn. “Lots of teens do that kind of thing but I struggled to take part in it,” she said. After her trip to AE, Rachel says she realised she didn’t want to die from this illness and started on a long journey to recovery. She was put in touch with mental health services and began psychotherapy, and was also given a dietician to help her with things like meal planning. “It’s been  years and I’m still working on it,” she explained. “I’ve definitely had some ups and there have been times when physically and mentally I’ve been really well.  “But anorexia is an illness that can come back unfortunately, and it did for me.” She added waiting lists for people who need support with eating disorder recovery are sky-high, and demand has also gone up since the beginning of the pandemic. In December , the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health warned there had been a huge rise in cases of anorexia nervosa in children over the previous year. Some paediatricians claimed they had seen cases quadruple as they issued a stark warning to parents to look out for the signs of eating disorders in their children. Against this backdrop, Rachel decided to pay for private treatment to help her in recovery - which she says is going well. But for others who need support, she argued the government’s initiative to force restaurants to put calories on their menu will stunt their recovery.  “I don’t think there’s anyone who stands to benefit from this policy,” she said. “It should be withdrawn immediately. The government has already been warned about this. It’s going to be super damaging. She added: “Part of eating disorder treatment is going out to eat and not knowing exactly what’s in your meal. “It’s about getting used to the idea that it’s ok not to know everything. “It’s going to be even harder to eat out than it is already. It’s going to make those challenges in treatment even worse and it can lead to anxiety.” Rachel also pointed out thatcalories are on the menu in a restaurant, this will no doubt prompt conversation around the table about calorie counts, which can be incredibly triggering to people suffering from an eating disorder. “We try to minimise exposure to those conversations, butyou’re in a large group and you’re the only person with an eating disorder, it’s not easy to ask everyone to stop talking about it,” she explained. “We’ve just come out of the pandemic and there’s a huge rise in the number of people with eating disorders, combined with chronic underfunding. “Now the government has slapped this on top of it.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been contacted for comment.

Manager Karen Noble is on a mission to make sure people are getting the support and benefits they need – and this is particularly important for older visitors, who might feel isolated. “It’s not just about organising activities they can get involved with: conversations might come out of that,” says Karen. “People will tell you what they’re struggling with and how you can support them. You might find out that they’ve been given an iPad but have no internet connection, or that they don’t feel safe because some kids have been throwing eggs in the streets. “We have a lot of older people who shouldbe receiving benefits but they’re not. So we want to get that message out to them. They’ll go ‘No, I’m alright’ because there is a bit of pride there – but we want to make sure they get everything they’re entitled to.”Karen is devoted to helping people in the local community because she knows what it’s like to struggle. As a young mum of two, she worked and had to battle to support her children. “I had to fight to make sure I got all the right benefits – and then people saw what I did and started coming to me for help,” says Karen.

It’s now rising by % this month. So, Emilyaposs mum suggested she invest in a heated airer to see whether it would cost less to dry her clothes than using the tumble dryer - and Dunelmaposs version fit the bill. Priced at £, the three-tier airer is made from aluminium and is suitable for up to kg of washing. It’s supplied with an additional storage rack, has room to hang plenty of clothes and is easy to fold away despite its fairly large size.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I can manage about a wash and a half on the rack depending on what’s been washed, and it takes seconds to heat up, Emily says. The warmth of the airer also doubles up as a heater, which makes my spare room nice and warmIt’s a real pain to rely on British weather when you’re wanting to hang your washing out, which is why this heated airer is such a great addition to my household items. All I need to do is put a wash on after work and stick it on the airer overnight and it’s usually dry in the morning.Although you’re not getting that fresh ‘outside’ smell like you wouldyou were to hang it out, the airer still leaves your clothes feeling soft and smelling fresh. The only downside is the fact that the towels do feel hard once they’ve been dried overnight, which is something I’m still trying to find a solution to.It costs from p an hour to run, saving around p with the latest % increase this month. As the phrase goes aposevery little helpsapos, and the heated airer could save around £.I were to use it five days a week adding up to around £. a month. Emily aposhasnapost looked backapos since purchasing her heated airer, and while doing the washing is still a chore, itaposs a lot easier now. I’ve learnt it’s all about the placement of the clothes, as sometimes they don’t always dry properlythey’re not hung up correctly.It may seem a bit steep for £, but I truly believe in the long run it’s going to save me a lot of money, and it’s such a handy product.

She said she spotted the girl at passport control and that she told officials her name was Leah, but it is still unknownit was definitely her.The family have previously spoken out against upsetting and hurtful claims made about the then -year-oldaposs disappearance, especially some made on social media. She said: My first thought was ‘what a lovely young girl’ and my second was that the man she was with was being very controlling. The girl was asking him questions about what they would do when they arrived and where they would stay. She seemed worried. The man kept telling her: ’You’ll find out that when you get there.’ His tone was not nice.” The businesswoman added it “didn’t make sense” to her, and as a mum she couldn’t help worrying about the young girl.  She lived in Holland at the time and was unaware of Leah Croucher’s case until six months later when she moved to the UK.It was only then she saw giant missing persons banners that Leah’s family had put out on bridges.She insisted that it was Leah at the airport, describing her “auburn colour” hair, that was long thick and wavy.

I am ft in tall and I would put her at about my height.” The man was described as Asian, with black hair gelled back and a trimmed beard in his late s or early s but she could not remember where they were travelling to. Back in January, Thames Valley Policeaposs DCI Andy Howard said: There is no evidence to suggests that she has left the UK.Since she went missing there have been a number of reports of the missing girl. Last year an old photo showed a figure in black on a mobile phone, and it was hoped to provide clues as to her disappearance.This came after a satellite photo on Google Earth was claimed by some to show a girl resembling the teen.Officers also investigated reports of a woman crying at a lake in November.Police appealed for anyone who knew anything about the disappearance to contact police on  or Crimestoppers anonymously on   , adding that there was a £, reward for information.

Image: Daily Echo Solent NewsByLiam Buckler:,  Apr |commentsA retired milkman claims he has been unable to shower or bath for two years due to council delays in installing a shower in his flat.Michael Davey, , from Southampton, struggles to get upstairs due to his arthritis and other health issues. He can no longer use the bath and instead relies on bed baths given to him by his we Stella.The father of two approached Southampton City Council back in  to install a shower in the bathroom due to his health issues, but no work has been undertaken. He said: I was told Iaposd have to move to another property before any internal adaptations would take place, but none of the homes I viewed online was suitable for a disabled person. I havenapost had a shower or bath in two years. I feel Iaposve been ignored by the council.In order to fund improvements, people applying for a means-tested Disabled Facilities Grant must have their needs assessed by an occupational therapist. And Southampton is one of ten council areas in England and Wales where disabled people wait on average more than a year before they can submit an application, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism . Once applicants apply, they can then wait a further  months for the work to be started, which for Michael is a long time to wait. Fazilet Hadi, of Disability Rights UK, said disabled people often found it dficult to complete simple everyday actions that others took for granted. Itaposs critical that councils keep this at the front of their minds when telling disabled people there is a wait of months for adaptations. A Southampton City Council spokesperson today cited the high demand for alterations to properties. Long waits can often be due to special or complex situations but we aim to deal with critical cases within four weeks. The councilworking very hard and pushing to reduce waiting times where possible. aposaposThe pandemic has added additional pressures with increased staff absences and home visits restricted so we could protect the people we work with, causing delays to assessments, approvals and completion of works. Southampton City council declined to disclose how many people are on the waiting list but said the list is easing. In order for properties occupied by people with mobility issues, they are often funded by a Disabled Facilities Grant. In  a report published to say the means-tested grants had helped more than , people a year to live in more accessible housing since its inception in . However, there is a long wait before someone disabled can apply for funding as their needs must be assessed by an occupational therapist, with thousands of disabled people across the UK are waiting months to be assessed - and waiting possibly years to have the work completed.A Southampton City Council spokesperson said: Disabled Facilities Grant cases are often complex and the time taken from initial application to approval and subsequent completion will y considerably depending on the scale of the works and the needs of the inidual. Additional resources are being recruited across the teams and a large-scale service review is underway to identy improvements to service delivery. This has lead to campaigners calling for an increase in the number of purpose-built houses to be built for the disabled, as applicants can be forced to wait years. The Disability charity Leonard Cheshire says people in two thirds of English council areas wait longer than a year, with a quarter of council areas waiting more than two years. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said, We recognise the importance of improving accessibility, and the number of accessible homes has nearly doubled in a decade. Councils are best placed to decide how much accessible housing is needed in their area and they should reflect this in their plans for future development.

Millions of people in the UK have been left worried about the huge hike in energy costs that has left some going cold as they canapost afford to put on the heating.But Martin has come up with a list of ways to stay warm without resorting to putting on central heating, reported the Manchester Evening News.In a change from his normal advice about cutting costs, he has been forced to suggest more desperate methods. The Good Morning Britain expert pointed out how people can wear heated USB gloves, hand warmers, an electric gilet or an electric blanket to get warm without having to heat the entire house.  His guide also told of the benefits of layered clothing and thermal tops while eating food regularly keeps people warmer. Martin said: I felt sad asking my team to put this together, but my email bag is full of folk so desperate they canapost put the heat on, I wanted to try some help. Pls share. Full cost of living survival guide coming soon Martin added on his site: This is a guide I really wish we needn’t be publishing. The reason I asked Sarah and the team to put this together is due to my overflowing e-mail bag of desperation from people who can’t afford their energy bills. So don’t see this as an ‘MSE or Martin says you should do this’. Itaposs more that we’re trying to help provide some options and information for those that may need to drastically cut down on energy usage due to financial desperation and some help for others who may want to do it out of a commitment to green issues.  Martin pointed out in his guide that it costs only £ to buy a cheap electric blanket which in turn, costs p an hour to run, even in todayaposs climate of rising costs. That equals a cost per week of £.used for seven hours a day. An electric gilet, basically a heated jacket, would cost £ to buy and just p per week to run, while USB gloves would cost p per week to run and just £ to buy. Another consumer expert Jack Monroe reached out to Martin Lewis for the guide, adding: Thank you for your vital and heart breaking service, friend. I know this is taking a hell of a toll on you, please please take care of yourself out here. We need you now more than ever, but we need you well and fit for what’s to come.  Martin responded: What lovely words - thanks Jack. Yes Iaposm feeling the pressure, but thataposs trivial compared to the trauma many are facing being unable to afford to live. Martinaposs loyal legion of followers praised the tips, but expressed their disbelief that they were necessary in one of the worldaposs largest economies.Jon Wilson said: Good tips but itaposs  in one of the worldaposs wealthiest economies  weaposre one step away from the Universal Credit journal suggesting claimants Google how Bear Grylls went about sleeping in a deer carcass to keep warm.

She was alarmed when it seemed to show she might have leukaemia so made an appointment at her local health centre. Doctors disagreed with her self-diagnosis, giving her beta-blockers and arranging blood tests the following week.Two days later she woke to find her gums bleeding so called Craigavon Hospital and was advised to come to AE where tests confirmed she had acute myeloid leukaemia, Belfast Live reported.Chillingly, she was told had she waited another two days for tests as she had been advised, she may have died. The mum of two said: “I had a feeling in the back of my head that things weren’t right.  “A short time after arriving at the hospital, I received a blood test. The results came back very quickly and when both a doctor and nurse came to talk to me. I just knew it was serious. I was advised to go to the City Hospital in Belfast right away and on arrival was met by a consultant and nurse who admitted me immediately and broke the news that I might have leukaemia. I cried and the first stupid question I asked was, ‘Am I going to lose my hair ’ My thinking was thatI lost my hair, the girls would know I was really ill, so I would have to tell them the truth. Chemotherapy treatment started immediately between February and September , the young mum had intense chemotherapy and tests showed her bone marrow was clear of cancer. There was another blow in December when further tests revealed the leukaemia was back. She underwent a stem cell transplant from her sister, Alison and stayed in quarantine for three months while receiving full body radiation and chemotherapy injections. Unable to continue working, she now spends her time taking care of daughters Lily , and Meabh, , whilst attending hospital on a regular basis for checks. She added: “I am so grateful to everyone who helped me, giving me more precious time with my girls. On the th of this month, I will be three years post-transplant. I call this my other birthday, so I will be three. There is one thing I would like to say to anyone going through a cancer journey right now. You will have days when you are feeling sick, or perhaps feeling down, try to stay positive. Remember that no matter how rough a day you are having there is always someone worse.

Lynda Walker, who suffered with a hip problem for three years and was waiting for treatment, had to leave work for fourth months.She had asked for a new chair as the one she had been using was not suitable because it exacerbated her pain and discomfort, the hearing was told. In order to help alleviate some of her pain, Mrs Walker had asked for the arms of her chair to be removed but engineer, Christopher Hoey, was reluctant to do this as they were screwed on and he thought it would make the chair faulty, the  heard. The company, Modular Office  Storage Systems Limited based in Tyne and Wear, failed to carry out a workplace assessment to establish whether a dferent chair or desk would have helped Mrs Walkerto work.  After complaining of pain in her back, she asked for an informal meeting with bosses, where Mrs Walker said she was in great pain and was unable to sit or walk. She suggested a new or adapted chair would help, the tribunal heard. However, she later received a letter inviting her to an absence meeting which warned her the company was finding it dficult to cover her absence and may not be able to hold her job open, the  was told. Because of the busy months without her, the company had reached a decision to sack Mrs Walker due to long term ill health despite her being fit to work just five days later, the  was told. Mrs Walker has successfully sued the company after a tribunal found in her favour that a suitable chair would have meant she could have ed to work sooner.  She joined in January  where she initially did admin work before becoming office manager. Part of a small team, she was one of six full-time employees as well as directors Bernard McWilliams and John Rimington. The tribunal heard she went off sick for a week in May  due to hip bursitis, an inflammation of the bursa which is a sac which reduces friction in the body. In addition, she went off for a fortnight due to hip and back pain in October, followed by a certied five months off, with the final certicate due to expire in March . An occupational health report was carried in December  which found she had endured pain in her left hip for up to three years and was on medication. Read MoreSome of the report said: Her reason for absence is the high level of pain that interferes severely with concentration and at the same time the medication she was prescribed makes her sleep during the day, overall she feels unable to do her work and she is worried her performance could be inadequate. She requested a desk assessment because she feels she can benefit from a better chair and desk reposition, the current setup appears to aggravate her symptoms and complaints. Mrs Walker was fit to work but needed advice on how to deal with the symptoms and pain, the tribunal heard. She was upset and felt bosses did not want her toand were using her period of absence as an opportunity to dismiss her or renew their efforts to pressure her into retirement. She was sacked for long term ill health in February  with the company claiming that even with modication, they could not foresee ato work date. The tribunal was told she later appealed this dismissal, claiming an injection she would receive at Sunderland Royal Hospital meant she would be able toto work. However, the company rejected this despite her being effectively fit toto work from March   when her employment had ended on March . Mrs Walker decided to sue, claiming unfair dismissal and unlawful disability discrimination and winning both. During the tribunal her boss, Mr Rimington, said: Itaposs important to understand how busy we were, because when Lyndaaposs absence started we had to pick up her duties. It was a huge strain that as time passed became more dficult to manage. It was clear that all staff were struggling. The  found that no attempts had been made to replace Mrs Walker such as through an agency when she was off sick, nor had her role been filled following her dismissal. Employment Judge Gerald Johnson concluded: [Mrs Walker] maintainedthat a more suitable chair and desk would probably mean that [she] would be able toto work sooner to undertake her duties. [The company] failed to address its mind to the possibility of making that adjustment.

She recommends that people interested in pet rats from her have threeJem Quarrys rats have won prizes Image: collectByNatasha Wynarczyk:,  Apr |commentsThey’re vermin, pests, plague carriers, the stars of horror novels, not to mention many nightmares, and even a right royal pantomime villain.So are the RSPCA squeaking up the wrong tree with the news we’re being encouraged to have rats in the home as pets Not according to the existing rat fans , who already own , pet rats in the UK... The rat breeder Around  years ago, Marti Leimbach was in the pet section of London department store Harrods buying dog food when she saw two “beautul” rats which she had to have. Since clapping her eye on Chester and Archie, Marti estimates she has gone on to keep “hundreds” of the rodents. She currently has nine living in her Oxford home.For the past four years, Marti, , has also been breeding rats as a hobby under the name Blue Apple Rattery.Marti recommends that people interested in pet rats from her have three. “That way,one dies the remaining two have each other,” she says. “Rats don’t like being alone, they thrive in company. They are smart, active social pets that become very attached to their owners and to one another - they are very similar to dogs in that regard. “I home out rats to people that can give them loving and thoughtful homes that will give these remarkable creatures the care they need.” Marti’s rats have also won prizes at NFRS shows. “There’s dferent categories, just like there are at dog shows,” says Marti. “For example, all the rats that have a single colour coat will be in one group. People can be surprised when they find out rat shows exist.”High-fiving rodents In , two clever rodents, Frankie and Freddie, made it into that year’s Guinness World Record book for their remarkable tricks. Frankie set the World Record for the most high fives by a rat in  seconds, an impressive . Meanwhile, Freddie secured himself the accolade for the most jumps through a hoop by a rat in the same time frame, completing the move eight times. They were trained by Watford-based project manager Luke Roberts, who adopted the duo, who he affectionately refers to as ‘the boys’, when they were pups . He started teaching them tricks when they were around three months old and had settled into their new home. Luke said he was inspired to train his pets after watching a video of a basketball-playing rat online. He added: “It was like a bonding exercise with them. Training small animals which people think are gross can help change public perception of them. “You can turn it into something funny and inspiring. I wish people would give rats more of a chance.” Prize-winning rats Jem Quarry has bred rats at Kismet Stud with her partner Lewis since . She has loved the rodents since getting her first two - Kasper and Cushty - at the age of . Over the past  years, Jem, who is  and lives near Northampton, estimates she has spent £, entering her rats into National Fancy Rat Society shows - a rodent version of Crufts. Several of her rats including Apple Crumble, Clanger and Poundcake have netted Best in Show rosettes, cups and even a rodent-shaped trophy. Jem says a few qualities that make a prize-winning rat stand out. “What you’re looking for is a rat who is very fit, has a nice, shiny sleek coat, has nice bold eyes and is a good colour.” Jem, who also qualied as a NFRS show judge herself in  says: “I travel all over the country entering my rats into a few a year. You have to feed them a good dietyou want them to do well, as part of the judging involves them having shiny, sleek coats and being fit.” Jem and Lewis are currently looking after  rats including babies. “They all have dferent personalities,” she says. “People are starting to warm up to rats as good pets. On social media there’s a lot of videos of them being interactive and very cute, which is changing perceptions of them.”  TV star rats Animal trainer Grace Dickinson currently has  rats - nine brown ones and two ‘blue dumbos’ - which she’s trained to do tricks for film and TV.“My group of nine boys are what I call my ‘stunt rats’,” says Grace, who is  and lives in Chelmsford. “They look like wild rats, so they’ve appeared on screen playing street rats and dungeon rats. Recently, they were in the second series of Netflix show The Witcher.” Grace’s blue rats Stanley and Gus were also in recent ITV show The Secret Le of Our Pets, where they learned to squeeze through holes, run along ledges and go from A to B points.“How long it takes to train them depends on their personalities,” says Grace. “The first part is gaining their trust and befriending them, such as by getting them to take food from you. “They are so intelligent that you can teach them basic stuff in just a few short sessions. Once they’ve got the first thing in the bag, they realise it’s fun and learning everything  will come relatively quickly. Like the RSPCA, Grace says she recommends rats as pets, especially over more traditional choices such as hamsters and rabbits. “Rats are a lot bolder and happier around human company,” she adds. “They love coming out and being handled. Really, they are just like little people.”  Therapy rats Nicola Jackson is the proud owner of nine rats, and finds them very useful when dealing with cold doorstep callers. “Keeping rats has stopped people trying to sell me things on my doorstep - not many people like it when I answer the door with one on my shoulder,” she says. Two years ago charity worker Nicola had  rats living with her, in three large cages costing almost £ each. She says: “My rats really helped me in lockdown. I am in a long-distance relationship so I was alone. My rat Saturn, who died at the beginning of last year, would knowI had a bad day and would sit on me and cuddle. They’re very intelligent and caring pets.”It wasn’t the first time her beloved rats helped her through a tough time. In November , Nicola Jackson’s mother Karen had a seizure and tragically died in front of her daughter. Nicola, who is  and from Rosyth, Fe, was later diagnosed with PTSD, but says the two rescue rats she had at the time, Shredder and Splinter, helped her cope with her grief. “Without them, I would have just stayed in bed and not interacted with anyone,” says Nicola. “But the bond I had with my rats helped me get through it, even spending an hour playing with them would help me feel a million times better. Nicola says the only negative of keeping the animals is the fact their lespans are so short - they usually live for just two to three years. “I got a certicate for longevity for my girl Poppy, as she made it to four years,” says Nicola. “She was the longest I ever had. “Every time you have to say goodbye to them it’s very tough.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Harrods Inc.RSPCALovePoppiesWorld recordsAdoptionTherapyAnimalsPantomimesDaily MirrorGiant rats,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Conservative MP Greg Hands was asked about the government’s plans to help provide greener fuels for people and he also outlined the steps that were being made to help people deal with the cost of living crisis.Mr Hands referred to a £ billion package that Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed last February where a one-off repayable £ discount and a rebate on council tax bills would help tackle the £-a-year rise in average household’s energy bills in April. The Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth said the £ discount was not just a loan. He told the Question Time audience: The Chancellor of the Exchequer launched a really important package in February, just two months ago to deal with the rise in bills, not deal with it completely, but actually £ billion set aside, a £ discount on energy bills, a £ discount on council tax, additional funds to make sure the most vulnerable are able ... give them assistance in paying their energy.” At that point presenter Fiona Bruce jumped in saying: £ is of course a loan  And Mr Hands replied: It is not a loan, it is a discount which you have to pay it back in the form of a levy. Ms Bruce persisted: But you have to pay it back, it sounds like a loan   The government minister continued: Not the inidual, it gets taken back at the point that it is levied. With laughs and shouts from the audience, Ms Bruce said to them: You are all shouting, what are you all shouting  They yelled back: It’s a loan. Mr Hands kept going: It’s taken back through a levy, it is not a loan because it does not create an obligation on the inidual to repay, it is actually a levy on the price point. He added: It is put on the price point, not on the inidual. The inidual does not have an obligation to repay. Askedpeople didnapost have to repaythey didnapost want he responded with members of the audience chuckling: No I’m not saying that.  At that point Labour MP Emily Thornberry said: Soyou don’t heat,you don’t have any heating afterwards then you don’t pay it back. It is not an obligation, said Mr Hands. These are the important things which have been announced to help people with bills. But that is dferent to the long term strategy that we have launched today with renewables, nuclear and making sure we are not increasing our imports of oil and gas.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also had to defend the government over claims that the new energy strategy doesnapost help people with soaring bills.He said the strategy - which sets out aims to boost new nuclear power, offshore wind and hydrogen - is a long-term plan focusing on energy supply, undoing the mistakes of the past and taking the big decisions now. He said the Government was already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more. The latest investment will support research, development and deployment of cutting-edge technologies, the Government said, adding that it was also publishing a range of important documents and guidelines to support the development of these industries. A financial package, announced last Friday, includes £ million to fund low carbon hydrogen production projects, £ million towards the acceleration of Carbon Capture and StorageTechnologies, and a £. million competition for bidders to develop a UK Advanced Modular Reactor .

Normally, this is the kind of thing that would make me burst into laughter. But instead, I am completely calm and still, barely acknowledging the downright bizarre experience I’m currently having. In fact, I have been put into a trance.The person guiding me through it is The Iceman Wim Hof. The Dutch adrenaline junkie claims his breathing exercises can allow people to withstand cold temperatures and unlock a host of health benefits from better sleep to reducing inflammation in the body and lessening the chances of developing heart disease.He even credits his Wim Hof Method, which he created with son Enahm, with allowing him to achieve feats that are unthinkable for a human being to do.  He holds  Guinness World records, has climbed up the ,ft to Mount Everest’s death zone while bare-chested in shorts, spent almost two hours in an ice bath and reached the top of Mount Kilimanjaro in less than two hours, again wearing just shorts and shoes. “I can do what scientists thought is impossible,” Wim, , says. “I did all those records just by learning to control my breathing. This method is very effective. Anybody can do it.” We’ll soon find outthat’s true. Eight celebrities including Gabby Logan, Tamzin Outhwaite and Alfie Boe are set to try Wim’s method out for a new six-part reality series, Freeze the Fear with Wim Hof, which starts next week. Presented by Holly Willoughby and Lee Mack, the famous faces move to a camp in the mountains of Northern Italy, where they face a series of cold challenges to “push their minds and bodies to the limit”.Instead of Italy, Brockwell Lido in South London will be where I get a taste of what they experience – being immersed in cold water. But first, I have to learn how to breathe properly, what Wim calls “the first pillar” of his method.  Wim says: “I do my breathing every day and still feel like I could take on the world. I never get tired. Tiredness gets tired of me! The oldest person I train is  years old, she started with me when she was . I’ve seen miracles.” His exercises involve a cycle of  repetitions of breathing quickly in and out – but not hyperventilating – doing a big exhale and then holding your breath. I manage to hold my breath for almost a minute and a half without really trying. It’s not quite on the level of Wim, who has held his for six minutes, but it surprises me. As I come round from my trance  minutes later, I feel lightheaded and my feet and hands are tingling. While this would normally cause me a lot of anxiety, I am completely at peace with it.  When I breathe out, the air feels very clear. Although I’m in a heated room, my breath tastes very fresh, like when you step outside on a clear, crisp day and take in a massive lungful of oxygen. “You were very committed to the breathing,” says Wim. “Anybody can do these exercises, anywhere. On a sofa, in bed, it’s very powerful.” Breathing done and feeling tranquil, it’s time for Wim and I to go into the pool, which is eight degrees. It’s a little warmer than the one the celebrities e into in episode one of Freeze the Fear. That is closer to freezing and there’s visible ice – the temperature outside their pool is a bitter minus six.  Wim and I stand by the water where he starts shouting “do you feel strong ” which is slightly unnerving – but when I reply with “yes” he says: “let’s go.” “I usually tell people to ease themselves slowly into cold water for the first time,” Wim adds. However, I’m feeling brave after the breathing exercises - and I pride myself on being good in chilly temperatures. I grew up in Newcastle and have had many a snowy, winter night out in the stereotypical Geordie girl unorm of a short dress with no tights or coat. “I’m going to jump in,” I tell Wim firmly, and we both throw ourselves into the water. But the minute I hit the water my body betrays me and I start hyperventilating against my will.  It’s extremely embarrassing and I want to get out, but Wim guides me to the side of the pool, saying: “let’s relax.” “Take a deep breath,” he encourages. “You’re doing good. Inhale, exhale.” After a couple of rounds, I ease up and even start laughing at myself. “If you use your mindset well, you will be able to control stress and push it away,” says Wim. “It’s what you have done. The cold is a force, but we are stronger than it.” Wim has always been drawn to the cold, telling me that as a teenager he had a sudden urge to jump into the icy water of Amsterdam’s Beatrixpark canal.  But it was after the death of the mother of four of Wim’s six children, his first we Olaya, that he started going into cold temperatures regularly. Olaya took her own le in  following a long period of mental illness, and Wim needed to combat the pain. He says: “In the cold water, you don’t feel the emotional agony, you don’t feel anything – you’re just surviving. “You have to adapt, so the thinking stops and your body takes over. That’s what I learned, and that gave me a little bit of relief, which was enough.” The breathing came later, when he discovered that by breathing deeper and more mindfully he was able to withstand cold temperatures for longer. For over a decade, Wim says he has “made millions” from training people and has coached A-listers such as Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford and Tom Cruise. And a Hollywood movie is in the pipeline, starring Joseph Fiennes as Wim.  However, despite his massive popularity, Wim has garnered scepticism from doctors due to claims that his method has reduced symptoms of illnesses such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease – with no scientic proof.Yet, its clear he is on to something . Just an hour after following Wim’s breathing techniques and swimming in the glacial water I was a completely dferent person - wide awake and elated.Wim calls it “getting high off your own supply”. He adds: “You’ve been able to tap into your own power today. I want people in their living rooms to watch the show, and think, ‘I can do that too’. I want to change the world.” Freeze the Fear with Wim Hof starts on Tuesday at pm on BBC One.

As tensions surrounding his tell-all memoir which is due to be published in the autumn rise, royal expert Mrs Schofield says as his grandmother ages, the need to make things better grows greater. She told the Express: “I don’t think that there’s any room to heal at this point because there’s so much pushback from the Sussexes. “I just feel like there’s so much animosity right now that they’re considered outsiders.  “We don’t have much time left with the Queen and I wish that he [Harry] would heal the broken wounds that are happening right now so that we can look in the future and one day hopefully see Harry and Meghan within the fold, maybe not working royals, but invited for holidays, invited for Christmas.” The couple have yet to confirmthey will be back in Britain for the Queenaposs big celebrations. But the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are said to be apostop of Victoria and David Beckhamaposs guestlistapos for their son Brooklyn Beckhamaposs wedding to Nicola Peltz in Florida this weekend.

The -year-old teacher told pals she normally avoided walking through Cator Park in South East London at night but cut through because she was rushing to meet a friend at Depot bar on September . Koci Selamaj, , had lain in wait at the park for  minutes with his hood up, before he struck Sabina with an emergency traffic triangle and dragged her into the bushes. He then strangled her in the undergrowth and left her body to be discovered by a dog walker  hours later.  Alison Morgan QC told the court today: It was out of character for Sabina to walk in Cator Park after dark. Sabina had discussed being concerned about being there after dark. Ms Morgan said: It seems likely that she chose to walk across the park that night because she was running late and this was the quickest route to get to the Depot Bar. Selamaj, an Albanian national from Eastbourne, East Sussex, was arrested on September  after being recognised on CCTV.  The clip showed him running towards Sabina and “striking her repeatedly”, before carrying her out of sight and later emerging to pick up pieces of the weapon. Sabinaaposs body was found nearly  hours later by a dog walker hidden underneath a pile of grass. Selamaj admitted murder last month and faces le in prison, but today refused to attend court. Members of his victimaposs family gathered at the Old Bailey this afternoon, with supporters of the Sabina Project also outside holding placards.  Mr Justice Sweeney said the sentencing could go ahead in the absence of the defendant as the court had no power to force him to attend. The judge noted a le sentence was inevitable with a starting point of a minimum term of  years. The defendant had also been captured on CCTV footage stalking the hotel lobby of a five-star hotel where his we worked just hours before setting his murderous sights on Sabina. Garage worker Selamaj planned the savage murder after being rejected by his we in his home town of Eastbourne.  He murdered the primary school teacher just weeks after his we left him due to his domestic abuse, which included him “throttling” her at least three times. Selamaj tried to persuade his we to have sex with him just hours before his attack, but she refused. The defendant booked a £ room at The Grand Hotel in Eastbourne, located five minutes from his home. Ms Morgan told the court today the booking was indicative of his premeditation to have some kind of sexual encounter that evening. Selamaj will be sentenced tomorrow at the Old Bailey.

Damilya left a suicide note which read: Alessio I love you, sorry. Another said: Mommy and Daddy Iaposm sorry. Hours before her death, Damilya and Alessio had fought outside his flat and he pushed her into a fountain, Inner West London Coroneraposs Court heard. Recording a narrative verdict, assistant coroner Bernard Richmond said: This is a tragic case. Her mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed an intention to kill herself.Electronic devices showed she had been searching for methods of suicides, terraces and heights, the inquest heard. There had been a rapid deterioration in her mental health in the last few days, the coroner said. She was in a very disturbed state immediately prior to her death. The coroner confirmed Damilyaaposs injuries were consistent with a fall from a great height. He said there were no injuries, indicative of assault or restraint by a third party. The coroner said Damilya had suffered stress, depression and anxiety due to a numberfactors, including her relationship with her family, her own drug and alcohol use, dficulties in coping with her degree course and her relationship with her boyfriend. The coroner described how Damilya had tried to take her own le twice before and was stopped from doing so. She said that by June ,  the studentaposs mental state had signicantly deteriorated. Shortly before she died at .am, Damilyaaposs mind was plainly disturbed and in that state she formed that intention to kill herself evidenced by goodbye notes to her parents and partner.  Alessio, who was born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and Damilya, who was from Kazakhstan, had been in an on-off relationship for two-and-a-half years. They met at Regentaposs University in  where they were both studying business. Alessio said: She was a sweet girl. We had similar personalities. We had similar backgrounds. The coupleaposs friends were aware of their tumultuous relationship and Alessio had reported her to police himself on several occasions, when she had scratched him and she had attempted suicide. He told the inquest he had prevented a suicide attempt by Ms in September . The court heard they were both using drugs, including cocaine, cannabis and ketamine, as well as alcohol. She was sent a video recording on WhatsApp of her in the phone booth in north London, on May , . Attached was a message saying: I am going to keep destroying you. One of her friends received the same clip from three dferent numbers, with one containing the threat: I will f**k you up next, my love. Alessio claimed she had been spreading rumours about him and he sent the sex video to make her stop.I just felt I had been done wrong and I wanted to get revenge, he said. She had been spreading dangerous rumours.aposItaposs the worst thing I have ever done. My regret is sincere. I acknowledge how foolish a reaction it was. In hindsight it was a stupid, childish and immature and I regret it more than anything I ever did. Damilya reported the sending of the revenge porn to police. I found it really insulting and humiliating, I think heaposs doing this for revenge because of the argument, she explained. I am still in shock and feel broken.She said she was very scared mentally and physically because Alessio had threatened to send the porn video, as well as footage of her taking cocaine, to her Muslim family. Damilya told police that there had been a row at his apartment on May  and he had grabbed her by the throat, struck her four or five times, spat on her and that she had passed out for a few seconds. But the relationship continued even after she went to the police. On June  the pair went out drinking with friends, arriving back at Alessioaposs apartment at around .pm. They had an argument before Alessio pushed Ms Jussipaliyeva into the water feature in front of the building. The violence outside the building lasted for over half an hour before the concierge called police in the early hours of June . The next day he received distraught text messages from Damilya. He called police who went to his flat and then to her apartment in South Wharf Road, Paddington where Damilya was found lying dead on the ground outside. In April  Alessio was spared jail after admitting disclosing private sexual photographs and films with intent to cause distress and one count of assault by beating. Alessio was handed a -week suspended sentence, ordered to carry out a rehabilitation activity requirement and made to pay £ costs. His defence barrister Steven Powles had said before he was sentenced: It was a dficult relationship, both were immature and at times, jealous of each other. The sight of his lover crumpled on the pavement had a lasting impact on Alessio, who has received treatment at the Nightingale Hospital for PTSD and complex bereavement disorder. He has lost someone who he loved and someone he intended to marry, Mr Powles told the court. Damilyaaposs family, from Kazakhstan, earlier said in a statement: We cannot describe the pain we feel of losing our beloved Damilya. She was such an adorable, wonderful, loving, caring and intelligent girl. She loves everyone with all of her heart and tried to see the good in everyone she encountered. We are heartbroken to hear the details of the abuse and torment in which our daughter had to endure because of Mr Bianchi. She had a bright future ahead of her and had so many dreams and aspirations to accomplish great things. While we mourn the loss of a very good girl, we also celebrate her remarkable le and hope that the memory will live on in all that know her.

Archie Manners and Josh Pieters, who have almost . million channel subscribers, managed to make off with £ worth of food after outwitting the unmanned and cashierless shop.Their latest video shows how they got around more than , sensors watching their every move and scales on the shelves at an Amazon Fresh store in London.They pulled off the trick by purchasing the same items at Sainsburyaposs before replacing them with sand and water so they were then able to put the fake items on the Amazon Fresh shelves.What do you make of this prank  Have your say in the comment sectionArchie told the Times that they spoke to a lawyer before pulling off the audacious stunt and were advised it was not illegal because they did not intend to permanently deprive Amazon of the items.Before attempting the trick, they investigated the store and worked out Amazon is aware you have picked up a product because of the scales on the shelves.  Josh said: When I pick it up it knows Iaposve picked it up andI walk out with it it knows Iaposve pick it up and will charge it to my Amazon account. If I put it back it knows itaposs been put back and I wonapost get charged. Before making their move, they cased the Amazon Fresh shop, demonstrating in the video thatyou pick up an item from a shelve, which has scales, Amazon knows you have picked up the product.  It was then that they put their plan into action and ed to the store with a haul of replacement items, bought at another supermarket, filled with sand and water to fool the scales. Using the fake name Robert Da Shop, they then proceeded to walk out with items including a Cadburyaposs Easter egg, a packet of Kelloggaposs Fruit aposnapos Fibre, a Pot Noodle, kettle crisps, Heinz cream of tomato packet soup and a bottle of wine. They then went back to Sainsburyaposs to get a refund on the original food items.  Josh added: If anything, weaposre showing Amazon where there might be vulnerabilities in their system and where they might need to tighten things up so this doesnapost happen in the future. As we said in the video, we wouldnapost encourage anyone to do this soanything, maybe it was just a bit of free help to Amazon. Looking at it, you might take the opinion that man can outwit machines but also big companies might want to think twice before getting rid of their human workforces, because perhaps a human is better at keeping a shop order than a machine is right now.  They sent a friend back to Amazon Fresh to buy back the items to make sure a regular customer did not mistakenly purchase the sand-filled items by mistake. The duo previously achieved national news headlines when they tricked the anti-vaxxer Piers Corbyn into accepting a bundle of fake cash to stop criticising the AstraZeneca Covid jab.

Victorya Venise, from Lousianna, USA, was planning on giving up her son for adoption and didnapost think she was going into labour. She simply thought she had the same stomach bug that had been plaguing her -year-old daughter. However, after she went to the bathroom, she quickly realised that she wasn’t sick, but was moments away from giving birth, local police said. Victorya had to scoop her newborn from out of the toilet and dry him off.  Speaking to WXIA-TV, she said: “I turned around, and it was the baby, and I was like ‘gasp.’ I hurried up, and I grabbed him out of the toilet. “I found a towel and I wrapped him up. I was sitting on the toilet and I called my mom. “ I was like ‘mom, I just had the baby.’ I was like ‘he fell in the toilet.’ She was like, ‘Call , call .” The baby, named Rocky, was treated at a local hospital and discharged in a good condition later that day, despite the dangerous delivery. The single mum had been planning to give the boy up for adoption but has since had a change of heart.She said: “I feel like the experience made me connected to him and made me want to keep him. So I’m going to keep him. “It happened to teach me that you can do this. Even though I’m a single mom, you can take care of him. “It gave me more courage and made me believe I can do this.

The moving object was around ft beneath the surface and about ft long - and spotted in the same place as a supposed dferent sonar sighting of the monster two years ago. Tomaposs screengrab of the sonar has now been accepted by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register as the second spotting of Nessie in .Is Nessie real  Have your say in the comment section Tom said: We decided to take one of the regular cruises from Fort Augustus to get some scenic photos of the loch whilst we are here. At around the half way point , just off Invermoriston, we were alerted to a strange shape forming on the sonar. At first, we thought it was part of the cruise - something for the tourists - but it quickly became apparent that what we were looking at was in real time and big. Iaposd class myself as aposopen mindedapos [about the existence of Nessie], of course we are aware of the myth, but to actually see something big on the sonar like that, took us both by surprise.  At first, we were excited and then puzzled as to what we had seen. It certainly adds to the mystery!In  shocking images of a large creature in the depths of Loch Ness were also allegedly captured on sonar off Invermoriston, by skipper Ronald Mackenzie aboard his Spirit of Loch Ness tourist boat.They were said at the time to be the most compelling evidence of the existence of a Loch Ness Monster, with the object estimated to be ft long and ft beneath the water. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersLeading sonar expert Craig Wallace described the sonar images as very curious as there were large, clear and distinct contacts, all strangely near to the loch bed. Nessie expert Steve Feltham, who has set a world record for the longest vigil of looking for the Loch Ness Monster - now  years long - also claimed: The sonar image - together with the previous ones - are now the best evidence of something big and deep down in the loch. Mr Ingramaposs image proves there is something large down there and his image is  percent genuine. That tourist boat has been regularly picking up contacts in that area for the last two years. So some large creature has moved into that territory. This is another step towards finding out what Nessie is.

A non-profit organisation in Indonesia has been preparing baby orangutans for le in the wild by teaching them survival skills such as awareness of dangerous snakes, how to climb trees, build nests and forage for food.The NGO, Borneo Orangutan SurvivalFoundation, takes in orangutans that have been displaced from their forest homes, and they need to be trained before they can be released back into the wild. The keepers teach them by acting out the scenes themselves - leaping back when they spot a snake and causing a panic that makes the great apes shoot up nearby trees. What do you think about the organisationaposs work  Let us know in the comments...Nicola Walpen, the Campaign Officer for the BOS Foundation, said: “They are immediately assessed and treated, before being quarantined and then placed into the appropriate stage of the rehabilitation process. “The youngest orangutans join the Nursery Group, while juveniles are placed in Forest School and are taught the skills they will need to survive in the wild. “They must learn everything about forest le from how to access all the natural foods on offer, to how to build secure nests. Footage of their rehabilitation filmed at the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Center in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, shows the baby orangutans during their courses on how to live in the forest.  They are seen learning how to climb trees and swaying from branches, as well as building nests high up for them to rest and sleep in. The videos also show the staff teaching them how to source food. It shows the orangutans learning how to eat invertebrates from a tree on the forest floor and peeling back the exterior of plants to retrieve the edible inner pith, which are two very important food sources for them. The rescued apes also attend a regular crash course in snake awareness as many can pose dangerous threats to orangutans so knowing how to deal with the reptiles is vital knowledge for the orphans.  Their rehabilitation ensures that they are able to keep themselves safe from predators, identy food sources and move freely throughout the forest. Once the apes become proficient in all necessary survival skills, they are moved to a socialisation complex in large enclosures to learn how to interact with one another. Nicola added: “The final test is when they are moved to a forested, pre-release island where the orangutans have to prove themselves to be capable foragers, adept climbers, innovative nest-builders, and be appropriately wary of humans.  “The proficient candidates are then released at one of three BOS Foundation-managed release sites to be free again. “Our post-release monitoring team follows them regularly, from a distance, to collect valuable behavioural data regarding their adjustment to le in the wild and to intervene should anything go wrong.” The Borneo Orangutan SurvivalFoundation was founded in , by Willie Smits, Peter Karsono, Asctha Boestani Tajudin, and Joe Cuthbertson.  The founders of BOS were inspired to initiate and establish a formal organisation to save orangutans from the illegal wildle trade andthem to the wild. In April , The BOS Foundation gained international attention after its rescue of an albino orangutan, named Alba. Nicola added: “Alba was discovered starving in a cage in Central Kalimantan, where she had been kept as a pet by villagers.

She said: “Together, we can protect orangutans but we MUST act now. “Orangutan conservation is a global issue. If we lose orangutans, we risk losing forests and all le within them.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

The goal settled the Royal Burgh side, and Lewis Montgomery added a brace on  and  minutes.In Mowi South Division , Kilmory ran out - winners against a young Oban Celtic second team at sun-drenched MacRae Park, Lochgilphead.Goals from Sandy Leiper on  minutes and three by Alex Cunninghamsealed the points for the Kilmory.The home side enjoyed a good first half and would be disappointed with aof just two goals. Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage. It did not take long for Craig Speirs to gave the islanders the lead on six minutes, rling home from the angle.Two minutes later Inveraray were level, Neil Campbell showing scoring from  yards.Bute again took the lead in the th minute when Aray failed to clear and Aiden McGregor took advantage.The home side settled into the game after that setback and started to play some decent shinty, though, despite creating numerous chances, the sides went into half time with the score - to Bute.Inveraray started the second half the better of the two sides, giving the youthful Bute side problems settling.With Inveraray pressing it took until the th minute for the equaliser to arrive Neil Campbell again driving the ball home. Bute pressed to find a winner but the Inveraray backline held firm.In the Women#s Camanachd Association Mowi South Division , Dunadd Camanachd scored three goals in either half to defeat Uddingston - at St Ambrose High School in an excellent advert for women#s shinty # both teams fielding young players with a bright future ahead.Dunadd looked slightly nervy starting their first game of the season but a well-taken goal from Eilidh Cameron settled the team.The next  minutes were end-to-end but the Dunadd defence stayed strong with some excellent saves from stand-in goalie Laurene Cameron.At the other end  Eilidh E Cameronwas tenacious and set up Dunadd#s second as she slotted the ball to Rhian McCuaig, who finished superbly for her first goal for the club.Uddingston, though were not going to give up and, after a spell of pressure, Christie Robertson struck an excellent shot straight in the top corner.Dunadd didn#t let heads go down. After some excellent play on the wing, Alice Adair found striker Eilidh Cameron whose shot was judged to be kicked away by the goalie.Cameron didn#t hesitate from the spot and finished low to the goalie#s left.In the second half Dunadd#s experience started to show as they settled into the game.McCuaig completed her brace, Nicola Smyth finished from close in and Cameron went on to get her hat-trick.That winning feeling # Kilmory#s Sandy Leiper in their match against Oban Celtic juniors.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

Kingdom’, launched by herself and Malcolm Bruce MP, referred to the Liberal Democrats’ policy on a Federal UK.‘I suggested that a strengthened and re-born UK, perhaps reinforced by a new symbolism which more accurately reflected the constituent countries might be considered,’ explained Mrs Michie.‘For example, Wales and Northern Ireland are not included in the Union Jack,’ she added.The document stated that, for many, the Union Jack had been ‘devalued’ in modern times by its ‘association with the Tory Party and the National Front’ and the national anthem had been similarly hijacked by the English rugby team.Commented Mrs Michie: ‘The media did not report that the anthem and flag belonged to the Queen and Country and that I was concerned that they were being taken over by some to represent only part of the United Kingdom, for example in sport and other instances of more sinister use.’FIFTY YEARS AGOFrom Budapest, then to Lochgilphead, to play whist and a visit to Mid Argyll

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":null,"title":"galaxy-smarties-see-easter-eggs-least-sugar","story":"Expressdentist was intrigued to find out which Easter eggs could be the best and worst for your teeth, based on sugar content, so it investigated to see what the worst for sugar content is, so you don’t need to avoid all sweet treats this Easter.Coming in the joint top spot for the Easter eggs worst for your teeth are Galaxy Ripple and Galaxy Minstrels Easter Eggs with g of sugar per g.Although two Mars Galaxy products take the top spot, the other two Mars Galaxy productsrank respectively th and nd.: I tried Aldis new Easter egg range - but which ones are worth buying In second place is the Smarties Easter Egg with .g of sugar per g.

I called the doctor and I thought I was speaking normally, but the doctor couldn’t understand me and knew something was wrong.“I couldn’t speak properly, and I could only recognise my sons. “I didn’t know the words for anything, like bed or cup.“The speech therapist gave me a sheet with little pictures on it so I could point and ask for a cup of tea.“That really helped me to start speaking again. I have people who call me every day, like my son and my niece, and Sharon calls me every week. I also have carers coming in.“Without these people’s help, I wouldn’t know anything. I had no idea of all the dferent ways stroke can affect people.“At first I couldn’t even say Darlene’s name, but I’ve made so much progress and it’s because of CHSS.“Darlene introduced me to Sharon, the volunteer who calls me every week.

It doesn’t affect someone’s intelligence.“It can be a very frightening and isolating condition and also hugely frustrating.“People tell us aphasia can affect every aspect of their lives, not just everyday activities like talking to your friends and family, using the phone or public transport, but also work, relationships and wellbeing.“Many people have never even heard of aphasia until it affects them or their loved one’s le.“We want to make sure people across Scotland are more aphasia aware.”She added: “By understanding what it is like for people to live with aphasia, we can improve awareness of the condition and help thousands of people living with aphasia feel supported in their communities.” It should have been a safe space for informed debate, somewhere for readers to discuss issues around the biggest stories of the day, but all too often the below the line comments on most websites have become bogged down by off-topic discussions and abuse. heraldscotland is tackling this problem by allowing only subscribers to comment.We are doing this to improve the experience for our loyal readers and we believe it will reduce the ability of trolls and troublemakers, who occasionally find their way onto our site, to abuse our journalists and readers.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for.

Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure.

The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.

She was referring to the the three-year collapse of Stormont, which came about in January  when Sinn Fein said it would not go back into an Executivewith the DUP, unless legislation for an Irish language act was implemented, following the DUP and Ms Foster’s handling of the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: From Arlene vs Naomi and election poster fights to the prettiest street in FoyleArlene Foster says ‘all to play for’ in Assembly election even with Sinn Fein ahead in ‘most of the polls’East Belfast Assembly candidate Ms Long replied: “No, it isn#t true, Arlene. We have consistently called for reform of the institutions to allow an Executive to be formed by those willing to do it. The DUP weren’t up for serious reform in that three years because your vetoes are mutual -Sinn Fein lost theirs, you#d lose yours.”Ms Foster, who is now a contributor to GB News, then claimed that “not once” did Ms Long say the government “should change the Belfast agreement to facilitate those of us who were willing to go into Stormont for three years whilst Sinn Fein kept us all out”.The Alliance leader said that she and her colleagues have reiterated “that *no* single party should be able to collapse the institutions” and that they “said it during the last suspension too”.And maybe you let us see how nasty you really are from time to time. #maskslips. #playtheball #nastyparty #alliance. https:t.co gGDMOUyOk— Arlene Foster #ProudofNI.April , She added that both the DUP and Sinn Fein “had red lines holding us all back” and said: “We raised reform throughout the talks, including voluntary coalitionand ending abuse of the petition of concern.

I would say it is all to play for.“I think what you will see after these elections in any event will be a period of talks. After any election there was always a period of time before the Executive was in place.“I’m afraid we will see a period of talks and it will just be very interesting to see who wins out in the end.”The former politician suggested the Northern Ireland Protocol is likely to dominate the election among unionists and when askedpeople in the province still supported the prospect of devolved government at Stormont, Ms Foster said she thought they did, “on balance”.“I thinkyou had asked me that question a few years ago, I would have said a resounding yes. I think unionists are dissatisfied with the Assembly because of the protocol.“I think in the main people do like to have their own elected ministers taking decisions.

Credit: Claire SugdenNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAssembly candidate Claire Sugden has revealed how she has been working into the wee small hours creating her own election posters, leaflets and social media imagery.Despite having no formal graphics training, the former East Londonderry MLA designs and writes all of her own election material — something she has been doing since she first stood for Stormont six years ago.“It saves me a considerable amount of money and it’s something I enjoy,” explained the independent unionist and former justice minister. “Whenever I was at the age when I was deciding what it was I wanted to do with my le, it was either politics or art. I ended up going down the political route, so it’s kind of nice that when it comes to election times, I can exercise that other side of things.“I have an A-level in art and that’s it. It’s all self-taught. My husband is a computer games artist, so I take a lot of advice from him, but a lot of it is Googling how to do things and, I think, having a bit of an eye for design anyway. None of it is perfect, I’m sure someone who is qualied and experienced in this field would be able to pull up something quicker and a lot more eye-catching, but I’m pleased with the way it turns out.”The Coleraine woman said she spent a few days last week “going round the constituency getting some photographs just to get nice fresh images for the literature”, but overall she’s kept to the same colour scheme and theme for her election content since she first stood in .“It can take a while, but sitting down I can get into a bit of a zone with it. You can find me maybe starting it at pm and still sitting until am in the morning because I’m on a bit of a roll with it. There’s other days when I get a bit of a block and that’s usually the days where you’re under pressure and trying to make deadlines for printers.”She joked: “If the election doesn’t go my way, maybe I have another career!”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClaire SugdenMore On Claire Sugden PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseUkraine crisis: Stormont urged to ‘step up’ and pressure Home Office into waiving visa requirement for refugeesSugden’s anger as Stormont crisis endangers mental health court planStaffing crisis in agri-food industry is down to immigration rules, Poots toldIndependent unionist Claire Sugden ‘less likely’ to join UUP following Doug Beattie tweet stormMost ReadLurgan mum diagnosed with cancer in AE told she only had ‘hours to live’The Dead Rabbit: Belfast owners of famous New York bar end their partnershipArlene Foster accuses Naomi Long and Alliance Party of being ‘nasty’ when ‘mask slips’ in Twitter spatInga Maria Hauser murder: Never-before-published pictures revealed as cops probing savage killing urge those responsible to come forwardStormont department apologises and drops its legal challenge over whistleblowerTop VideosPlayDerry Girls season  premiere: #We#ve shown people another side of Derry#PlayWatch: Dog finally reunited with owner after surviving battlefield in UkrainePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election DUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyArlene Foster says ‘all to play for’ in Assembly election even with Sinn Fein ahead in ‘most of the polls’Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From Arlene vs Naomi and election poster fights to the prettiest street in FoyleAlliance Assembly candidate Connie Egan jokes that vandals of her election posters are ‘terrible’ at artArlene Foster accuses Naomi Long and Alliance Party of being ‘nasty’ when ‘mask slips’ in Twitter spatLatestDwayne Johnson and Samuel L Jackson to present at Kid’s Choice Awards Dizzee Rascal to be sentenced for assaulting ex-fianceeJudge’s ruling due on legal challenge against Holocaust memorial siteDay two of th Masters sees Tiger Woods face his biggest test to dateTom Hiddleston treks across Antarctica on foot in new Apple TV series,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailYou can’t drink your morning coffee without an audience and as you walk down the road you are watched from all angles, both geometrically and politically.That’s right — election season is upon us and as a result, the faces of your local politicians on poster after poster are becoming more familiar than the heartthrobs we had on our walls as teenagers.It is one staple of election campaigns that has been around for decades,not centuries, and while there’s some sport initially in comparing the tenets of graphic design, colour schemes and haircutsof our political representatives, when you sit and think about it, is this something that’s really needed in this day and age As a journalist, I’m probablymore familiar with Northern Ireland’s politicians than the average person, given my job involves thinking, talking and writing about them on a daily basis. As such, I don’t often need a reminder of who there is to vote for in my constituency or what parties they stand for. I’ll admit that an election poster is certainly an easy way to raise awareness of, on a basic level, exactly who represents or wants to represent you.But after seeing the same person staring at me five times before I had crossed a single bridge in Coleraine where I live the other day, I started to wonder do posters influence how people vote — or are posters just a habit, one which may not serve the most purpose but indicates you have a dog in the fight Read MoreIndependent candidate Claire Sugden using her artistic flair for election materialThe ironic thing is that maybe posters mean much more to the smaller parties and independents with comparably smaller budgets to the more prominent frontrunners. For them, it’s more of a stretch to measure up the level of postering and the legwork it takes displayed by other parties but who worry they won’t get as much attentionthey don’t appear to have parity in terms of faces on streets.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Often described as CorriBoard posters, many of those massive signs you see on our streets and roads are made from one of the dirtiest words of our time — plastic. While the materials can sometimes be upcycled, it is suggested they will take hundreds of years to degrade, long after the politicians whose faces on which they featured and possibly even the parties they represented have departed this fine earth.It’s true that they do have benefits. They are immune to hackers which have plagued recent international elections . Not everyone has top class internet access so it does keep demographics informed. There’s no question that they send a message to voters and a reminder that an election is taking place — andyour local MLA hasn’t fixed that pothole on your road, you will know just the face to ask when they come a-canvassing.Green Party NI politician Mal O’Hara has joined some of his international colleagues in favouring a system seen in Europe where paper posters are erected in certain spaces only, instead of being festooned on every available surface. But this approach isn’t favoured by some larger parties who are able to spread their resources more widely and want to be able to show that. And so, without any wider consensus, the great poster parade marches on even in  when the word on all of our lips is the environment and many of us are kept awake at night wondering what sort of a world it is we’re leaving behind for the next generation and the one after that.What is the alternative  Some may argue it’s already here, and it’s called social media, where most views are shared and heard and your popularity isn’t always just down to what party backs you, but how well you use your voice. There’s also mainstream media via the television, news sites and newspapers as well as the radio. And for those who have access to neither, there’s canvassing — and feel free to reject those shiny leaflets which usually take a short trip to the bin in favour of a chat instead.Or why not make use of the screens in Belfast city centre or in shopping centres to instead display candidates posters on a revolving basis, on the proviso that these screens and devices would have to be made more widely available in our towns and villages Some may disregard these suggestions but surely there must be another way, instead of risking damage to the environment and obscuring our beautul landscape on this island with these massive posters cropping up at regular intervals.Whatever your thoughts on posters, the discourse around them doesn’t end after the election unfortunately. And while you might find the face of a local politician peaking out from behind a hedge or unlucky enough to be placed atop a bonfire, you will also be treated to the crowdsourcing operation that is your local politician asking you to make them aware of any forlorn final poster still lingering on our streets. Or at the very least, a photo of them with clippers in hand, telling all they are out and about removing their posters, sent to the rubbish heap, after election season comes to an end.Related topicsGreen PartyMore On Green PartyClimate Change Bill was ‘not everything’ Green Party leader Clare Bailey hoped for PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behind PremiumFionola MeredithOpinionWhy there’s no such thing as giving kids a ‘loving smack’Most ReadLurgan mum diagnosed with cancer in AE told she only had ‘hours to live’The Dead Rabbit: Belfast owners of famous New York bar end their partnershipArlene Foster accuses Naomi Long and Alliance Party of being ‘nasty’ when ‘mask slips’ in Twitter spatInga Maria Hauser murder: Never-before-published pictures revealed as cops probing savage killing urge those responsible to come forwardStormont department apologises and drops its legal challenge over whistleblowerTop VideosPlayDerry Girls season  premiere: #We#ve shown people another side of Derry#PlayWatch: Dog finally reunited with owner after surviving battlefield in UkrainePlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election DUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyArlene Foster says ‘all to play for’ in Assembly election even with Sinn Fein ahead in ‘most of the polls’Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From Arlene vs Naomi and election poster fights to the prettiest street in FoyleAlliance Assembly candidate Connie Egan jokes that vandals of her election posters are ‘terrible’ at artArlene Foster accuses Naomi Long and Alliance Party of being ‘nasty’ when ‘mask slips’ in Twitter spatLatestDwayne Johnson and Samuel L Jackson to present at Kid’s Choice Awards Dizzee Rascal to be sentenced for assaulting ex-fianceeJudge’s ruling due on legal challenge against Holocaust memorial siteDay two of th Masters sees Tiger Woods face his biggest test to dateTom Hiddleston treks across Antarctica on foot in new Apple TV series,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance. All of the  girls used for Down played their bit.Scorers for Down were Annie McEvoy , Clodagh Simpsonand the top scorer was Orla Owens .Best performers for Down v Armagh were Lily Magee in nets, Eloise Austin, Therese Cowan, Ava McArdle, Zara Kelly, Isa McCarron, Aoe Wolfe, Anna McArdle and captain Maia Murdock but it was Orla Owens who took the player of the match award with her five points.With the Platinum All-Ireland series still to be played in the coming weeks, and the way these girls continue to improve week by week, who knows how far they can go.The management and girls would like to thank everyone for all the messages prior to the final and for all the support on the day.Down: L Magee E Austin, F M Morgan, T Cowan A McArdle, M Murdock, Z Kelly A Wolfe, I McCarron A McArdle, H Donnelly, A McEvoy O Owens, C Simpson, E McKee.Subs: D OrsquoShea, E OrsquoKane, H McGeough, R Horisk, E Farrell, C McDermott, C McGrath, G Kelly, G McMullan, E McHugh, A McKay, H Cassin, C Lundy, T Ryan, L Elmore..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  April 8%2C 1992  ","story":"NEWCASTLE mdash The RNLI has unveiled plans for a major new pound, leboat station for Newcastle.The station, which is at the planning permission stage, will house the new Mersey class leboat which is due to arrive at the seaside town towards the end of November.If the station plans get Department of the Environment approval, the new complex will be constructed to the north of the harbour beside Newcastle Yacht Clubrsquos car park.The RNLIrsquos tractor house and the old Coastguard station will be demolished to make way for the building and a  metre-long slipway will be constructed to just beyond the high water mark.The new station will replace the existing boathouse which was built in  and, apart from some superficial work, has never been updated. The leboat crew and the shore team have to wash at a stand-pipe and the only toilets are an old Victoria public lavatory adjacent to the boathouse.In addition to a modern launching facility, which is clear of the problem-bedevilled harbour, the new station will provide the leboatmen with a crew room, equipped with toilets and showers, a kitchen, training room, lookout area and souvenir outlet.Work on the new complex is likely to take up to six months to complete and,planning permission is granted, is expected to start in June.The longest part of the work will be the construction of the slipway

containing a mixture of acid and caustic soda, fell from a lorry on the Old Grand Jury Road at around am on Friday morning, initiating a full-scale emergency response from the Fire Brigade.Appliances from Ballynahinch and Downpatrick were sent to the scene and a specialist equipment carrying emergency tender unit was also despatched from Belfast.The incident occurred as the articulated lorry was leaving a yard on the Old Grand Jury Road carrying a large number of the chemical-containing drums.The four drums fell from the lorry, with two spilling several hundred gallons of the corrosive mixture onto the road.The lorry driver and his two assistants quickly righted the drums but suffered from fume inhalation, as did two police officers who arrived on the scene minutes after the spill.All five were treated at the Downe Hospital but were later released.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash The Department of Environmentrsquos proposals for the management of Strangford Lough have been welcomed as a ldquotriumph of common sense.The comment comes from the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Associationrsquos chairman, Mr Sam Davis, who is urging all lough users to unite in supporting the new administrators.Mr Davisrsquo confidence-boosting commendation of the new body comes a matter of weeks before its inaugural meeting.SLNCA was born out of the conflict felt around the Lough by controversial DoE management proposals put forward a few years ago.The recommendation to support the new administrators on the eve of their activity will be seen as a wholehearted effort by people who are anxious to make the new management structure work.Mr Davis and the Associationrsquos joint council declared after last weekrsquos meeting that the new structure represents what the loughside community have been looking for.ldquoThe new body represents a wide spectrum of community support, including the pockets of power which were driven largely by their own self-interests, he said.MOURNES

figure of pound, for the residential home has been produced without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report.The claims were made by a deputation from the Friends of Mourne House which addressed the councilrsquos monthly meeting in Dundonald on Thursday afternoon.Friends spokesman, Mr Damian Smyth, told the meeting that the renovation figures which were produced by the Down and Lisburn Unit of Management, are completely dferent from early figures produced by the Eastern Health Boardrsquos building control officer.The officerrsquos report said Mourne House was in good repair, was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a pioneering emergency response scheme which will save the lives of heart attack victims.The British Heart Foundation this week handed over a le-saving defibrillator which will enable doctors to provide a first response to cardiac emergencies pending the arrival of an ambulance.The presentation was made on Monday to Portaferry GPs Dr Desmond Compton and Dr David Peacock by Mr Peter Welsh, the Foundationrsquos regional organiser.The doctors believe the equipment could provide a le-saving service for , people in Portaferry and lower Ards Peninsula.It takes around  minutes from an ambulance based in Newtownards to reach the lower Ards.Even so, it would be virtually impossible to put a permanent ambulance in the area because it would be seldom used, according to the Eastern Health Boardrsquos chief ambulance officer, Mr Alan Murray.The Ambulance Service has funded the inclusion of sophisticated diagnostic facilities on the defibrillator, as well as communication systems for the doctors to ensure their immediate availability.BALLYNAHINCH mdash One of Down Districtrsquos biggest charity events of the year will take place in Ballynahinch next month.The Ballynahinch Lions k and

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends.

In that context, I do not consider there to be any need for this proposal.A spokesperson for Arc said there was still a ldquoclear need to develop a ldquonew, modern waste infrastructure for the region.It said the proposed facility would boost recycling, reduce emissions and provide green electricity.ldquoIt is essential that Arc has an opportunity to review the planning reasons behind the ministerrsquos statement and we will carefully consider todayrsquos announcement in that light over the next few days, added the spokesperson..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Museum to shut doors over Easter  ","story":"THE Down County Museum in Downpatrick will be closed over Easter.The announcement came just hours after Newry, Mourne and Down Council refused to confirmthe museum would be open to the public over the busy Easter holiday period.Initially, the local authority would only confirm that a decision on the Easter opening would be made in ldquodue course, but within hours of informing the Recorder of this and the paper being printed, it was finally revealed that the museum would remain closed.The council has subsequently confirmed that a reduced staff team is delivering services at the museum mdash which only opens between am and pm from Wednesday and Friday mdash and it is ldquowith regret that it will not be open at Easter.The Recorder understands that are six vacant staff positions at the museum and that up to five staff members are currently off sick.Adverts to recruit new museum staff have been published this week with the local authority looking to appoint and assistant curator, education and outreach officer, museum assistant and a cultural assistant.While council officials are hoping to have new employees in place next month, the local authority has not made clear how many new staff are being recruited and what the Downpatrick museumrsquos future opening hours will be.The museum has been at the centre of a controversial staff restructuring process.Downpatrick SDLP councillor Dermot Curran said thee council should have made it clear last week that the museum would be closed at Easter.Welcoming plans to recruit new employees, he suggested that councillors should be briefed at a one-off council meeting by senior local authority officials on exactly what is happening at the museum.ldquoI remain disappointed that the museum will not be open at Easter. While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month. I look forward to seeing the results of this so that we can begin to make changes. Council urgently needs to resolve these staffing pressures, reflect on how the downgrading of the museum has contributed to them and seek the urgent reopening of the Down Museum.He added: ldquoI am disappointed that the Down Museum has become another example of how services are being moved from Downpatrick to Newry. I see all the potential Downpatrick has to be a thriving city, but time and again our services are being redirected to Newry.ldquoI want to see Downpatrick on the map as a destination town for the whole of Northern Ireland, andelected to the Assembly in May, I will fight to bring an end to the lack of delivery for Downpatrick that we have seen from the political establishment in the area for so long.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the organisation is currently operating with a reduced team of staff to deliver the services at the Downpatrick museum.He said: ldquoIt is therefore with regret that the museum opening times over the Easter holiday period will be Wednesday to Friday between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Portaferry man Peter hoping to lose 50lbs in 50 weeks during fundraiser for Air Ambulance NI  ","story":"PORTAFERRY man Peter McGrattan set himself a target of raising vital funds to Air Ambulance NI by losing lbs in  weeks before his th birthday.He started last October and has already lost  pounds, with just  pounds to go before his birthday on September .Peter is a driver for Coach Connections and coaches the Down U- hurling team in his spare time.He explained why he wanted to get involved in such a public way of losing weight.lsquoMy father Kevin was involved in a road traffic collision in Portaferry in , sustaining a traumatic head injury, said Peter.ldquoThankfully Air Ambulance NI were there on the day to treat him and swtly transferred him to Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up.

Such a daft response helped to embolden President Vladimir PutinBoris Johnson’s government therefore is right to include non carbon producing nuclear energy as part of the UK’s vision. Such a move was all the more essential after Ukraine showed the danger of being over reliant on other nations for energy needs.Yet nuclear remains off the table in Ireland, north or south.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrom ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.Salted caramel Easter eggsThere is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. .removeSome of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.The verdict: Which Aldi chocolate Easter eggs are worth buying From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website hereThe Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/20048484.aldi-lidl-middle-aisles-thursday/res","title":"aldi lidl middle aisles thursday","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather.

The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.

These will be taken in conjunction with GMB who also represents bus workers at Translink. The strike action planned will be a week, starting April  and concluding on May , as well as a single day on Friday, May . The strike comes after members of the union overwhelmingly voted for industrial action after rejecting the latest Translink management pay offer. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham expressed her support for the striking bus workers. She said, “These bus workers are frontline workers – they deserve respect and a pay increase. Translink needs to grasp that there’s a cost of living crisis destroying the value of wages andwith a more acceptable offer. “Unite’s members have my full support and that of their union in taking this strike action for fairer pay.” Unite deputy Regional Secretary Davy Thompson is lead officer for Translink, Northern Ireland’s bus and rail public transport provider. He added:“Unite represents the overwhelming majority of bus workers, and this strike action taken in conjunction with GMB which also represents bus workers will shut down all bus services. “Bus workers deserve a pay increase. The ball is in the court of Translink management. They can to avoid this unnecessary and highly disruptive strike – they need to address our members’ legitimate pay expectations.” Meanwhile, Peter Macklin, GMB Organiser, said:Every worker deserves fair pay. With rampant inflation, this real terms cut is a slap in the face and will leave many struggling to cover their bills. “Translinkfails to recognise what workers went through during the pandemic. “They kept transport running so other essential workers could get to and from workplaces to perform vital roles. “Our members were proud to carry out their duty in delivering the service, potentially putting themselves and their families at risk. When we clapped every Thursday night, we said the essential workers would not be forgotten or left behind. But during this cost of living crisis, Translink is forgetting their own workers. “The dispute, which affects bus drivers, cleaners and shunters will close the entire bus network within Northern Ireland. It will be a complete shutdown.” A Translink spokesperson said they were disappointed that the unions hadvoted to take industrial action. “Following extensive negotiations, including with the Labour Relations Agency, we made a pay offer of % plus an enhanced package of conditions that included a % increase in weekend and overtime rates along with  extra days holiday, they said. “We believe this was a fair and reasonable offer and have at all times been open to discussions. We remain committed to working with the unions to avert this action. “We would welcome the opportunity to engage with unions to cover school duties, so that the wellbeing of schoolchildren can remain a priority. “All train services will continue to operate as normal. “We will communicate relevant passenger information through the media, on our website www.translink, through social media, in stations and on buses and trains. “Translink apologises for any inconvenience this may cause”.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fefccbabfeedaca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcddcbbffca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
