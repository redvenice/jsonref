As far as I am concerned, to do so would be both dishonest and irresponsible.\u0027Dr Mackereth, whose world view is \u0027unashamedly\u0027 Christian, had worked in the NHS for 26 years when he was dismissed, including seven at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford.He had replied to an advert for the DWP job in May 2018 and was interviewed by recruitment firm manager James Owen.         The doctor also worked at The Princess Royal Hospital in Telford for the past seven years and had a 26-year career within the NHS in totalHaving obtained the post, the experienced emergency department doctor was sent on a two-week training course in Marylebone, London.The medic said that documents he was provided with before the course did not indicate he may be required to use pronouns \u0027in accordance with arbitrary choices rather than in accordance with English grammar and common sense\u0027.Giving his account of a meeting with Mr Owen on June 13 2018 at the Birmingham assessment centre, Dr Mackereth said: \u0027I was engaged in working on my second real case when Mr Owen called me out of my work. \u0027The purpose was to interrogate me about my beliefs in relation to the use of pronouns.\u0027To the best of my recollection, in fact there was no mention of the word transgender during our meeting. We talked about the DWP\u0027s more general policy of using whatever pronoun the client wants.\u0027That discussion culminated in Mr Owen asking me the following question - Let\u0027s just summarise this. If you have a man six feet tall with a beard, who says he wants to be addressed as \u0027she\u0027 and \u0027Mrs\u0027 - would you do that?\u0027I am quite sure this is exactly what he said to me, in substance if not verbatim. I told him that, as a Christian, I would not be able to accede to such a request in good conscience.\u0027Dr Mackereth claims Mr Owen then made it clear that unless he agreed to use such pronouns he was overwhelmingly likely to lose his job, although the final decision was for the DWP.\u0027The issue of pronouns first arose towards the end of the second week of my training on or around June 7, 2018, during one of the session with Dr Omar Ahmed, the lead physician for the course,\u0027 he said.\u0027One of the assessors, a doctor, asked Dr Ahmed what pronouns should be used to refer to clients in the reports.\u0027She probably had the ideological issues of transgenderism andor gender fluidity in mind, but those terms themselves were not mentioned.\u0027Dr Ahmed responded: We write reports using whatever pronouns the client requires. He did not mention the word transgender.\u0027 The doctor claims no effort was made to accommodate his beliefs, such as referring transgender clients to another assessor.At the conclusion of his opening statement to the tribunal panel, Dr Mackereth said: \u0027What I object to is being forced to do violence to language and common sense, in a ritual denial of an obvious truth, for the sake of an ideology which I disbelieve and detest.\u0027The very fact a doctor can be pulled off the shop floor for an urgent interrogation about his beliefs on gender fluidity is both absurd and very sinister.\u0027Addressing the panel today, he compared his \u0027politically correct\u0027 bosses to the former totalitarian Islamist rulers of Afghanistan, the Taliban.He told the panel: \u0027I unashamedly take a Christian world view. To be a servant to all does not mean to be a slave to all this does not mean I should do anything the politically correct government wants.\u0027It is the idea that truth is relative, which opens to door to and smooths the way for the \u0027gender fluidity\u0027 movement.\u0027You believe that you are a different gender from that \u0027assigned at birth\u0027, and that is true for you, so it is true in a relative sense. I cannot accept this approach to the nature of truth.\u0027He added: \u0027Any attempt to pretence to change one\u0027s sex or gender means a refusal to accept that God has created us \u0027male and female\u0027 and that God\u0027s creation was perfect.\u0027As such, this is a rebellion against God, which is both pointless and sinful. Therefore, human desires should not be condoned or followed uncritically.\u0027The law of God in the Old Testament forbids cross-dressing: The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman\u0027s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.\u0027The DWP denies Dr Mackereth\u0027s beliefs are \u0027protected\u0027 under the Equality Act, while a recruitment agency which appointed him to his post argues his views conflict with the fundamental rights of others.It argues that what the doctor was proposing to do was \u0027unwanted conduct\u0027 towards those undergoing gender reassignment, and could have constituted harassment under equality law.In his evidence from the witness box, the doctor was asked if refusing to use claimants\u0027 preferred titles would undermine their dignity.\u0027I believe that we are made in God\u0027s image - male and female,\u0027 he told the three-member tribunal panel. \u0027I do not believe that it would undermine somebody\u0027s dignity.\u0027Explaining his views, Dr Mackereth added: \u0027I don\u0027t believe a person can change their gender. It\u0027s not scientifically or medically possible. We have a problem here of two world views that struggle to accept each other.\u0027Robert Moretto, representing the DWP, asked Dr Mackereth about the General Medical Council code of conduct, which states you must be \u0027polite and considerate\u0027 to those being assessed, and not express personal beliefs to patients which may cause distress.Dr Mackereth said of the regulations: \u0027It doesn\u0027t stop me from saying: I am sorry, I am Christian, there are some things I can\u0027t do.\u0027I can\u0027t be forced to do something that goes against my conscience. What I am saying about pronouns is not going to affect the quality of the assessment that I do. I don\u0027t object to doing assessments on transgender people.\u0027Mr Moretto put it to the doctor that refusing to address people under their presenting sex would amount to harassment under equality laws by having the effect of violating their dignity.Dr Mackereth answered \u0027I don\u0027t agree\u0027, adding: \u0027We do love transgender people. That\u0027s our duty as Christians. But to love people doesn\u0027t mean we can accept every ideology that comes our way.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"British academic reveals moment realised getting dementia like father","story":"Share this article Mr Pandolfo, who is unmarried and has no children, lives in Lancaster and lectured in education at the town\u0027s university after winning a scholarship to Oxford.He now struggles to read and write coherently, keep track of time or hold conversations, and is unable to drive.Following his diagnosis, Mr Pandolfo claims he made the decision pretty much straight away to plan ending his own life abroad. He said: \u0027It\u0027s something I\u0027ve believed in and supported for a long time.

Coach Justin Langer hopes the methods work against arch-enemy England on Thursday‘People tend to turn to what I loosely term “magical thinking” in situations where there is uncertainty or a loss of control — and sporting matches are prime examples of that, where it doesn’t matter how skilled you are, something may not go your way,’ he says.‘On a rational level most of us know these things are nonsense but they give an illusion of control — and as most rituals come under the heading of “even if it doesn’t work it hasn’t cost you anything”, then mostly people have nothing to lose by employing them.’Langer’s unusual coaching rituals join a rich history of sporting superstitions, as we reveal here...RAFA’S ROUTINESWhile Roger Federer famously eschews superstition, his great on-court rival Rafael Nadal cleaves to a series of small, repetitive rituals before and during every game. Clutching a single racket as he walks on to court, he removes his jacket while facing the crowd. He then carefully lines up two bottles of Evian — one chilled, one room temperature — alongside one another, ensuring the labels face the court. No one is allowed to touch them.Whenever he is serving, Nadal will touch his buttock, then his left shoulder, right shoulder, nose, left ear, nose again and right ear. When heading for his chair between games, he will step over the line using his right foot first and only after he has received two sweat towels.         Wayne Rooney’s unchanging pre-game routine involves eating a bowl of Coco Pops before matchesBy contrast Serena Williams is less high-maintenance: she will wear the same socks from the first round of a Grand Slam tournament — it’s unknown whether or not she washes them in between — to the final. And she always bounces the ball five times before her first serve (and just twice before the second).Perhaps the most famously wacky behaviour, however, belongs to Croatia’s Goran Ivanisevic who, on the way to his unexpected 2001 triumph in the men’s singles at Wimbledon, followed an unchanging and quite bizarre daily timetable.He began each day by watching Teletubbies and ended it at the same table of a restaurant in SW19, eating fish soup, lamb with chips, and ice cream with chocolate sauce.KISSES \u0026amp COCO POPSThere is no shortage of odd little rituals unfolding in the dressing rooms of our football teams before a match. At Everton, club captain Leighton Baines always ties, unties and then re-ties his boot laces in the dressing room before heading out on to the pitch.Former Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who’s now at Monaco, kisses a ring given to him by his wife four times — his lucky number — then leaves it in his locker, while Barcelona and ex-Liverpool striker Luis Suarez also has a kiss-based ritual before any match: for him it’s a tattoo on his wrist bearing the names of his children.         Whenever he is serving, Rafa Nadal will touch his buttock, then his left shoulder, right shoulder, nose, left ear, nose again and right earWayne Rooney’s unchanging pre-game routine involves eating a bowl of Coco Pops before matches, emulating his Manchester United predecessor George Best, who would consume a whole chocolate bar.Rooney also practises creative visualisation — the act of creating and ‘rehearsing’ a positive mental experience in order to enhance your ability to achieve a successful outcome in real life.He has said that he often lies in bed the night before a game visualising himself scoring goals.Back in his playing prime, England star Gary Lineker never kicked a ball towards the goal while warming up, believing that if he scored he was ‘wasting’ one of his goals in the match.Former Chelsea captain John Terry had no end of pre-game rituals, from sitting in the same seat on the team coach, and listening to the same music — by American musician Usher — on the way to the ground.He also used to tape his socks exactly three times prior to a game.TEE WHEEZELucky balls, lucky clubs —golfers, whether pros or weekend hitters, are renowned for embracing myriad superstitions.It might involve never using a red tee or never washing a ball with which you’ve played well. One of the greatest of all players, Jack Nicklaus, would only play when he had three coins in his pocket. The denomination didn’t matter, it just had to be three.For others the behaviours are colour based: Lee Trevino was once quoted as saying that he would never use yellow tees because it is the colour of cowardice, while Tiger Woods almost always wears a red shirt for the final round of a tournament — a superstition that comes from his Thai mother, who believes the colour represents power.Female golfer Paula Creamer’s final-round dress code is always pink, a habit that has earned her the nickname ‘Pink Panther.’LUCKY PANTSIn his playing days, rugby star Jonny Wilkinson — another avid fan of creative visualisation — always wore the same T-shirt under his England shirt, claiming that it was a form of routine that helped to keep his nerves at bay.South Africa’s former captain John Smit wore exclusively black underwear on match days, in the belief that any other colour would bring him bad luck.Former Scottish international Simon Taylor had a novel way of revving himself up before a game, doing what he called the ‘Bruce Lee kung-fu wavy hands’ in the dressing room beforehand.WHEELY WACKYThose competing on two wheels have no shortage of quirks: the former American road cyclist Evelyn Stevens took a lucky marble with her on all of her professional races, while Britain’s Olympic star Laura Kenny makes sure to step on a wet towel before she clambers on her bike.Road-race sprinter Mark Cavendish, meanwhile, refuses to bathe before an important competition, while mountain-bike racer Rachel Atherton will never put on her right shoe before her left one. "},{"url":null,"title":"Chinese overtake Northern Irish applications UK university places","story":"Share this article The Ucas figures for overseas applicants found the next biggest cohort was from India, with 6,210 – up 5 per cent on this time last year.Within the EU, the biggest number of applications came from France, at 5,330.

Emerging from the tube station, you are confronted with a cacophony of competing structures: the tilting concrete struts supporting a glass canopy swerve drunkenly towards a wall of fat towers clad in a chequerboard of bronze, champagne and metallic dog-turd brown.To the right looms a bulbous sales-suite-cum-gallery, to the left the jazzy shed of Ravensbourne College, while all around lie assorted oddments of public art and curated happenings, from a huge, twisted steel spire to a surreal dinner party in the sky – a table suspended from a crane where you can eat dinner, strapped to a seat, for £200. Completing the panorama of pointless whimsy, the pylons of Boris Johnson’s costly cable car stretch across the Thames in the distance.This souped-up graveyard of novelty trinkets is a fitting place to find London’s answer to the High Line, New York’s verdant park, built on a former train track. Billed as “a layered network of recreation, culture and wellness” by Knight Dragon, the neighbourhood’s Hong Kong-based developer, the raised footpath will weave its way around the district in a 5km loop “stitching together erse ecosystems”.There have been many cynical attempts to emulate the High Line since it was found that proximity to an elevated green space can significantly raise property prices, but The Tide, a new walkway on the peninsula, is perhaps the most brazen of them all. While the Manhattan footpath transformed an abandoned route in 2009, with the unintended consequence of accelerating local gentrification, London’s version has seen the construction of an elaborate steel structure specifically to elevate the value of a steroidal development of luxury apartments. It is the marketeers’ flimsy sugarcoating of “placemaking” in its most unashamed form, a textbook combination of greenwashing and artwashing, as a decoy to distract from the low levels of affordable housing. But perhaps the most surprising thing is that the architects of the original High Line are behind it.“We were a bit sceptical about getting involved at first,” says Ben Gilmartin, partner at Diller Scofidio + Renfro. “We were originally approached to do an apartment tower, but we weren’t in the business of designing commercial towers, so we proposed a public space masterplan instead.”There was already a plan for a 5km running track around the site, but they brought a seductive sprinkle of DS+R fairy dust. Gilmartin describes their concept as akin to a “charm bracelet”, a multilayered route that would link together the cultural flotsam already scattered around the site, from Antony Gormley’s Quantum Cloud sculpture to Richard Wilson’s sliced-open ship. “The idea was that anything that came along could plug in,” he says. “We imagined it plugging into Ravensbourne, shooting up over the highway and plunging straight through the new shopping mall, as well as having an arm flying off into the new film studios.”It was a similar concept to the City of London’s postwar Pedway plan, except that, rather than each piece being built incrementally by a sequence of developers, this would all be built by the benevolent Knight Dragon – a company with a track record of changing its plans. The film studio idea has since been axed and the grand £1bn centrepiece by Santiago Calatrava – intended to be a combination of tube and bus station, with bars, shops and entertainment venues, as well as offices, hotels and apartments – is already being rethought.The first kilometre-long section of The Tide has just been unveiled and, so far, it doesn’t quite live up to its claims of being a useful connective route. It begins at the unholy nexus of Terry Farrell’s gaudily wrapped offices for Transport for London and the swirling eyeful of Ravensbourne College, the overwrought death rattle of Foreign Office Architects, completed shortly before they split up in 2010 and looking like a giant Connect 4 game dressed in dazzle camouflage. In between these two hulks stands The Tide’s first cluster of steel “trees”, rising at jaunty angles to support the pedestrian deck above, with real trees sprouting from their splayed tops.“It’s basically trees with trees on top,” says Gilmartin, explaining how the steel trunks contain the drainage, power and irrigation, while a combination of birch and pine poke through the decking above. Bearing the trademark DS+R digital streamlining, they look like platforms from a computer game, bio-sci-fi stalks with more than a touch of Thomas Heatherwick styling – recalling the fungal supports of his ill-fated Garden Bridge, or the curvaceous concrete platforms of his Pier 55 park in New York, currently under construction in the Hudson River, despite a legal battle to stop it.There are 28 steel stalks in all, manufactured by a boat-builder in Italy and shipped here up the river. They support a 250-metre long section of elevated walkway that weaves between a dense obstacle course of vents from the tube station below, terminating in a platform overlooking the Thames. Some of the vent shafts have been wrapped in colourful harlequin costumes by Morag Myerscough, while the biggest is encased in a building of its own, the Prism, designed by Neiheiser Argyros (who also co-designed The Tide) as a faceted mesh box containing a cafe, public loos and a big digital media screen, adding to the landscape of tortured geometries.When you’re standing on the elevated deck, looking out over a jumbled vista of vents and service hatches, it’s difficult to work out quite how anyone thought this was a good idea. It has no purpose whatsoever, apart from providing a slightly different perspective on the surrounding carnage. A flight of raked steps suggests an area where performances might take place, while another section swoops down to form a protective bowl around a cafe terrace, but the point of being raised five-to-nine metres above the ground – over an area that is already pedestrianised – remains a mystery. After the short jaunt, you descend back to ground to join the remainder of the 1km route, which is simply the pre-existing Thames Path, repaved and adorned with some new benches and canopies.Along the way are a number of seats fitted with “audio meditation portals”. Perhaps visitors might dwell here awhile, gaze out towards Damien Hirst’s enormous bronze sea sculptures and Yoko Ono’s forlorn Wish Trees, and meditate on how Knight Dragon acquired the land in 2012 at a knockdown price, after £225m of public money had been spent clearing the site, and soon set about reducing the agreed requirement for affordable housing on the basis of “financial viability”, despite receiving a £50m housing grant. Yet still they somehow managed to find a sizeable wodge of cash to build this superfluous viewing platform, a redundant green garnish to join the peninsula’s infrastructural vanity projects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d661c44002726b65d75473aea3910fc44d156b50/707_1827_3969_2381/master/3969.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c4bc2c2f850ff6a6b3bafe39007bc00","title":"what we re told not to talk about nimko ali review","story":"Women from around the world talk openly about sex, periods and childbirth in a rich, varied studyIn a 20th anniversary edition of The Vagina Monologues, Eve Ensler reflected on how seldom the “v-word” was said aloud in 1996, when she staged her groundbreaking show. The play, based on more than 200 accounts, dramatised women speaking about – and sometimes to – their vaginas, and such was Ensler’s fear of backlash that she thought she might get shot.The lexical evasion that Ensler spoke of, arising out of centuries of cultural shame, fear and secrecy, still takes place. The original title of Nimko Ali’s book was the bolder Rude: There Is No Such Thing as Oversharing (the proof copy had a strikingly suggestive cover design). But Ali was apparently worried that this might suggest the book’s contents were shocking or indecent. The book’s packaging now makes almost no mention of vaginas (there is just one reference at the back of the dust-jacket in a quote from another author).It is, in fact, a rich collection of intimate and uncensored stories. Ali’s book follows in the footsteps of Lynn Enright’s impressive Vagina: A Re-education, published in March, which combines Enright’s own experiences with a range of statistical research, historical background and expert opinion on everything from the hymen and clitoris to periods, pregnancy and labiaplasty. To add to the momentum, Bella Heesom’s play Rejoicing at Her Wondrous Vulva the Young Woman Applauded Herself brought comic dialogue about female genitalia to the London stage in May and is now set to be adapted for television by the production company behind Killing Eve.Ali is a Somali activist who has campaigned against FGM she was awarded an OBE for this work in June. More recently, she drew attention by speaking of Boris Johnson as a “real champion of women’s rights”. For that reason, she said, “he is one of my feminist heroes”.Like Ensler’s play, her book is comprised of many women’s voices these are 42 accounts from 14 countries. The testimonies speak of periods, orgasms and menopause. The women are young and old, Christian and Muslim, some battered by poverty and others buoyed by the wealth of the developed world. We hear them in their own words, without sentences being smoothed over or smartened up by Ali, and this unrefined directness means that while the prose lacks the poetry and formal artfulness of Ensler’s play, it has a visceral drama.Ali delivers the physicality of the women’s experiences with all the leaking, faecal, bloody mess of the body laid bare: the changing texture and colour of periods (brown at the start for many women) the vomiting fits brought on by hyperemesis (a condition the Duchess of Cambridge has had in pregnancy). There is much more gore and discharge as women take us intimately through the first time they had sex or the vaginal splitting and ripping in childbirth, and it all reminds us how silenced this pain normally remains – often unspoken beyond whispering, all-female circles and little documented in literature.A woman named Faz gives birth in a refugee camp. Zay, an 11-year-old Syrian refugee, starts her period while making the voyage to safety and speaks of the lack of sanitary products (“The boat was the scariest thing until the day I woke up covered in blood”). There are those who live with the legacy of FGM and those who are married in exchange for chattels (40 cows and homemade beer in one instance).But it is not always the stories from faraway places that shock the most: Becky, a homeless woman in London, tells a dismaying story of having periods on the street and going into the local Burger King to staunch the blood with tissues. She has learned how to make sanitary pads out of cardboard, plastic bags and paper.Ali includes the sex talk between Somali women she grew up around, and cites Qur’anic instruction for husbands to please their wives in bed. Many Muslims speak of their love of sex, their dominant role in bed, and seeking orce when their husbands can no longer fulfil their sexual needs (“I wanted to exercise that God-given right”). Such welcome accounts sit alongside more familiar stories of control and coercion.Ali’s own voice is uplifting, even if the corny puns – “fannying around” and “deep es” – wear thin. But while the narratives build a powerful chorus of lived experience, deeper reflection is lacking. And while they are culturally erse, all her speakers appear to be heterosexual, cis women. They talk candidly of pleasure or lack of it in heterosexual sex, but no lesbian experience is documented. And there are only passing references to women who feel no tug towards motherhood.The data she collects, by her own admission and apology, is focused largely on the west and her book does not have the emotional punch of Ali’s but it has its own moving moments, and is knowledgeable and discursive, citing Simone de Beauvoir, Lena Dunham, Hilary Mantel (the latter two on living with endometriosis). It is in some ways an ideal accompaniment to Ali’s distillation of personal experience. Together, they paint a vivid picture of contemporary female embodiment.Enright tells us, in one of her many illuminating facts, that a 2015 UK study found two-thirds of women were still “embarrassed about saying the word ‘vagina’”. Full demystification is far off. Yet a new truthfulness is surely emerging around the female body, post #MeToo, and there are signs of creeping progress.• What We’re Told Not to Talk About (But We’re Going to Anyway): Women’s Voices from East London to Ethiopia is published by Viking (£14.99).

One of them was Tara June Winch, who was then – in the words of Bolt – “just 26 and has written only one book, Swallow the Air”. He complained that she had been named an ambassador for the Australia Council’s Indigenous literacy project – which didn’t exist. “Yes, indeed,” Bolt wrote, “because despite her auburn hair and charmingly freckled face, she, too, is an Aborigine, who claims her ‘country is Wiradjuri’.”You may think there is something unjust in starting with this episode, or with Bolt, to tell you about Tara June Winch. But it is integral to understanding her, her latest book The Yield, and the gaps in her story, which you can fill by reading her fiction but you won’t find answers for here. During our interview, she asks me, again and again, to not include particular details of her life. Some are incredibly personal but some are so seemingly innocuous that I begin to wonder if I will have anything left by the end.But ask yourself: how would you have coped with being humiliated before your entire nation, when you were actually 25? How would you deal with a lengthy court battle that would reach Australia’s federal court, that would end with your accuser found guilty of contravening the Racial Discrimination Act but who stood defiant on the court steps, refusing to apologise? You might begin to wonder where all your vulnerabilities start and end. You might begin to resist the idea that, because you are in the public eye, you have to share all of yourself with an audience who want to know about the artist but not the art.We meet in Paris, a long way from Wollongong, where Winch was raised she lives on a rural property near Nantes with her husband, Arnaud, and teenage daughter, Lila. Now 36, she is incredibly nervous about reception to The Yield, her first novel since her 2006 debut, which was beloved by critics, put on school syllabuses and won awards. But what Winch remembers is reading the first review in the Australian, which implied she had only written it with “white editorial help”.“I rang my editor and threatened to jump off the roof,” she says. “It really crushed me. I was really vulnerable. I was 23, a single mum. But then everything else was positive.“I’ve never written anything so commercial, so I am nervous. It means more people loving it or hating it. I should be used to it now, to know it is not an attack on me, but it is really hard, especially when you rip your heart out and put it on the page.”Spending a decade out of the public eye has allowed her to “grow up”, she says. “I was a little kid. I feel old now. I didn’t have my 20s. And if I don’t make it by the time I’m 40, I’ll go be something else.” She doesn’t feel as though she’s made it already? “Nooo,” she says. “If you look at my bank balance, you’ll know I haven’t made it.” But she’s happy? “Yeah. I love writing. It fucks me though. I put on 35 kilos writing this book. Thirty-five. Once the idea was there, it was this huge burst over one year, getting it all on the page. I had to be manic. I had to not sleep. In that state, I didn’t look after my body or my health. It was only my family and my book, and I disappeared.”She apologises for “being selfish” and talking about herself so much – in an interview about her own book. But she’s adamant: “This book can’t just be for me. Maybe that’s why I feel uncomfortable about the attention. It’s not for my ego. This is just my heart on a plate. And I want to get it right.”Massacre Plains is a town ided, in “epithets … procured off supermarket shelves”: Chocolate Chips are the “old Mission Gondiwindi north of town” Vegemite Valley “was where the blackfellas in government housing lived” and the middle-class, mostly white centre, is dubbed “the Minties”. August gets wind that Albert was researching the Indigenous history of the area, new information that may influence a proposed mining project: “The residents of Massacre gossiped about the mine and how bad it would be for the environment and others bit back that they needed jobs. Though all sides of arguing agreed they were owed something more.”In 2008 Winch won a prestigious Rolex mentoring scheme, in which she was paired with the Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, who introduced her to a whole new world of reading for the first time, she began making links between Greek tragedies, biblical myth and Indigenous dreaming stories. There is footage of them strolling together in Nigeria Soyinka looks stately, while Winch is soft-spoken and painfully young. (When asked about her win, she told press that she was “stoked”.) Soyinka seemed to have a good measure of his charge: her next novel, he predicted, “maybe it’ll come in 10 years’ time.” After the Carnage, a confident collection of short stories, came in 2016 but made less of an impact she says it sold only in the hundreds.Winch alternates between guarded and guileless giving details of her life since she left Australia. When I press her to say more about herself, she says: “What I really want to say is on the page. If people really want to know my small, insignificant opinion on anything … you know what I mean? I don’t want to talk about this because I want to be a good role model. I am a flawed human being. I am a tortured person.”She talks of writing as though it is a fight with her own mind, forcing herself to stay awake until the early hours to get herself into a new headspace. “You know that moment at 3am, when you’re honest with yourself? And you are almost like a guide for yourself, leading yourself on the right path? I just want to listen to that voice and get on the right path. But I’m not there yet.”Thomas Keneally has apologised for writing in the voice of an Indigenous character in his 1972 novel The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith – yet he has just done it again in his latest book, The Book of Science and Antiquities. Winch says she is tired of big Australian authors “ticking that box, putting in an Indigenous character because it is Australian novel. Richard Flanagan is a good bloke, but some of the big names, I’m sick of them writing books about Indigenous Australia then talking about how they knew nothing about it. We’ve got a problem when writers in their 60s and 70s don’t know the true history of Australia.”Winch was born a decade after Australia formally ended the policies that created the stolen generations but she is the product of that history she says her fair skin is not uncommon among the Wiradjuri people owing to those policies, and she has seen firsthand how trauma travels down generations. “I’m trying to write that pain in my family whole, which is in a lot of Indigenous families … ” she says, then trails off. “I’m not going to ignore that drugs and alcohol are escapes for pain. And there is a lot of pain in my family.” She doesn’t want to talk about it, but is resigned to journalists asking. “I know you have to ask. And I don’t deny that I have profited from white privilege because of my skin tone. I’m not delusional, I know I look like my mum and not my father. I get it. I don’t have a problem.” The unspoken end to that is: other people do.Which brings us back to Bolt. Winch dropped out of the legal action against him as she was interning in New York: “I was so sad. I was too far away. And it was too much for me. I was too young. I just had to take a step back.” On one level she “almost empathises” with him, as she knows race is complex but “all he had to do was ring my dad, or the local Aboriginal health centre where I went as a kid. It’s fine, it’s OK. But he shouldn’t have said it. If he did a bit more research, he wouldn’t have written that article.”A third of The Yield is Albert’s Wiradjuri dictionary, a selection of the words that have shaped his people’s history – everything from dhalbu (sap of trees) to nadhadirrambanhi (war). Winch didn’t grow up speaking Wiradjuri, but has learned it with the help of elders like Dr Stan Grant Sr,  who was once jailed for speaking his language. “I don’t care about reviews, if he’s happy with it, that’s it,” she says. “And he wants to use The Yield as a teaching tool, so as long as he is happy and my family is happy, that’s it.”She is donating a percentage of royalties to fund Indigenous language classes, which she considers key to renewing pride among those communities. “Imagine a kid growing up learning an Indigenous language, having a sense of identity and pride from it,” she says. “I can see that for Australia.”In Australia, she can also see “a new maturity”, where books like Bruce Pascoe’s Dark Emu and Melissa Lucashenko’s Too Much Lip – shortlisted for the Miles Franklin literary prize – are selling well to white readers: “Australians want to know the truth of their history. There is a renaissance of truth telling in Australia right now.” But that responsibility may now lie somewhere else, for Winch feels finished after The Yield. She dreams of a “really fun, silly book” and becomes most animated describing her next novel, titled Hotel Vague: commercial science fiction set in a Dignitas-style clinic where mothers who have lost children can have their memories erased. That really doesn’t sound silly, I say. She laughs. “I try to write commercial literary fiction and I make it heavy. One day I’ll write something really fun.”For now, she is back, nervous to be in the public eye but determined to see it through, vulnerable yet strong. “I don’t have to be scared any more,” she says. “My daughter doesn’t need me as much, and I’ve got all these stories. There’s no way there will be 10 years between books again. This is my time to be prolific.”• The Yield is published by Penguin Random House Australia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/751308737baf636100fe8fb2e8e66796383b77b9/0_171_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3f464a34066748f81f8192a94d0b715","title":"uk firms accused hiring female directors for symbolic value","story":"Many FTSE 100 companies are failing to advance women’s boardroom careers, report saysSome of Britain’s biggest companies appear to be recruiting female directors for their symbolic value and then failing to advance their boardroom careers, a report has claimed.The average tenure for female executive directors on FTSE 100 boards is 3.3 years, whereas the average for male directors is 6.6. Among non-executives the average woman has served 3.8 years compared with five years for men.The report said the figures were worrying and raised questions about whether women were choosing to leave earlier than men or being pushed off boards. Companies may also be overlooking older women for non-executive roles, it said.Sue Vinnicombe, Cranfield’s professor of women and leadership, said: “There has clearly been great progress on the numbers front but scratch beneath the surface and we suggest that some companies have simply been ticking a box.“There is mounting evidence that women have shorter tenures and are less likely to be promoted into senior roles than their male counterparts.” She called for urgent action to make sure women are appointed on merit and recognised for their contribution. The government has been pushing boards to recruit more women and members of ethnic minorities to broaden the range of views at the top of Britain’s leading businesses. Several studies have shown that companies with erse boards are more successful.Doyin Atewologun, the report’s co-author, said: “Although it is positive to see more women on boards, we need to be sure that we are not only advancing progress for a certain group of women.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37c9decfa353f69dbc8bfb25f7e08159c4521ab/156_0_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88d4cba6d33f2cfe3410a37a315e575c","title":"do you live in a city planned from scratch share your experiences","story":"New cities are being built around the world at an unprecedented pace.

Their boom shows no sign of stoppingby Rachel Keeton and Michelle ProvoostThis pattern of human occupation had characterised the country for thousands of years, but in the 1970s, as ever more precious green land was eaten up by urban growth, an idea that had been taking shape in the national consciousness for decades was finally put into policy. Egypt would “conquer the desert” and redistribute its burgeoning population across the white sands of the Sahara – an Egyptian version of the 19th-century US “manifest destiny” to move west, no matter how punishing the consequences.With Cairo bursting at the seams, plans were drawn up for satellite cities to take the strain. After many failed attempts 10th of Ramadan – a blue-collar industrial city – was the first experimental new city to take shape in the 1970s. Later new cities such as Sheikh Zayed City turned away from these working-class roots to become gated communities for the privileged – high income cities in a low-income country.For four decades the new cities programme has remained the only vehicle for Egypt’s urban development. Today there are 22 built or part-built Egyptian new cities – and the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) has plans for 19 more. Around 7 million people now call these new cities home. It is arguably the most ambitious new cities programme the world has ever seen – a dream of bustling cities in an almost lunar desert landscape that outstrips the visions of even China and India.Named for the beginning of the Arab-Israeli war, the establishment of 10th of Ramadan to the north-east of Cairo was a populist move by an increasingly unpopular President Sadat, who sold it as a grand solution to tackle rampant unemployment, poverty and inflation with 100,000 jobs and half a million homes.Driving there from Cairo today, the cosmopolitan density of downtown soon gives way to miles of mid-rise concrete and brick apartment buildings that look solid, but are notorious for collapsing. Blink and you miss the line where lush date palms and cotton plants become desert sand. An hour after leaving Cairo, you enter 10th of Ramadan.Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea. While the history of cities built from scratch is long, the scale of the current epidemic is beyond anything seen before.\u0026nbspAnother 2.5 billion people are predicted to move to cities over the next 30 years and the trend shows no signs of stopping. New research has identified more than 100 examples, nearly all in Asia and Africa.\u0026nbspThis week  Cities meets the 90-year-olds who built the Bulgarian city of Dimitrovgrad after the second world war (many still live there) and visits the bizarre Bahria Town development promising Karachi residents protection from terror attacks and violent crime.\u0026nbsp We look at Hong Kong’s plan to build artificial islands for 1.1 million people and examine Egypt’s dream to conquer the Sahara. We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?Although the masterplan – drawn up by Egyptian and Swedish engineering firms, and inspired by the modernist principles of Constantinos Doxiadis and the French villes nouvelles – depicts the city as a diamond in the desert, in reality the unfinished city appears to fade out from south to north. It is as though the desert were winning this 40-year struggle.But things here change fast. Every year the half-built new city is filled with more sand-coloured apartment blocks and villas. Huge open spaces, currently home to wandering packs of dogs, are flagged for future development. According to NUCA, 650,000 residents live here. The target is 2.1 million by 2023.Industries – plastics, paper, medical supplies and garment factories – are concentrated in a 10-mile strip along the southeastern edge of the diamond. Egyptian factory owners flocked here in the late 1970s when the government offered attractive incentives and many remain family-owned and operated. Some workers live in employer-provided houses and shared flats, or in dormitories within the factories themselves – but most low-level industrial employees are brought in daily by private buses from surrounding villages.It’s not a beautiful place. Housing is unapologetically bare, apart from the graffiti that covers many ground floor facades. Most public squares and playgrounds are dusty brown.From an ecological standpoint desert cities have obvious challenges, and 10th of Ramadan is no exception. A railway (promised for 40 years) is under construction but at the moment the city is accessible only by car, private minibus or public bus. Notorious traffic jams clog the highway to Cairo. Meanwhile, an aquifer gives 10th of Ramadan independence from the Nile, but makes the city vulnerable to pollution. A 2012 study detected chemical inorganic, biological, organic and bacteriological pollutants in all 31 groundwater samples tested.Still, the joy of public life is evident. Schoolchildren wander the streets and squares, stopping for a soda or kushari, a local street food. Women move in small groups, running errands collectively or gathering children from school. Residents know what cosmopolitan Cairenes think of 10th of Ramadan: that it is a blue-collar city without culture or finesse. But they tell you how much they appreciate the open space, the organisation, the quiet.In the 1970s and 1980s, men came for jobs and brought their families. Life in a city built from scratch can be alienating and lonely. As one first-generation garage owner put it: “The first few years here were the hardest thing I’ve ever done. No friends, no big family, nobody to rely on but ourselves.” But today – even though it remains a struggle to attract new residents – there are second and third generations living here. Even though downtown Cairo is only an hour away, for the residents of 10th of Ramadan the capital may as well be on the other side of the Sahara. In this much, at least, the experimental new city was a success.While 10th of Ramadan and Egypt’s other first generation new cities were industrial at heart, a restructuring from the World Bank and IMF in the 1990s brought a radical shift in policy.Under president Hosni Mubarak, NUCA began selling huge tracts of land to private developers at below market value.The second generation of new cities – exemplified by the gated communities of Sheikh Zayed City – became enclaves for wealthy Cairenes eager to escape the chaos of the capital.Although Sheikh Zayed City - 25 miles to the west of Cairo and named for the emir of Abu Dhabi who helped fund it in 1994 – was originally planned as a mixed-income city, it quickly transformed as NUCA discovered the profit-making potential of land sales to developers. Sheikh Zayed City became one of the first new cities to be filled with gated compounds, popular with the wealthy seeking security, status and privilege.The result is ision. Residents of gated compounds enjoy access to internal shops and clinics, as well as upscale shopping malls accessible only by car. Low income residents rely on limited public transport options to reach cheaper options in nearby satellite cities or in downtown Cairo. “Our demands are quite normal,” said one public housing resident at a recent protest. “Most of us are waiting for services such as shops, pharmacies and schools.”Arriving from Cairo, the first impression of Sheikh Zayed is one of absence: no urban cacophony, no pedestrians. No one walks here – distances are far and walking would imply that one cannot afford a car. The differences between public and private space are striking. Driving around, the city feels most like a collection of inaccessible islands of gated compounds and luxury plazas rather than a coherent whole. Gated compounds present only a glimpse of greenery over the top of high-security fences, and armed guards at the entrances of shopping plazas turn away groups of street children, allowing access only to those who look like they belong in these semi-private spaces. Signs for international franchises such as Starbucks, Baskin-Robbins and Costa Coffee speak to world-class aspirations. Public housing areas, in contrast, exude an atmosphere of general neglect and roadsides are strewn with garbage.The majority of housing in Sheikh Zayed is too expensive for most Egyptians, and like 10th of Ramadan, it has struggled to attract new people. Its current population of 330,000 inhabitants is just under half its target.The problem is exacerbated by private developers who build upmarket properties despite the lack of demand, and many villas lie derelict or unfinished. Layers of graffiti and live-in security guards suggest some have remained uninhabited for years.Speak to many of those who do live here, though, especially those who can afford to live in gated compounds, and many contrast the place positively with Cairo. Cairo is “dirty, overcrowded, unsafe, polluted,” they say Sheikh Zayed is “clean, quiet, well-organised and safe”.One businesswoman in her mid-30s praised Sheikh Zayed City’s “decent malls” and “good supermarkets”. “You feel free,” she added. “There’s no smell. Cairo smells like pigs.” A marketing manager welcomed the lack of “shabby people”. Many were content with the lack of public transport, believing a metro connection to Cairo would attract “the wrong kind” of new resident.These cities are far from full, but the new cities building boom shows no sign of stopping. What motivates Egypt to build more and more cities in the sand when there is such little public demand?According to economist and urban planner David Sims the whole programme may be too big to fail. There are “too many cheerleaders for desert development, too many interests intertwined in this development, and too many client groups to satisfy”. The programme also gives the government something to splash across state media, claiming it has done its job by building new homes, and supplies luxury housing so Egypt’s upper classes can escape from downtown.Last year the government announced an additional 20 new cities to house 30 million residents and be spread throughout Egypt. Among them is a new administrative capital, Wedian City, for 15 million people, to be built to the east of Cairo.It is unclear whether this current generation of new cities will learn from the experiences of four decades of new cities construction, or continue the extreme levels of spatial segregation of Sheikh Zayed City.What is certain, though, is that existing cities are being neglected. As Egypt continues to construct cities from scratch in the sand the aged urban areas of downtown Cairo and Alexandria have no large-scale renovation or upgrading plans. Egypt’s old cities are crumbling to dust.This article is an edited extract from To Build a City in Africa: a History and a Manual by Rachel Keeton and Michelle Provoost, published by NAI010 and the International New Town Institute (INTI)Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa3ce1fd3bbbe13b78aea52bb8fcd69b33d6025/0_60_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91bc074c50bc4018c0f21d473aaf1f8f","title":"islamophobia tory party britain","story":"What Tory members think matters. Their party is in government. They select parliamentary candidates who go on to vote on legislation and become ministers, and they exert pressure on them through local Conservative associations. They are now electing the nation’s prime minister. So when evidence of racism is uncovered among their ranks, it should be regarded as a national scandal.Digest that carefully: more Tory members than not believe that the very presence of minorities has damaged our society. These are far-right beliefs and yet they are mainstream in the party of government.This not to pit Islamophobia against antisemitism in a grotesque racism Olympics. Rather, it is to say that anti-Muslim racism should be treated with the same seriousness as antisemitism. Anti-racism that is not consistent is not anti-racism at all.As a leftwing commentator, I have made every effort to confront antisemitism among my own political bedfellows, writing multiple columns on the subject with headlines such as “Antisemitism has no place in the left. It is time to confront it”. Many of us have gone on TV and radio to excoriate it we damn it in speeches we call it out on social media we demand suspensions from Labour, and that the party do far more to tackle it. Can the same be said of the political right? Too often Tory pundits remain stumm with little consequence, all while adopting a posture of moral self-righteousness towards their opponents. If you care about racism, you have to call it out on your own side, not just focus on your supposed enemies.The Tories are about to elect a man who compared Muslim women to “bank robbers” and “letterboxes”, and described black people as “piccanninies” with “watermelon smiles”. The most prominent Tory female Muslim politician, Sayeeda Warsi, has described Islamophobia as “very widespread” in the party, existing “right from the grassroots, all the way up to the top”. She has also said she was fearful of Michael Gove becoming prime minister because of his views on Muslims. And let us not forget the Windrush scandal. And yet, what outrage? In the face of party inaction, one volunteer is doing the job the Tory machinery should be. @MatesJacob has been using a Twitter account to uncover alleged examples of racism and has forced multiple party suspensions.It would be easy, but facile, to put this all down to partisan sympathies. Yes, there are few fans of the opposition in the media. But it is also down to the basic fact that Islamophobia has become mainstream, acceptable, respectable. Elements of the press have played their part in creating this climate. The Sun splashed on “1 in 5 Brit Muslims’ sympathy for jihadis”, and the Times published “Christian child forced into Muslim foster care”. Both papers were forced to later print corrections to these inaccurate stories, but the damage was done.Of course, antisemitism and Islamophobia are intrinsically linked too. Consider the far-right trope that sinister Jewish power is destroying western society through mass immigration (of Muslims), often through the demonic figure of George Soros. This narrative was used to justify the murderous attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue last October. Consider too the claim that antisemitism within Labour, or the failure to tackle it, is driven by a desire to appease a Muslim “client base”.And yet Islamophobia – within or without our governing party – does not garner the attention it deserves. What lesson is being taught to a generation of Muslims growing up in our society, where the hatred they face is both ignored and normalised? Do people care about racism, or is it simply used as a convenient stick to beat opponents? And what hope do we have of change when a man guilty of using grotesque racist language is on the brink of assuming the highest office in the land?

If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life. Cricket Charity Chance to Shine has introduced 4 million state school children to the game since 2005, 2 million of whom are girls, and NatWest has partnered with the charity to ensure this important work continues.

In 2007-2008, there were 43,530 Chinese students in the UK, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). Ten years later the total went up to 106,530, of which 60,460 were postgraduate students and 46,070 undergraduates.Clare Marchant, Ucas chief executive, said: “The global appeal of UK higher education has never been clearer, with record demographic-beating application rates in England and Wales, and the steep rise in international applications, especially from China.”Chinese students are crucial to Manchester’s ambitions to be a truly international university, says Cotton. “You can’t project yourself as an international university unless you have large cohort of international students. They are bringing connections. In the classroom they can offer an international experience for domestic students.”But there are challenges. Currently Chinese students are concentrated in a limited number of subject areas, such as accounting and finance, economics, business studies and electrical engineering. As a result, they often end up studying in classes full of other Chinese students and socialising together when classes are over.“The challenge for me as a Chinese student is security,” he says. “There are too many robberies. Rumours are that students from China are particularly targeted by robbers. This might be because of the stereotype that Chinese students are crazy rich.”The university says it is doing all it can to improve student safety with regular police drop-in surgeries, the development of a student neighbourhood watch-style group called “student eye” and specific campaigns focussing on international student safety.The university is also developing research to try to find ways to encourage greater integration between Chinese and British students. “Students from both the UK and China are interested in each other,” says Wang, “but it looks like they don’t mix much. There is a cultural barrier.”They also live separately. Chinese students are often in more expensive, purpose-built student flats, while British students live in shared houses. And according to Wang, the two groups socialise in completely different ways. “Chinese students like doing homework together, having a hotpot at home, singing karaoke, going shopping – for some, for luxury goods.“British students particularly enjoy alcohol in pubs with loud music. I’ve heard complaints from my Chinese friends that they couldn’t make many local friends because they just didn’t like pubs.”Nick Hillman is a governor at Manchester university and director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank. Commenting on the latest Ucas application figures, he said: “It’s clear that the UK is benefiting from cooler relations between China and the US, and also between China and Australia. We can’t take anything for certain as demand from other countries is very sensitive to all sorts of things but we are clearly gaining advantage at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/640da84df3dfcb2fdfb50dee1277dfcd4b131a38/0_243_5135_3081/master/5135.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0284babf6058f9af35059ae1ba2168d","title":"global heating london similar climate barcelona 2050","story":"London will have a similar climate in three decades’ time to that of Barcelona today, according to research – but if that seems enticing, a warning: the change could be accompanied by severe drought.Madrid will feel like present-day Marrakech by 2050, and Stockholm like Budapest, according to a report on the likely impacts of the climate crisis. Around the world, cities that are currently in temperate or cold zones in the northern hemisphere will resemble cities more than 600 miles (1,000km) closer to the equator, with damaging effects on health and infrastructure.Among other analogues, the study suggests Moscow will resemble Sofia, Seattle will feel like San Francisco and New York will be comparable to Virginia Beach. The researchers have created an interactive map showing hundreds of cities and their 2050 counterparts.Water shortages will affect scores of cities now in temperate climates as a result of the global heating, which is forecast to be by as much as 3.5C in European cities in summer and 4.7C in winter. Nearly eight in 10 cities will experience dramatic changes, according to the study of 520 major cities published in the journal Plos One.Barcelona was affected by extreme drought just over 10 years ago, endangering many inhabitants and resulting in tens of millions of euros being spent on importing drinking water. It is becoming more likely that London and cities in similar latitudes will experience the same problems in the future, say the researchers.Among the most concerning findings is that the residents of about a fifth of cities globally – including Jakarta, Singapore, Yangon and Kuala Lumpur – will experience conditions currently not seen in any major cities in the world. This unprecedented level of change “blew my mind”, said Tom Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab in Switzerland, which carried out the research.“These are environmental conditions that are not experienced anywhere on the planet at the moment,” he told the . “That means there will be new political challenges, new infrastructure challenges, that we have not faced before.”Rainfall will be a particular problem for such cities, with extreme flooding becoming more common alongside more frequent and severe droughts.Crowther said: “We are absolutely not prepared for this. Planning for climate change needs to start yesterday. The sooner it starts, the less the impact will be.”Richard Betts, a professor of climate impacts at Exeter University and head of the climate impacts strategic area at the Met Office Hadley Centre, who was not involved in the research, said: “Without the benefit of knowing that the new climate conditions are already liveable somewhere in the world, it is harder to know whether people will be able to adapt and stay in these cities, or whether they will eventually look to move elsewhere.”Concern about the world’s lack of preparedness for the effects of global heating is mounting among experts. Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary general’s special representative on disaster risk reduction, last week told the  that climate crisis disasters were happening at the rate of one a week, but that countries were not investing in making urban infrastructure more resistant.On Wednesday, the UK’s Committee on Climate Change published a report saying the government was completely unprepared for the likely repercussions of the climate crisis. Its chairman, Lord Deben, compared preparations to the efforts of the ramshackle troops of the classic British comedy Dad’s Army.The new research took as its baseline one of the central forecasts of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, for a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, which some regard as optimistic considering the current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions.Any London homeowners relishing the prospect of a Catalan climate might need to think again. Mike Lockwood, a professor of space environment physics at Reading University, who was not part of the research team, said: “Bringing Barcelona’s climate to London sounds like it could be a good thing, if you don’t suffer from asthma or have a heart condition – except London clay shrinks and is brittle if it gets too dry, then swells and expands when very wet. The greater swings in ground moisture expected in a warmer world would cause massive subsidence problems.”One of the purposes of the paper is to illustrate the huge problems the world faces as result of the climate emergency. “History has repeatedly shown that data and facts alone do not inspire humans to change their beliefs or act,” said Jean-François Bastin, the lead author of the paper. “The intangible nature of reporting on climate change fails to adequately convey the urgency. It is hard to envisage how 2C of warming, or changes in average temperature by 2100, might impact on daily life.”Friederike Otto, the deputy director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, who was not involved in the research, cautioned that it should be regarded “as an illustration only, not a prediction”, because of the number of variables involved. “It is a useful way to start thinking outside the box, but it does not show London’s future. It could well be that rainfall in winter changes in London in the opposite way to Barcelona.”Mike Childs, the head of science at Friends of the Earth, said policymakers must take note. “What’s great about this report is that it starkly shows what living in cities will be like if the inertia of governments on climate breakdown continues,” he said. “Young people are taking to the streets to stop their futures being wrecked through inaction on the climate crisis, but this analysis demonstrates that anyone under 50 should be equally concerned that urban living could be intolerable by 2050. Governments have no excuse for further inaction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88f4ced6bf9a52deb47ef7e8bc3ea6771e0a5870/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18af097087e50b0a2d4d746d7bb1c121","title":"bolder bottle return scheme could be worth 2bn say campaigners","story":"Restricted scheme would have far less benefit to UK economy, government data suggestsA comprehensive deposit return scheme (DRS) for plastic bottles, cans and glass could boost the economy by £2bn, government assessments show, as ministers weigh up which type of system to adopt.Government data highlighted by the Campaign for the Protection of Rural England indicates that a more restricted DRS involving only bottles of 750ml and under would benefit the economy by just £250m.The campaign group is pressing ministers to adopt a comprehensive scheme when they announce their decision this summer.CPRE says the economic benefits include a reduction in the amount of waste sent to landfill, fewer littered drinks containers and less of their associated cleanup costs, reduced air and water pollution, and less carbon emissions caused by the extraction and production of raw materials needed to produce new drinks containers.It says recycling rates in countries that have such a scheme, including Germany and Norway, are much higher.Maddy Haughton-Boakes, a litter campaigner at CPRE, said: “This is yet more evidence of the positive impact that a deposit return system will have on the whole of society. Taking us towards a circular economy, we will recycle almost all of the drinks cans and bottles we consume, slow down the depletion of scarce resources and reduce carbon emissions, all of which will have a lasting positive impact for our countryside and environment.“The government has an opportunity to ensure England gets the most effective and economically viable deposit system in the world.”Last year the government committed to introducing a scheme and the decision on which type is expected in the next few months.Environmental groups fear ministers are under pressure from industry to restrict the scheme to bottles of 750ml or less that are sold in single units, excluding supermarket-bought multipack bottles and all bottles of more than 750ml.The British Retail Consortium is pushing the government to delay the scheme, saying it is unrealistic to suggest it could be delivered in two years’ time. It supports a scheme for plastic bottles up to 3 litres, but has told ministers the system must not include glass because it would be too expensive and a health and safety risk.The BRC questions whether a DRS is needed at all, saying measures that are due to come into force making producers and retailers pay for the cost of recycling collections should begin and be assessed first.This year the Scottish government announced plans to introduce a deposit return system for glass, plastic, steel and aluminium drinks containers of all sizes.

The density of juvenile coral suggested recovery was possible if there were not further disturbances.He said it indicated there was some resilience in the system but added: “The important thing is the absence of further disturbances. If we have more coral bleaching events all bets are off.”Emslie said the reef’s southern section had escaped the worst effects of coral bleaching and cyclones since 2009 but has been affected by a severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish since 2017. Crown-of-thorns feed on coral and spawns so rapidly it is difficult to tackle once it takes hold. Its spread has been linked to nitrogen from fertiliser and pesticides in agricultural run-off.The broadcaster and natural historian David Attenborough made headlines this week when he told a UK parliamentary committee that the change to the Great Barrier Reef was one of the clearest examples of the climate crisis he had witnessed. He said it was extraordinary that people in power in Australia remained in denial about the scale of the problem.Environment group the Australian Marine Conservation Society said the latest government data showed coral decline was happening on an unparalleled scale, mainly due to the climate crisis. The society’s spokeswoman, Shani Tager, said the reef remained a dynamic place that was home to thousands of animals and supported 64,000 tourism jobs but was in serious trouble.“We need our governments to act fast,” she said.The science record card coincided with the release of an annual work plan by the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a formerly small organisation that was last year granted $443m in public funding despite not having applied for it.The foundation plans to spend $58m this financial year focusing on improving water quality, managing crown-of-thorns starfish and collaborating with the tourism industry to engage visitors in citizen science activities. Anna Marsden, the foundation’s managing director, said innovation would be at the heart of a reef restoration and adaptation program run in collaboration with leading marine science institutions.Richard Leck, from the World Wide Fund for Nature, said the report card showed Australia needed to urgently reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and accelerate a transition to a clean economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8de00c1c9e31a28ba517836c1c7f6fabb06f450e/381_117_1156_693/master/1156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=068f5b8969814303ba1626af14d84d49","title":"queer eyes tan france men can have fun with fashion too","story":"The TV star on how the makeover show changed his look – and why he steers clear of a ‘basic’ black tuxThe Queer Eye guys and I don’t co-ordinate our outfits, we all do our own thing, but it’s weird the number of times we’ve all turned up wearing the same colour story.

Heading online, the ckbk digital library boasts precisely three results for spinach and ricotta cannelloni out of 75,000 on the site, leading me to suspect that, like balti, or General Tso’s chicken, it’s all but unknown in its apparent home country.My Rome correspondents Rachel Roddy and Kristina Gill, however, quickly disabuse me of that notion – indeed, Roddy tells me that at her local fresh pasta shop, cannelloni di ricotta e spinaci now sell better than the classic meat filling. Gill, however, after kindly trawling through “maybe 30 books” in her more extensive collection, confirms that there are surprisingly few published recipes for it, even though The Silver Spoon, often cited as the authority on Italian cuisine, describes spinach and ricotta as the traditional filling for cannelloni.Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that it’s also the classic choice for many other stuffed pastas, and even the crespelle (pancakes) often used instead of pasta in Abruzzo and Campania. The beauty of cannelloni, however, is that they’re incredible easy to make, and bake, hence their popularity on restaurant menus. But what’s the best way to go about it?Strangely enough, the dried tubes of cannelloni I remember from childhood seem to have disappeared from my local supermarket, though they are still available in larger stores. I do have a go with sheets of fresh egg lasagne, however, and can confirm that, if you’re short of time, these also work a treat.Spinach is the preferred choice, obviously – I’d advise searching out bunches of mature stuff, rather than tiny baby spinach leaves sold in supermarkets, which, in my experience, collapse to mush once wilted and baked. If you can’t find them (greengrocers, markets and farm shops are a good source), the next best thing, as Caldesi says, is to buy it frozen, but make sure you get the whole leaf stuff, not the strangely popular pucks of green puree, then defrost and squeeze well before use – any excess liquid will make your filling watery.Christopher Boswell writes in Pasta: Recipes from the Kitchen of the American Academy in Rome that in his kitchen they make these cannelloni with “any greens we have handy. Chard, nettles, turnip tops, cavolo nero and kale all work well.” I try one recipe with cavolo nero, and it proves very popular indeed, the stronger flavour is actually preferred by some of my testers. If you do use more robustly textured greens, cook them in salted water until tender, dunk in cold water, then drain very well before finely chopping.Others add garlic or other aromatics to “bump up the flavour”, as Caldesi puts it – she deploys “soft leaf herbs, such as basil, chives, parsley and oregano”. We all love her cannelloni, but they do taste more of herbs than spinach or ricotta, so if you’re keen for these rather shy and retiring ingredients to remain the stars of the show, I’d recommend sauteeing the spinach in butter with just a little crushed garlic, as the Silver Spoon suggests, to enhance, rather than obscure them.A good sprinkling of salt and a generous grating of nutmeg, which works so well with both ricotta and spinach, are completely non-negotiable.Ricotta is, of course, the order of the day I love it in all its forms, but with such a plain dish, it’s worth buying some really good fresh stuff for this. Many recipes add grated hard cheese to the filling, too – usually grated parmesan, or grana padano in Boswell’s recipe. Bear in mind that if you want to make this dish strictly vegetarian, you’ll need to source a vegetarian alternative they’re widely available these days.Some recipes, though not all, add eggs to the filling as well – or just yolks in the case of Caz Hildebrand and Jacob Kenedy’s The Geometry of Pasta – but I can’t see the point those without are just as good, and I think have a slightly softer, creamier texture.Because cannelloni are baked, they need a sauce, rather than just the drizzle of melted butter you can get away with in other filled pastas. Bechamel and tomato are the two most common choices, and both put in an appearance in Caldesi’s recipe. While in my opinion you can never have too much sauce, it cannot be denied that making two is double the work. What’s more, the overwhelming preference of testers, with the honourable exception of the dog, is for the tomato version, on the basis that “the milky bechamel is too similar to the ricotta”.You could just keep things very simple and, like Boswell, puree a tin of plum tomatoes, but we agree that the plainness of the filling demands a little more in the way of savoury oomph from the supporting sauce: Caldesi’s long-simmered tomato passata, flavoured with vegetables and herbs, is just perfect.We also like her commitment to crisp edges – surely the best bit of almost any gratin – and to this end would recommend not covering the pasta completely with passata. Unless you’re making this for a crowd, however, or have only a very small baking dish to hand, I wouldn’t bother with two layers of cannelloni – sheltered from direct heat, the base layer inevitably goes soggy.In fact, in pursuit of maximum crunch, finishing the dish under the grill, as the Silver Spoon and Pasta Sapori d’Italia suggest, is a very good idea indeed. Adding extra parmesan at this point is between you and your waistband.For the pasta (or use 250g fresh egg lasagne sheets)170g ‘00’ flour80g semolina flour1 big pinch salt2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolkFor the sauce1 tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and cut in half1 carrot, cut in half lengthways1 celery stick, cut in half 800g tinned plum tomatoes1 small bunch basilDash of balsamic vinegar, or ½ tsp sugar and a dash of wine vinegarFor the filling250g fresh mature spinach, or 140g defrosted leaf spinach1 tbsp butter1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed175g fresh ricotta30g Italian hard cheese, gratedNutmegStart with the pasta, if you’re making it yourself. Mix the flours and the salt, make a well in the middle, then pour in the whole eggs and egg yolk. Gradually mix in the flour until you have a dough you can bring together with your hands, adding a splash of water, if necessary.Knead for about 10 minutes, until it feels smooth and springs back when poked, then wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a wide pan over a medium heat, add the onion, carrot and celery, and fry for a couple of minutes, until starting to brown. Tip in the tomatoes, basil and vinegar (or vinegar and sugar), bring everything up to a simmer, then turn down the heat and cook for about half an hour, until thick. Remove and discard the vegetables and herbs, then whizz the sauce with a hand blender (or mash) until fairly smooth, and season to taste.While the sauce is cooking, trim and discard any tough stalks from the spinach and wash the leaves well. Put the still-wet spinach in a saucepan over a medium heat, cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until completely wilted, then run under cold water to prevent it cooking further. Once it’s cool enough to handle, squeeze until dry, then chop finely.Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the garlic, cook for a minute, then add the spinach. Saute to coat with the butter, then turn off and leave to cool.Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is about 1cm thick and will go through the widest setting of your pasta machine comfortably. Put it through each setting but the very narrowest twice – the sheets don’t need to be paper-thin. Cut into pieces about 10cm long, blanch in boiling salted water for a minute, then drain on a clean tea towel.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Mix the spinach with the ricotta and most of the grated cheese, reserving a handful for the top, and season well with nutmeg and salt.Cover the bottom of a medium baking tin with a thick layer of tomato sauce, then put a sausage of filling on the short end of one of the pasta squares and roll up, cutting away any excess once you have a slight overlap. Put the filled tube seam side down in the baking dish, and repeat with the remaining pasta and filling you’ll probably be left with some excess pasta, which will keep in the fridge for several days, stored between greaseproof paper. Tip the remaining sauce on top, leaving a margin around the edge, then bake for 30 minutes.To finish, scatter over the remaining grated cheese, grill until bubbling, then serve.• Spinach and ricotta cannelloni: an understated classic or rightly overlooked by cookbooks?

In summer, we’d go fruit-picking, gather a glut of juicy strawberries and Mum would blend them with sugar and ice to create the most amazing slushies. Being Asian, you’re introduced to chillies and heat early and mum would grind black pepper on top, which brings out the flavour in strawberries.”Joe Wright, chef and co-owner, Porta, Chester“Hot weather encourages simplicity good produce prepared with little faff. The Spanish excel at this. I often recreate a dish I was first served on the beach in Almería: roughly chopped tomatoes, good olive oil, fresh oregano with tinned ventresca tuna. No cooking whatsoever. The Spanish love good tinned seafood and ventresca is the prized tuna belly, line-caught, cooked in seawater, filleted and tinned by hand. It’s food of the gods.”Simon Hulstone, chef-owner, the Elephant, Torquay“I love to gently melt marshmallows in a bain marie to blood temperature, and mix through Rice Krispies. Set it in a tray, cut it into pieces, dip them in melted chocolate and people bloody love ’em. This is Michelin cooking: we only use a top-end Kellogg’s and proper Flumps.”“This is a street snack in India, but I love it as a simple summer salad, too. Chop a cucumber into cubes, sprinkle chaat masala, cumin powder and black salt over and finish with a squeeze of lime juice. On hot days, there’s no better way to cool down.”“In New York, I worked with an Israeli chef, Shlomo Kashy, who introduced me to labneh, basically a Middle Eastern yoghurt.

It was a revelation.”Mary-Ellen McTague, chef-owner, the Creameries, Manchester“The nutty, caramel flavour of burnt butter – beurre noisette in French – lifts everything. You put butter in a pan, apply heat till it turns a nice golden brown, take it off the heat, let it cool and strain it. It will keep for months in the fridge. It’s a brilliant dressing for fish, particularly meaty roast fish such as turbot, and it’s really nice on cabbage and celeriac.

I normally eat it with aubergine and bean curry, but I’ve got many childhood memories of Mum making hot buttered rotis for me to dip in freshly pulped ras.”Stephen Harris, chef, the Sportsman, Whitstable“Simplicity is much easier in summer. I go into my polytunnel, pick a courgette, peel ribbons from it, drizzle them with good olive oil, lime, salt and a few herbs, leave it five minutes and it’s stunning.

Chelsea’s record goalscorer turned head coach had watched his new charges pegged back late on by Bohemians with a goal scored by a trialist on the pitch a matter of minutes. The locals delighted in a chorus of “You’re getting sacked in the morning”, which might even have prompted a wry smile from those in the visitors’ dug-out.These were modest surroundings in which to start his second coming, even if the reception granted Lampard as he conducted a post-match interview pitchside suggested the sense of elation accompanying his appointment has hardly been diminished by a failure to start with a win. The hosts ended with Evan Ferguson, a 14-year-old substitute, curling a vicious shot just wide of a post before Eric Molloy, who once worked part-time in a chocolate factory and is only recently returned from New Zealand, plucked parity, much to the delight of his mother up in the main stand.Bohemians, a team in the midst of their domestic season, had impressed as the game progressed, yet Lampard will not fret too much. This was the first pigeon-step on what will be a slog of season, a campaign that will truly test his coaching credentials. “We have high standards and we have brought that here,” he said. “We need intensity in our game, and I am pleased with the way they have worked and their attitude. Fitness was our issue.”Grander occasions lie ahead. The Chelsea bus had deposited the evening’s squad in the car park on the far side of the stadium around an hour before kick-off, leaving them to trudge across the turf just as the summer drizzle degenerated into a deluge. Lampard, hands initially sunk deep into his white tracksuit top, had been serenaded by the travelling support in the Des Kelly Carpets stand. He had mustered an appreciative wave and a flash of a smile before descending into the home dressing room and the players’ bar, which had been allocated to the visitors given the sheer size of their party.Bruce Buck cut a rather more forlorn figure, hood hoisted up even with a security man shielding him under an umbrella, before retiring to the dry of a crammed directors’ box to sit alongside the recently appointed technical and performance advisor, Petr Cech. The crowd may have fallen well below capacity, but there was still a thrill of anticipation. Pre-season fixtures are hardly accurate gauges of what is to come, but a friendly with the side currently third in the League of Ireland Premier Division would at least provide a first public glimpse of strategy and approach, even in embryonic form.Tactics will evolve as more players return to duty and fitness, and there were only two Europa League winners in his first starting lineup, but here was a Lampard 4-2-3-1 to follow Maurizio Sarri’s 4-3-3. The obvious assumption to draw from that would be N’Golo Kanté, one of 13 players who only arrived in Dublin on Monday, will eventually return to central midfield next term after that season-long dalliance with life in a more attacking brief out on the right under the Italian.The head coach will have Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho available for Saturday’s follow-up against St Patrick’s Athletic. In their absence, this had been the first shot at redemption for those cast aside under Sarri. Danny Drinkwater made his first appearance since a cameo in last season’s Community Shield, anchoring midfield alongside Ethan Ampadu, who had represented Wales more often than Chelsea last time round. The former was understandably rusty, but there was the occasional crossfield pass to catch the eye, and one surge forward which had the mind drifting back to happier times in Leicester’s title winning team.Conor Gallagher, Chelsea’s academy player of the year, epitomised the drive and urgency Lampard will expect from the middle. Then there was Michy Batshuayi, who once sealed the Premier League title for this club but an outcast on loan at Borussia Dortmund, Valencia and Crystal Palace more recently, forever lurking on the shoulder of Bohemians centre-halves. It was the Belgian who collected Kenedy’s deflected shot eight minutes in and rammed home the first goal Lampard had celebrated as head coach. He and his staff spilled uncomfortably from their dug-out, an expanse of empty seats in the deserted stand at their back.The entire lineup was switched at the break, with the presence of the France internationals Kurt Zouma and Tiémoué Bakayoko a reminder of the number of promising talents accumulated, often at considerable expense, by this club over the years. Bakayoko would draw a smart save from James Talbot. Billy Gilmour, a Scotland Under-21 international, would repeat that trick before Molloy had his moment late on. Lampard’s first win will have to wait."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/449b56436ad921eb74bc3dee032cb66e47b12b0b/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ced3d15345bd2b1dc0c4915dd813ae09","title":"flying feet tattoos and chicken masks copa america 2019 in pictures","story":"Five years after hosting the World Cup, Brazil again was home to a major competition this time the Copa América with 12 teams competing over 26 matches.

But this once-powerful businessman is now caught up in a sweeping inquiry that goes to the heart of how a nation is run. By  Mark GevisserOn 17 January this year, South Africans watched, transfixed, as video from a hidden mobile phone camera was broadcast on TV. It showed a group of men, in corporate uniforms, walking into a vault – where one of them counts out bundles of banknotes: “One, two, three, four, five … bloody Monopoly money,” he laughs through heavy breaths, “must be a million.”The man’s name is Gavin Watson, and the whistleblowers who put this video into the public domain claim it shows him counting out bribes to be paid to officials in the South African government. They have given accounts that implicate cabinet ministers, senior lawmakers and even the prosecutors tasked with investigating the corrupt practices of Watson’s logistics company, Bosasa. The video is the most dramatic evidence yet of corruption within the ruling African National Congress (ANC).But Watson is not just another fat-cat industrialist accused of trying to make a fast buck by bribing officials: his family were legendary in the anti-apartheid movement. He is the oldest of four brothers from the Eastern Cape province, white men who became heroes to the black majority when they broke apartheid laws to play rugby with black people in 1976. They joined the banned ANC and faced numerous depredations by the apartheid state, including time in jail and assassination attempts.The youngest brother, Daniel (known as Cheeky), was the most gifted wing player of his generation, who gave up a Springboks blazer for his stand against apartheid. All four brothers left their whites-only teams and went to play for the black league in their home town, Port Elizabeth, one of the only parts of the country where black people as well as white were rugby-mad. In 2012, Cheeky Watson received a state honour for his fearless contribution to non-racial sport.Watson and his brothers owned a highly successful chain of menswear shops, aimed at black buyers. As white people with resources, they provided invaluable support to their black ANC comrades in the Eastern Cape. At a time when many freedom fighters espoused a racially exclusive “black consciousness” agenda, they also helped set the ANC’s non-racial policies in motion on the sportsfield.After the ban on the ANC was lifted in 1990, the Watson brothers became powerbrokers in both politics and business. They set up companies, fronted by black owners and managers, that obtained shares in mining companies and contracts from the state. “Black economic empowerment” (or BEE) is the state’s primary means of economic redistribution, an affirmative-action plan stipulating that anyone wishing to do business with the state has to have a certain quota of black ownership and management. On paper, Gavin Watson’s company, Bosasa, was majority black-owned as such, it garnered contracts worth $140m from the state between 2000 and 2016, from prison catering to fleet management and information technology.According to the testimony of four whistleblowers, all former Bosasa executives, around $5m was paid in bribes to secure these contracts. They allege an industrial-scale operation that generated cash through money laundering and then distributed it to buy influence, secure contracts and prevent prosecution. They have described cash stuffed into Louis Vuitton handbags as gifts, or handed over in monthly instalments on the sides of highways. State officials received cars and houses free security equipment and school fees for their children – even monthly meat supplies.Jacob Zuma, the former president, has been named in testimony as allegedly receiving gifts from Watson and playing a role in stopping the prosecution of his company, which first came under investigation in 2007. And even Cyril Ramaphosa, the current president, elected on the promise that he would sweep away corruption, unwittingly accepted a donation from Watson to help him in his campaign to unseat Zuma Bosasa also paid Ramaphosa’s son Andile a consulting fee for “advisory services”.Black economic empowerment aims to give black people a greater share of an economy still overwhelmingly owned by whites. But the evidence given to the inquiry against Gavin Watson and Bosasa suggests how easily manipulated it can be: the accusation against Watson is that he and his colleagues have abused the system to line their own pockets, and have “captured” the organs of state to do so.“State capture” has become a buzzword in South Africa. It describes the way private iniduals and companies have commandeered organs of state to redirect public resources into their own hands, and have gutted those institutions responsible for protecting the country against such corruption. These include the police, the prosecution authority, the tax collection service and even parliament itself.If the whistleblowers’ evidence is correct, Bosasa was a textbook case of state capture. They presented the vault video, along with a blizzard of documents and allegations, at South Africa’s independent judicial inquiry into allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector, chaired by the country’s deputy chief justice, Raymond Zondo. Zondo began public hearings last August, and they are expected to continue, almost daily, until the end of this year. The state capture commission, as it is known, has been described as a truth and reconciliation commission for our times. Its aim is to cleanse post-apartheid South Africa of its darkest stain, just as Desmond Tutu sought to bring about a healthy transition into the new era by exposing the apartheid years’ gross violations of human rights.The commission’s primary target is the kleptocracy that established itself around the former president Jacob Zuma, and particularly the dealings of another band of brothers, the Guptas, who allegedly ran Zuma’s government as a private piggy-bank. Zuma himself will finally appear before Zondo next week: he is scheduled to be in the witness box for five days, answering questions primarily about his relationship with the Guptas and the decisions that arose out of this. But he is expected to address the allegations about Bosasa and Gavin Watson, too.Gavin Watson has declined to make any public comment since the allegations, but his brother Valence told me: “Our constitutional rights have been trampled upon.” Valence claims that his family are victims of a “dark state” conspiracy today, just as they were under apartheid. He claims that the commission is illegal, in that it has not offered those implicated by the whistleblowers a fair hearing.Although the whistleblowers have implicated all four brothers in their testimony before the commission, only Gavin is directly linked to Bosasa. On the basis of the tax-evasion allegations put before the commission, Gavin is now being investigated by the South African Revenue Service. And in an unrelated case, a high court has found him to have “acted dishonestly and reprehensibly” in a mining deal, by taking shares allocated to a “black economic empowerment entity and appropriating them to himself and his family”.The whistleblowers’ testimony sketches one of the most troubling dynamics of post-apartheid South Africa: as some freedom fighters went into politics and others went into business, support networks morphed into patronage networks, which in turn became criminal syndicates.The Watson brothers were such celebrities in the 1980s that there was even a TV series about them in the works. In a world where rugby was “next to God”, John Pilger wrote in an introduction to a 1997 book about them, they “embodied almost everything that white South African men liked about their breed: they were physically brave … men’s men. Even their Christianity fitted the mould. But their manliness and their faith embraced a universal humanity and morality that was the antithesis of this stereotype.”Television only came to South Africa in 1975, and at the time the Watsons were making news for their stand, the country was obsessed with Dallas, the Texas oil saga that centred on the Ewing family. “They were just like the Ewings,” the former journalist Cate Turner, who fell into their orbit, said to me. “I was starstruck. The Herald had them on the front page every other day: these compelling, good-looking guys and their wives with big hair and shoulder pads.”While Cheeky managed black rugby teams and Gavin ran the family business, the other two brothers, Ronnie and Valence, became underground operatives of the ANC. Ronnie, Valence and Cheeky spent four months in jail after they were charged with burning down their grand family home in an insurance fraud. They insisted the state had framed them, and were eventually acquitted. Their chain of stores, Dan Watson American Imports, had been phenomenally successful, but they went bankrupt shortly after the trial. It took them several years, after the fall of apartheid, to re-establish themselves as BEE entrepreneurs – and to bring many of their old comrades with them, into the business world.Recently, on a visit to Port Elizabeth, I met one of their former comrades, Mike Xego, a former political prisoner who is now a businessman. He drives a Mercedes with the plates “Mr X”, a moniker he also has stitched on to a necktie that is almost as broad as his language. “You must understand, black people are fucking poor,” he exploded, when I asked him why corruption had become so rife in South Africa. “Our ambitions! We wanted to be proper human beings, with bank accounts and a tie. We thought we would be strutting up and down the streets. Then things really crumbled. It didn’t go well for most of us. We remained where we were.”South Africa was recently declared by the World Bank to be the world’s most unequal country. In the boom years after the 1994 transition away from apartheid, if you were fortunate enough to be politically connected, you could soar into the stratosphere of the very wealthy via canny partnerships with white capitalists. This was Cyril Ramaphosa’s route. But, many black people were unable to access these opportunities, writes the South African sociologist Karl von Holdt, “because of political gatekeeping or because they lacked the capital or the skills”. And so “an alternative, informal political-economic system” emerged, through which “networks of state officials, ambitious entrepreneurs and small-time operators, were rigging tenders or engaging in other kinds of fraud … to sustain or establish businesses, or simply to finance self-enrichment”. Von Holdt argues that for some South Africans, criminality has become the route to class mobility.Of course, white South Africans had accumulated their wealth through their own affirmative-action programmes – job reservation for whites – and alliances with the state. Now, post-apartheid, BEE had two distinct, legitimate arms: the private sector handed over some of its assets to players like Ramaphosa in return for political access and government work, and the state set race quotas for public sector contracts and mining licences.The entrepreneurial – white – Watson brothers, seeing how they could parlay their political networks into deals, went down both tracks. Gavin built Bosasa, a company initially founded by leaders of the ANC Women’s League, to gain a foothold in the economy through government business. His younger brothers Valence and Ronnie went into the mining sector, working with a controversial family who bankrolled the ANC Youth League, and bought up marginal goldmines that the big players were getting ready to shut down.To find partners in these ventures, the brothers dug into their political hinterland: they recruited former comrades from ANC intelligence, rugby buddies from the black leagues, Eastern Cape activists. Gavin and Valence gave a major stake in their own companies to a man everyone calls “the fifth brother”, Archie Mkele, a black rugby legend they befriended when they crossed over to the black league. Mkele was severely burned in the Watsons’ 1986 fire, and then tortured into a confession that he had torched the house for his friends as part of the alleged insurance scam in court, he refused to testify against them. The other suspect, another black rugby mate, turned state witness, but was discharged after evidence emerged that he, too, had been tortured.Bosasa’s other major black shareholder is Mkele’s ex-wife, Carol, the sole beneficiary of a “women’s investments” trust. On paper, the Mkeles are very rich indeed, but they lead modest lives in Port Elizabeth: Carol – now named Muneira Oliveria – has a mid-level management job at Bosasa Archie is a priest. The whistleblowers allege in their testimony to the inquiry that the Mkeles’ investment trusts are fronts for Gavin Watson’s own family.Several of the Watsons’ other BEE partners became part of the country’s new political elite there was a revolving door, in these first years of the new government, between political appointments and BEE entrepreneurs. “The minute you have a system where people make money just by the connections they have, rather than the work that they do, the system is ripe for abuse,” says the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, long a staunch critic of BEE. “It’s a recipe for corruption.”But a perfect storm was brewing: the aspirations that accompanied democracy were maturing at the same time as South Africa’s post-apartheid growth spurt slowed down, and the economy slumped after the global crash of 2008. As unemployment became more severe, public-service salaries and social welfare grants had to feed an increasing number of people. And as the cost of living soared, it became harder for many people to keep a foothold in the middle class: paying off the mortgage on your home keeping your kids in private schools.Central to this political economy is the ANC itself, which makes key appointments, from a local to a national level, except in those few parts of the country where it is no longer in power. The party subsists on donations, and there have been allegations that votes for leadership positions are for sale. There are no controls over campaign financing in South Africa, and so an operation like Bosasa can work on two levels: underground, through bribery, and above board, through making high-profile donations to the party, or running and staffing – as Bosasa did – huge campaign “war rooms” for the ANC out of its head office.“It is impossible to quantify the level of corruption in South Africa,” David Lewis of Corruption Watch, the South African chapter of Transparency International, told me, “but everyone accepts a perception, which is often the only way you make a judgment, that bribery in order to procure public contracts is ubiquitous.”A young business colleague of Mike Xego’s had accompanied him to our meeting, and when “Mr X” jumped up to take a phone call, I struck up a conversation with this man. He was trying to make a go of it, he told me, bringing potatoes from farms to market in his truck, and carrying fuel back. “But the problem is capital.” He had begun his business by bidding for state tenders, and received a sub-contract helping to build a road in his home township. But as soon as he made enough money to buy his truck, he got out of there.Why did he leave if he was doing so well there, I asked, and if state contracts could build his capital base?Judge Raymond Zondo is a mild and ponderous man in his late 50s who runs his commission with a sometimes-exasperating deliberateness. After viewing the video of Gavin Watson counting out those bundles of banknotes in the vault, he asked his witness – former Bosasa executive Angelo Agrizzi – what Watson had meant by referring to the cash as “monopoly money”.Agrizzi told the judge that he had experienced a Damascene conversion after surviving a heart tumour. The Watson camp suggests, with evidence, that he was trying to blackmail Gavin Watson. Agrizzi, in turn, claims Watson was going to throw him under the bus, and so he acted pre-emptively. Certainly, Agrizzi appears to have accumulated evidence, perhaps as insurance. He kept meticulous coded records: of the transfer of orders of “chicken”, or of “bread” in and out of the “oven”, as the vault was known – in what he liked to call his “little black books”, personalised and gold-embossed from Smythson in London. Even the state capture commission’s own secretary, a senior justice department official named Khotso De Wee, was to be found in these books, and had to be put on special leave by Zondo. De Wee has denied the allegations.Two characters were inscribed every month into Agrizzi’s dirty little ledger as “Snake” and “Snail”. Agrizzi told the commission that these were Nomgcobo Jiba, the deputy national director of public prosecutions and Lawrence Mrwebi, who headed a unit of the prosecuting authority that had, in fact, been investigating Bosasa since 2010. Agrizzi’s testimony suggested why, almost a decade later, no one had yet been charged: in his account, Jiba and Mrwebi were paid off to obstruct the prosecution – and even to advise the accused on how to circumvent the charges.Both Mrwebi and Jiba have denied Agrizzi’s allegations, and claim they never received money from Bosasa. In April, they were fired by Cyril Ramaphosa, on the basis of another judicial commission that found they had brought the agency into disrepute: not over Bosasa, but other matters that had to do with protecting Jacob Zuma and his cronies from charges of corruption.Shortly after Agrizzi made his revelations before the commission in January this year, the National Prosecuting Authority snapped into gear under a new boss. Although the state capture commission offers protection from self-incrimination, prosecutors used the charge sheet that had been gathering dust at the agency to arrest Agrizzi and two other Bosasa whistleblowers, as well as two prison officials.One of Agrizzi’s co-accused is a man named Linda Mti, an ex-ANC military commander who was the head of security at the 2010 South Africa World Cup and, before that, the country’s prisons commissioner. Hard-driving and charismatic, Mti is still known by his nom de guerre, “Richman”. He likes to tell the story of how, one day in 1980, while he was working out of the neighbouring country of Lesotho, two conservatively dressed young white men were brought to see him. His mother had joked that he might live to see the day that he could tell a white man what to do, and “now I’ve got two. My whiteboys!”The men were Ronnie and Valence Watson, and they had come to Lesotho at the behest of Chris Hani – the legendary ANC leader, who was later assassinated – smuggling forged documents across the border in their big white Mercedes. Mti became their handler, and in the years that followed, the Watson boys shuttled fleeing activists across the same border, along with intelligence reports about what was happening back home. Both Mti and Hani became close personal friends of the Watsons.When, in 1987, an attempt was made on Ronnie Watson’s life in a hotel room in Botswana, it was Richman Mti who came running to his aid. Three years later, when the last white president, FW de Klerk, unexpectedly unbanned the liberation movements and Mti came back to Port Elizabeth, his hometown, he had nowhere to live. Valence Watson put him up, and he lived there for many months. Mti was elected the first ANC chair of the region the brothers became his fixers and advisers. (Mti declined to speak to me for this story.)Mti became prisons commissioner in 2001, a year after Gavin Watson bought Bosasa: the company provided catering for mine hostels, and ran two detention centres, one for illegal immigrants and one for juvenile offenders. Watson was ready to expand. His man was in place.The state had never previously outsourced its prisons contracts, but inspired by the success of British companies such as G4S and Serco, Bosasa made a pitch to Mti and another senior prison official, Patrick Gillingham, for all the catering contracts in the country’s prisons. According to testimony given to the inquiry and the charge sheet, both men conspired to award Bosasa the prison catering contracts, for which they received lucrative kickbacks, in cash and in kind.A senior career official in the apartheid-era prisons service, Gillingham would have been a strong candidate for prisons commissioner were it not for the timing of the transition to democracy, and the ANC’s affirmative-action policies: he is white. When Agrizzi was trying to explain how he, too, became corrupt while working for Bosasa, he told Zondo: “We were constantly told that we were white males and that you will not find a job anywhere out there … This was drummed into our heads.” Similar statements were made by the other whistleblowers, all white men too. I have seen a video in which Watson does, indeed, emphasise to his white staff their unemployability in a changing South Africa.And so, according to the testimony before the state capture commission, Watson played race two ways. He offered his black collaborators a quicker route to self-enrichment than might otherwise be available to them, and his white ones a solution from the impoverishment they imagined might befall them, now that black South Africans were in the ascendant.When Mike “Mr X” Xego was released from five years in jail on Robben Island in 1982, he was 22 and had no clothes his mother, a domestic worker, could not help. “Go to the Watsons!” he was told. “They will make you look good.” Even before they became rugby heroes, the brothers were renowned in Port Elizabeth’s black community for their shop, which sold the kind of American fashion beloved by urban black South Africans. Most of the customers were black, but white people shopped there too, meaning it was one of the few mixed spaces in the city, a free zone for black people, and a safe space for activists. With their resources, the Watsons did what they could, setting up a makeshift clinic in the storeroom and tending to comrades injured in protests photocopying banned literature gifting clothes to released prisoners like Xego or returned exiles like Richman Mti.Xego acquired his first wardrobe – on credit, with no interest – from the Watsons. A few weeks later, all four brothers showed up in their Mercedes at his tiny township home and sat down to tea with his mother, winning her over with the fluent Xhosa they had learned growing up on an Eastern Cape farm. They wrote off his debt.Port Elizabeth had always been the heart of the freedom struggle and it was here, after the apartheid president PW Botha declared his state of emergency in 1985, that a nationwide consumer boycott of white businesses was most successful. What to do with the Watsons, though?At first they were exempt, but the boycott leaders insisted that they needed to be included: it would be too easy for other retailers to superficially imitate the Watson packaging. Worse yet, vigilantes were enforcing the boycott with violence. If people were found breaking the boycott by coming home from the shops with detergent, for example, they would often be forced to drink it. The only way people could be safe, the leaders insisted, was if the boycott was a blanket one. Others disagreed fervently: “To us the Watsons were not whites,” their friend Max Mamase told the Australian journalist Kristin Williamson. “They were part of us. But a few key people felt the Watsons were making money out of the boycott.”This was significant because of the factionalism in the struggle. You could tarnish your competitors with the slur that they were agents or informers. Ronnie Watson in particular was the master of this game: he had a favourite Xhosa word he would hiss under his breath about anyone who disagreed with him: inywagi – the genet, a small, wily wild cat that struck its prey with lightning speed. “Black or white, we were all spies to them,” Jack told me.The brothers stayed away from the above-ground movement, which was launched in 1983 as the United Democratic Front. When the journalist Gavin Evans set up a UDF affiliate with two other white activists, “they were very threatened,” Evans told me. “They liked to be the only white activists in the village. In various ways, they spread spy rumours about all three of us.”Obviously, Gavin Watson did not clothe people like Richman Mti in the 1980s in anticipation of a future lucrative relationship: no one could have predicted, back then, how quickly apartheid would fall and a new elite would establish itself. But the testimony before the state capture commission suggests a slippery slope: from comradely support into patronage and – in some cases – corruption.In this way, the Watson brothers are reminiscent of another famous struggle family, the Shaiks. The sons of an Indian trader from Durban, the Shaik brothers were deeply committed freedom fighters, and were often detained and even tortured. They answered directly to Jacob Zuma in exile, and they provided both intelligence and resources to the movement.The ANC’s leaders – in jail or in exile – had not a penny to their name, but were expected to take their seats at the negotiating table after their release or return after 1990, and talk themselves into power. Even Nelson Mandela was dependent on the largesse of local businessmen when he came out of jail, supported primarily by a brash insurance magnate named Douw Steyn (although there was no suggestion of an illegal relationship). Richman Mti had the Watsons. And Jacob Zuma had the Shaiks.Schabir Shaik bribed Zuma to get a piece of a multibillion dollar arms deal that South Africa signed with French and German companies in the mid-1990s. Shaik went to jail in 2005, and the reason Zuma is free is because a judge accepted testimony that the charges against him were tainted by political interference. This ruling was finally overturned on appeal in 2018, and the charges were reinstated: the former South African president may yet find himself behind bars.In an image-laundering exercise, Bosasa changed its name to African Global Operations in 2016. Its headquarters are a sprawling campus in a nondescript suburb west of Johannesburg. In its heyday the campus had wildlife roaming around it, a mini golf course, the Watson Corporate University, an evangelical publishing company and a wellness centre. Since the allegations made at the state capture commission earlier this year, the company has lost most of its business and gone into liquidation: most of its staff have been retrenched and its banks have refused to do business with it. Most of the campus’ buildings are dark, and it now has an unkempt air at odds with the regimental Watson style.Gavin Watson liked to call Bosasa a “Kingdom company”: he ran it with a kind of entrepreneurial evangelism. All staff were required to wear smart uniforms, and Watson conducted prayer meetings and offered communion every morning between 6am and 8am. A popular public speaker on behavioural science who ran the wellness centre for over a decade, Denise Bjorkman, says that Bosasa was “a cultish environment” with Watson its domineering leader, and that his “control mechanisms extended into prayer”, as staff members felt compelled to attend if they wished to be in favour. “Attendees had to pray out loud as he believed that if they did so he would know what they were thinking,” Bjorkman says.In April this year, Valence Watson agreed to spend a day with me, first in the Port Elizabeth offices of his lawyers, and then showing me Royalston, the magnificent “coastal wildlife residential estate” he is developing outside the city. He is known to be the most affable of the four bluff brothers: he was good company, despite the difficult conversation.Valence explained the family ethos to me, and how it was rooted in both enterprise and Christianity. His farming parents, descendants of hardy Scots settler stock, also ran trading stores, and there were two biblical precepts that governed their lives: “Love your neighbour as yourself” and “Earn your money by the sweat of your brow”. For the Watsons, “everyone’s money was the same colour”, and the first time he realised it was different elsewhere was when he noticed a wall in the local butchers, iding black and white shoppers.Although all four brothers are implicated by the whistleblowers at the state capture commission, Valence insisted to me that they had no relationship with their brother Gavin’s company Ronnie said the same thing, in a written response to questions. (Cheeky declined to talk to me.) There is, indeed, no evidence that they were directly involved in corruption, except for Agrizzi’s allegation that he saw Valence bribing a senior parliamentarian named Cedric Frolick on behalf of Bosasa. Valence dismissed this charge to me as a lie.Still, everyone who knows the Watson family notes the way the brothers band together, particularly in times of trouble. Perhaps because of the way they were once isolated by other whites as kaffirboeties (“nigger-lovers”) and then targeted by the authorities, they tend to close ranks and keep to themselves, and in my own dealings with them – perhaps exacerbated by their current embattled status – I experienced their notorious “us-versus-the-world” paranoia.“Stratcom” is short for “Strategic Communications”, the apartheid security forces’ notorious dirty tricks department, which sought to discredit key apartheid activists. (Stratcom may have been responsible, for example, for burning down the Watson house and then manufacturing documents to make it look like an insurance scam.) When I asked Valence who might be behind such a plot, today, he suggested that Agrizzi and the whistleblowers were in cahoots with the opposition Democratic Alliance, in an attempt to discredit the ANC before the country’s May elections, in which the party was re-elected, but with its lowest majority yet.Presumably on the basis of the Bosasa allegations, Cyril Ramaphosa dropped at least one implicated cabinet minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, a close Zuma associate who was allegedly at the heart of the Bosasa syndicate, and Watson’s primary beneficiary. Mokonyane has called the allegations untrue, and announced her intention to defend herself before the commission. Ramaphosa has also apologised for the error in judgment in having accepted funds from Watson, given that Bosasa was under investigation. Still, he now finds himself under investigation too, by an antagonistic public protector (a statutory ombudsman of sorts) who believes that he wilfully misled parliament, and might even be guilty of money-laundering through his campaign fundraising.The public protector’s name is Busisiwe Mkhwebane. So aggressively has she gone after Ramaphosa and his major anti-corruption ally, the state enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan, that many South Africans believe she is doing the bidding of the Zuma kleptocrats swept from office by Ramaphosa – allegations that Mkhwebane says are “unfair” and “without basis”. Meanwhile, Zuma will appear before Zondo next week, against his will. In a letter leaked to the press, his lawyer has slammed the commission as seeking its “own truth” and wishing “to deliver our client … for public display and in order to ambush and humiliate him”.The allegations against Bosasa and Gavin Watson are by no means the only ones that have been made before Zondo, or even the most damning, in terms of “state capture”. But they are the most detailed. The way the South African authorities act on them will be a litmus test of whether they are, finally, freed from their “capture” during the dark second act – the Zuma years – of the South African democracy.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/019da3b936fcb3d7f5dadec27a9fd90b973410fc/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d200c85535913c26664b0beaf97fcb3","title":"a different way of sitting on the fence readers on corbyns brexit","story":"You have been reacting in the comments as Labour’s leader said it would campaign for remain in a referendumJeremy Corbyn finally gets off the fence. If only he’d have set this out in December, when Theresa May was struggling to get the withdrawal agreement through Parliament. The whole approach by everyone would have been different for the first half of 2019, and we wouldn’t be facing the imminent threat of Boris Johnson as PM. SimonLegendThis is just a different way of sitting on the fence. The indecision and confusion continue. PaperAxeLabour has actually always been remarkably consistent about its Brexit policy. People may not like Labour’s Brexit policy, they may wish that it were different. Plenty of people within the party fall into those categories. But it is just disingenuous to say that Labour doesn’t have a position or that its position is unclear.Corbyn is just spelling out what has been said many times before: the ideal scenario is a general election, a Labour victory and Brexit on Labour’s terms. Failing that, a second referendum and backing remain (for now). PortalooCorbyn has done the right thing in finally coming out in support of remain in a second referendum. If a handful of Tories stick with their principles and vote with Labour a second referendum would hopefully give us a clear remain vote. Pull us back from the last three years of utter madness that have alienated us from allies and weakened the fabric of society that binds us all. Kingpin300Labour’s so-called policy change on Brexit is no such thing. Their policy is still to back a Labour Brexit deal but oppose a Tory Brexit deal. We’ve known that for some time. Labour didn’t back May’s EU withdrawal agreement, and backed amendments for another referendum in parliament.To say that Labour will oppose a Tory Brexit, but support a Labour Brexit deal, is simply no change at all. BudaneveyThe absolute proof of the pudding for Labour – and the only way they will win back support – is to now be seen to actively and aggressively promote a second referendum as a solution. Simply announcing it as a policy position and then going back to talking about buses is not anywhere near enough. There has to be genuine commitment. SmallHeathernThe fact that in July 2019, Labour feels it has to state they would campaign for remain against no-deal or a Tory deal speaks volume about the level of irrelevance they have fallen to regarding Brexit.In the fine print, they also say that in the unlikely event of an emergency landing of Corbyn in Number 10, they would not revoke Article 50 but seek for another deal with the EU (the same deal but painted red). ID7903204I am now watching Labour closely. If this turns out to be what it is trying to look like they may have my vote again. But I am not going to give my support until it is absolutely clear that there is no between the lines Lexit hidden here.But on what’s been said so far, I will vote with Labour in the event of GE. Lynden71I see nothing in Labour’s recent policy announcement on Brexit that’s going to make want to switch back to supporting them. Apart from anything else, Corbyn simply can’t be trusted to see through what he’s currently promising. I’m half-expecting a half-retraction later today, rowing back on the pledge. GalvestonPeople don’t understand that Corbyn coming out and supporting remain will boost the Tories. They’ve been praying for Corbyn to play the big remain bogeyman for three years and he has (correctly) refrained to doing this. This announcement will fuel the Conservatives who still (probably) hold a very slim majority. What’s for sure is that both the Tories and the anti-Corbynites have been trying to set up Corbyn for failure ever since he got the Labour PLP.Seeing the absolute derision with which this is being met in the Remain camp ... it’s quite clear that all the Corbyn bashing of the last three years has worked wonders. Voltaire21Seems fair. Corbyn coming under a lot of attacks, but there is very little else they can do. As opposition, they cannot trigger a general election or demand a new referendum even if they want to, because the power to do so lies solely in the hands of the Conservatives.The referendum should never have happened, and ever since that date, Corbyn and the Labour party should have come out clearly in favour of the half the country that voted remain, knowing what a Tory Brexit would mean. That they didn’t is on them.But at this point, and with a Johnson government looming on the horizon, I don’t really see what else they could do than try to force his hand, which is the purpose of today’s letter. danielplainview"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43a08c7b2369d727ded2e960e17dc3d9e7777a31/0_138_3011_1806/master/3011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eaf4373504006a931c801d6674d0549","title":"kim darroch resignation effect international diplomacy experts","story":"UK ambassador to the US’s departure may prompt ‘very big change’ in how international diplomacy is conductedThe resignation of Sir Kim Darroch as the UK’s ambassador to the US after controversy over leaked memos in which he criticized Donald Trump could have a chilling effect on international diplomacy, experts have warned.Veteran diplomats defended Darroch’s confidential memos – in which he referred to the Trump administration as “incompetent” and “inept” – as the nature of an ambassador’s job.“He reported as he saw fit, he advised as he saw fit, and he did it on a classified cable,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations and former US diplomat. “This is what ambassadors are meant to do.“He doesn’t do the prime minister or the foreign minister any favors if he doesn’t give his honest take or his honest advice,” Haass added. “It’s not his fault the cable leaked.”The senior civil servant at the Foreign Office called a meeting of all staff to reassure diplomats unnerved by the shock resignation and its potential impact on British state craft.Sir Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador, tweeted: “An utter outrage that Kim Darroch has been brought down by a disgraceful leak and the vindictive reaction of the US President. Sir Kim is blameless in this sorry affair.”Darroch submitted his resignation on Wednesday, three days after his private assessments of the Trump administration were leaked to the Mail on Sunday. In addition to characterizing the current administration as “dysfunctional”, Darroch said the US president “radiates insecurity”.The comments swiftly ignited a diplomatic row between the US and the UK, and Trump vowed to no longer deal with Darroch, lambasting the UK’s top diplomat as “a very stupid guy”. Trump also attacked the outgoing British prime minister, Theresa May, who stood by Darroch.Darroch’s decision to leave his post was nonetheless cemented by the Conservative leadership debate on Tuesday, in which frontrunner Boris Johnson repeatedly declined to say if he would retain the ambassador through his scheduled departure of January.“The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like,” Darroch wrote in a resignation letter on Wednesday.After lashing out at Darroch in a series of tweets over the past two days, Trump had yet to weigh in on Darroch’s departure. Marc Short, the chief of staff to the vice-president, Mike Pence, said the move was “probably the right course”.“I think the reality was that in light of the last few days his ability to be effective was probably limited,” Short told reporters on Wednesday.A state department spokeswoman said: “The United States and the United Kingdom share a bond that is bigger than any inidual, and we look forward to continuing that partnership.”Darroch’s fate was met with dismay by those who knew him in Washington, where he had cultivated the reputation of a deft diplomat whose parties at the British embassy were coveted social affairs, often attended by members of the Trump administration.“Up until this, I think diplomats were able to communicate to their governments with honest and valuable information,” said Sally Quinn, a former journalist and socialite who regularly attended Darroch’s parties. “Clearly, we can’t do that anymore.“I think it’s going to be a very big change in the way diplomacy is conducted.”Darroch had close ties with the Trump administration. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, the president’s daughter and son-in-law, both senior advisers in the West Wing, frequented his parties, as did former White House press secretaries Sarah Sanders and Sean Spicer.Quinn said Trump’s frustration was probably rooted in knowing that the source of Darroch’s information was his own staff.“He entertained constantly at the embassy and he entertained Trump people, because they like him,” Quinn said. “It’s embarrassing for Trump, because he’s got to know it’s coming from the inside.”Darroch was far from alone within the diplomatic community in his assessment of Trump, she added.“There is not a single word Kim wrote that isn’t absolutely accurate and isn’t the prevailing view in Washington,” Quinn said. “It could have been anyone.“Every single diplomat is looking at him and saying, ‘There but for the grace of God go I.’”Even some of Trump’s Republican allies spoke out in Darroch’s favor.“Kim Darroch did an outstanding job as Ambassador and sorry to see he has resigned his post,” the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham tweeted, seeking to distance Trump from Darroch’s resignation by adding he had “got a raw deal” from the media.The Utah senator Mitt Romney said he was “disappointed” to see Darroch go. “He is a fine man,” Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, told reporters, adding: “The lack of security on diplomatic communication within a government is a real problem.”Darroch was appointed to the post of UK’s envoy to the US in 2015 after serving as David Cameron’s national security adviser. That experience made him a key player in coordinating with Washington on complex issues that ned Russia to Brexit.Kate Greer, who worked alongside Darroch from 2015 through 2018, said he played a critical role behind the scenes in the international response to Russia’s 2018 nerve agent attack on British soil and also worked closely with the US government to provide support for those impacted by the hurricane that hit Florida, the Gulf and the British Virgin Islands in 2017.“It’s been a tricky and challenging political environment on both sides of the ocean,” she said. “The leaks were clearly politically motivated and leaked from someone in London as part of this leadership contest and part of this political debate.”Haass said Darroch’s decision to resign was ultimately in the service of the UK’s incoming leadership.“He allowed the next prime minister not to have to choose between protecting his ambassador and protecting the relationship with the United States,” Haass said, while adding he did not believe Darroch’s legacy would be greatly tarnished by the circumstances around his departure.“This was his last post anyhow. As he rides into the sunset, a lot more people know who Kim Darroch is now than they would have a week ago.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df84c78e35e5c3a2e81866aeaf433c7bc3afc3f/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f436f4b5740bba181b701e30c2b2902d","title":"our man in the us wins scant support from either party leader","story":"At PMQs neither May nor Corbyn seemed outraged by the resignation of Kim Darroch as US ambassadorThe gaps on the benches grow larger every week as more and more MPs follow their therapists’ advice and steer clear of prime minister’s questions. Yet there is still a hardcore of some 250 or so who can’t resist their weekly self-harm fix. A session guaranteed to leave everyone involved feeling cheapened and no more informed. The irony is that the biggest masochists are the two main protagonists. There can’t ever have been two party leaders less suited to PMQs. Or to leading their parties for that matter.Here was Jeremy Corbyn’s chance to shine. To steer the conversation away from Labour’s problems with antisemitism and desperate poll ratings and put the government on the spot over Kim Darroch’s decision to resign as UK ambassador to the US. Merely for doing his job. How did Theresa May feel about the US government dictating who it would and would not tolerate as our ambassador? How did she feel about Boris Johnson effectively triggering Darroch’s resignation with his refusal to back him?Here too was May’s opportunity to belatedly find some self-respect. To call out Trump’s rudeness towards her and tell him he had no business interfering in UK politics. To denounce Johnson as no more than the Donald’s slobbering lapdog. And yet both Corbyn and May remained almost entirely silent.Corbyn because he has not yet caught up with last Sunday’s newspapers, May because she has zero self-worth. She can’t defend herself because she believes there is nothing worthy of defence. Brexit has robbed her of every last shred of dignity: humiliated by her party, humiliated by the country and now humiliated by Trump.So instead of asking why taking back control has meant contracting out our foreign policy to the unstable orange narcissist in the White House, the Commons was treated to a third-rate discussion of just how burning the burning injustices really were. Something not without importance, but which could have have waited for another day. After all it wasn’t as if the burning injustices would have been extinguished by the following week. Or year. Or decade. Long before the two leaders had concluded their exchanges, all the Commons’ bars had sold out of laudanum.There was a rather more forensic examination of the Darroch leaks a few minutes later in a session of the foreign affairs select committee that had been hastily convened by its chair, Tom Tugendhat. In a voice that never rose above a gentle hush, Simon McDonald, the head of the diplomatic service, made it clear just how serious and unprecedented the situation was. He could think of no other time when a supposedly friendly government had refused to co-operate with a British ambassador and was certain there would be consequences.From time to time, Labour’s Chris Bryant and Ian Murray tried to broaden out the discussion into Boris Johnson’s role in precipitating Darroch’s resignation or the possible motives of those who had leaked the emails, but each time Tugendhat cut them short to focus on what had gone wrong and why.Priti Patel kept largely silent. She’s hoping for a major promotion when Boris becomes prime minister, but even devotees as fanatical as her are beginning to have misgivings about his judgment. Rather she restricted herself to saying she knew how difficult being an ambassador must be. Largely from her personal experience of freelance diplomacy to Israel that had resulted in her sacking as international development secretary in November 2017. Juggling two jobs in your free time was harder than it looked.“We will find a way through,” McDonald said sadly. Though first he would have to work out how the leak had occurred, which could prove tricky as it turned out that some of the Foreign Office systems were rather outdated. He couldn’t be entirely sure if the diplomatic telegrams had been hacked by the Russians or who among the 1,000 or so recipients had either printed out a hard copy or forwarded an email to someone who wanted to cause trouble for Darroch. He still hadn’t fully come to terms with a diptel having been leaked to the Sunday Times in 2016. When Tugendhat raised the matter, McDonald seemed genuinely surprised.But there would be a reckoning. The committee was certain of that. There was no public interest defence to the leaks and whoever was responsible was guilty of breaking the Official Secrets Act and would be banged up for six months. “Two years, I think,” Bryant corrected gleefully. Someone, somewhere was beginning to have second thoughts. Could they be sure their identity would be kept secret? That might be asking a lot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffc1a40bb6bb9ebd23cfbb5eaf6c8993e369ef95/243_148_6186_3712/master/6186.jpg?width=1300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e8b9e30d668f901be0eb15b67ee3a13 1300w","title":"dave brailsford team ineos cycling","story":"Dave Brailsford, the Team Ineos chief, has dismissed suggestions he may become group performance director across Jim Ratcliffe’s growing sports portfolio after the multimillionaire’s purchase of the French football club Nice.“My responsibility is running the cycling team,” Brailsford said, before acknowledging that “being part of an expanding sporting family is pretty exciting”.Team Ineos have a facility in Monaco and their highest-profile riders Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas are based on the Cote d’Azur.

It is time to salivate or fret or rejoice depending on your disposition. Despite all the ancient history England are favourites. Australia have played seven World Cup semi-finals and have not lost any they have lifted the trophy five times.No wonder they always seem pretty relaxed about the process though Aaron Finch surprised a few when he said he was planning to spend Wednesday afternoon watching The Queen’s Corgi. Somehow it’s hard to imagine Ian Chappell taking that option. Nor is there any record of Chappell leading a barefoot Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh around the Headingley outfield before the 1975 semi-final.England have not reached a World Cup semi-final since 1992. To put it mildly they have been useless in this tournament for the last 27 years. Now they sense the opportunity to create a bit of history. After those victories against India and New Zealand the confidence of the England players – and the bookmakers – seems to be restored.It is now a home game for Eoin Morgan’s side, which was unlikely to be the case a week ago. If India had been England’s opponents in Birmingham the stands would have been decorated with dark blue shirts and the roar greeting the fall of every England wicket would have been audible in Coventry. Now that Australia are the opponents English voices will predominate at a stadium which reverts to being the nearest we have to a cricketing Colosseum, especially when Australia are the opponents.Fervent crowd support for the home side is handy but it is not enough to deflect the resolve of Australia, who have delivered the goods with remarkable composure throughout the tournament. Their defeats have come against India in their third game and South Africa in their final one. Seven victories have helped to rid them of the notion they are the pariahs of the cricketing world they have played some excellent cricket without any unseemly incidents.Aaron Finch has proved himself a calm, civilised captain. Moreover we are now familiar with the return of David Warner and Steve Smith to international cricket. There will be some routine pantomime boos but they are used to that now. The enormity of the match will eventually take over.Australia managed to cruise through the qualifying process with their big players carrying the load. Warner and Finch have been prolific at the top of the order, while the wicketkeeper, Alex Carey, has been a revelation down the order. The others have not had much chance to excel– and as India may have discovered at Old Trafford – this can be a problem in a long tournament. The pace duo have morphed into a trio with the elevation of Jason Behrendorff, the lanky left-armer paceman, alongside the bankers, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc, who is the leading wicket-taker in the tournament. So despite the ease with which they have qualified the composition of their side is uncertain especially since they have lost Usman Khawaja and Shaun Marsh through injury.There have even been mumbles that they may consider omitting Glenn Maxwell, a rumour that stems from the feverish speculation that accompanies a big game rather than cricketing logic or anything said by the Australia camp. Finch has offered no suggestion they would dispense with Maxwell. Instead he has lauded his virtues. Naturally England would prefer Maxwell to be omitted, though they would never admit this, just in case it is his day.One certainty is Peter Handscomb will play even though he has just been drafted into the squad. One view is that this is “a big ask”. However the proper Australia response is surely that Handscomb’s situation is “fantastic”. He has missed trudging to each corner of the country over the last seven weeks before breezing into the team for the match that really matters. What an opportunity. However a few games for Australia A against weakened county sides may lack the intensity of a World Cup semi-final.England will probably play the side who have been victorious in their last two games, though Morgan said he would see how much grass had been removed from the pitch in the morning. If he sensed the ball may turn then Moeen Ali would be back in contention. The pitch at Edgbaston is in the middle of the square so that the hazard of one short boundary, which was the case when England played India here, has been diminished.The surface looked brown and reasonably hard on Wednesday. It has not been used before in the World Cup and the expectation from the captains was that there would be quite a few runs out there. The other expectation, which reflects a change of tack and conditions during the tournament is that the captain winning the toss will probably bat first. That has often been the Australia way in this format but England are recent converts. As was evident at Old Trafford on Wednesday chasing any total in a big game is a hazardous occupation.So what would Morgan say to his men on the eve of such a momentous match for the England team? He may not begin with: “There is a tide in the affairs of men. Which, taken at the floods, leads on to fortune.” In fact he said he would be very disappointed if they did anything different to what they routinely do before any other game. So he would not say anything different, either.Both captains gave the impression of calmness and professionalism before the game. But for Morgan in particular, after all the planning, this may be little more than an impression.He also has the problem of Starc, who dismissed him cheaply at Lord’s in a manner that prompted Kevin Pietersen to toss out the notion the England captain was “scared”. No doubt he would like to dispel that idea with some runs, especially against Starc.But the Pietersen observation is a pinprick compared to the England captain’s yearning to play one more game at the World Cup on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c768ced5745f3043ce55e23dd840dcc193d73fad/0_100_2921_1753/master/2921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f5c198e39c03c4b12ee2dd1622caf1b","title":"incredible comeback cricket world cup victory prompts outpouring of joy in new zealand","story":"Key runout against India described as ‘one of the most iconic sporting moments in New Zealand folklore’In the early hours of Thursday morning, New Zealanders collectively rubbed their tired eyes. On the other side of the world, something miraculous was happening. They could scarcely believe what they were seeing.In Manchester, on the second day of a Cricket World Cup semi-final that New Zealand were always meant to lose, the might of the Indian batting order was collapsing. It had come down to veteran MS Dhoni to carry the team to victory. He was India’s last hope.But in the 49th over, with 25 runs needed from 10 balls, Dhoni skied a ball to square leg. It was picked up by Martin Guptill, who until that point had endured a miserable tournament, producing just 94 runs with the bat.But in that moment, something clicked. Guptill picked up the ball and heaved it at the stumps, knocking the bails off with a direct hit. Dhoni’s bat was only inches away from being safe in the crease.Cue a collective, national outpouring of joy from every New Zealander who was still awake at 2am.“In that moment when he threw down the stumps, that is going to become one of the most iconic sporting moments in New Zealand folklore,” Alex Braae said on The Spinoff’s cricket podcast, The Offspin. “People are going to be talking about that runout until the heat death of the universe.”The rest of the Indian wickets fell easily to send New Zealand into the final for the second time in two tournaments.“You wouldn’t read about it,” said Mike Lane of Alternative Cricket Commentary. “What an incredible comeback from a team that farted their way through … now they are going to the home of cricket, Lords.”Everyone from sporting legends, to finance ministers and even former prime minister Helen Clark had words of support for the team.Breakfast television presenters brought sailors’ hats onto set, a reference to captain Kane “‘steady the ship” Williamson.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi was more philosophical. “Wins and losses are a part of life,” he wrote on Twitter.For Black Caps fans, losses have historically been a more prevalent part of their lives. Now, those ghosts will surface again, with memories of a similarly glorious entry to the previous final, which was soon followed by a lacklustre performance.Former Black Cap Grant Elliott, whose memorable six against South Africa took New Zealand to that final, urged them to go one better this time.Tired but energised New Zealand fans will have to wait until Sunday to see whether they can. If they do, and if Guptill scores a double century, Braae has vowed to get a tattoo of Guptill’s two-toed foot on his body in honour of the occasion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb61d8757467be7b409612a3e15d64f5d66a02b/0_46_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71284e5b3104dc0ae634efadb0081618","title":"talking horses masar can defy derby winners drought newmarket horse racing tips","story":"Masar has an excellent chance to end the poor record of recent Derby winners with victory in the Princess Of Wales’s Stakes at NewmarketThe last four winners of the Derby at Epsom have managed only a single victory between them in six subsequent starts, when Harzand followed up in the Irish equivalent in June 2016. Masar (3.35), though, has an excellent chance to end the three-year drought in the Princess Of Wales’s Stakes at Newmarket on Thursday.Masar was a busy juvenile, with five starts in three countries including a trip to the Breeders’ Cup at Del Mar, and maintained his work-rate in the first part of his three-year-old campaign, when he won the Derby on his fourth outing. But a leg injury then kept him off the track for 385 days, before his return at Royal Ascot last month when a bad stumble almost dislodged James Doyle just after the start.He still went on to finish fifth, less than five lengths behind the winner, Defoe, and Charlie Appleby, his trainer, expects to see significant improvement on Thursday.“He has definitely come forward for his run at Ascot,” Appleby said on Wednesday.”As we all know, he didn’t make the tidiest of starts and he was never in the position we would have liked to see him in.“He is moving well and his fitness is good. He is clear on ratings and if the Masar we are seeing at home turns up, then they all have him to beat. We feel this is a nice opportunity to get his head back in front and then hopefully afterwards we can start looking at an autumn campaign.”Masar is odds-against at 5-4 to regain the winning thread, with Mirage Dancer, last year’s runner-up, rated the main danger at 5-2. Sir Michael Stoute’s five-year-old is a solid performer at this level but it will be a disappointment for many if he is good enough to overcome Masar.Newmarket 1.50 Danny Tudhope starts the July Festival meeting as the narrow leader in the race for the Flat jockeys’ championship and while his challenge has its roots on the northern circuit, some of Newmarket’s big names have also been chipping in with winners to keep him in the hunt. Eagles By Day is his only winner so far in nine rides for Michael Bell this year, but Tudhope has an obvious chance to make it two-from-10 on the son of Sea The Stars in the Group Three Bahrain Trophy when the step up in trip should suit after their solid run into third behind Japan in a Group Two at Royal Ascot. Aidan O’Brien’s Barbados, dropping back slightly in trip after finishing a close second in the Queen’s Vase at Royal Ascot, is the obvious danger.Newmarket 2.25 Several subsequent Group One winners have gone to post for the July Stakes in recent seasons, though not all have returned as winners. US Navy Flag was only second in 2017, while Jungle Cat and Muhaarar, who won a combined six races at the highest level later on in their careers, were only second and third in 2014. Advertise, the recent Commonwealth Cup winner, and Shalaa were both successful on the July course, however, and Visinari could well emulate them on the way to even better things.. His debut win over track and trip in early June was exceptional both in terms of the winning distance and time, and the form leaves him with little to find to give Mark Johnston a second July Stakes in three seasons.Newmarket 3.00 A maximum field of 20 will go into the stalls for one of the most competitive three-year-old sprint handicaps of the season, but despite the numbers, this is a race where the market leaders tend to come to the fore, with five of the last six winners going off at a single-figure price. Aplomb and Magical Wish both arrive with strong claims and the former won with something to spare at Nottingham last time. He has yet to race on ground as fast as today’s, however, and at the prices, Moss Gill makes slightly more appeal. He too had something in hand when successful at Ripon last time out and can overcome a 6lb rise in the weights stepping back up to six furlongs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca2aaefeaa32e528c3af25796d8d44fed1af64d/1741_1104_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63508fbf87c4f8b900c8257dc923fbed","title":"me and my dad inspiration indifference and pride","story":"Absurdist, dogged, overtly Scottish ... our fathers come in many flavours. Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27610f22d18902a129af83a974cbefd9db47af11/0_168_5034_3020/master/5034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd83fed6cf398ca36737e48a3b28e1e","title":"angela merkel seen shaking for third time","story":"German chancellor began trembling at reception for Finnish prime ministerAngela Merkel has insisted she is in good health after experiencing a third bout of shaking in as many weeks at a public event in Berlin.The German chancellor was seen trembling during military honours for Finland’s prime minister, Antti Rinne, in the forecourt of her chancellery on Wednesday morning.The bout of shaking was said to be less intense than in the previous two instances, and stopped when Merkel moved her body.“I am doing fine and you should not worry,” she said in a press conference after the meeting, adding that she was going through a phase of psychologically “processing” her first shaking episode last month.Merkel’s public bouts of shaking have fuelled speculation about her health. On 18 June, she was seen involuntarily shaking during military honours for the visiting Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. She later appeared to blame dehydration, saying she felt better after drinking some water.She was seen going through a similar bout just a week later, during an appointment with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at Bellevue Palace in Berlin.Citing sources in government circles, the newspaper Stuttgarter Nachrichten said at the time that Merkel’s trembling had been triggered by the memory of the previous shaking bout, calling it a “psychological process”.“I have already said that I am going through a phase of processing the recent military honours with President Zelenskiy,” the chancellor said on Wednesday. “This appears not to be quite finished yet, but I am making progress and will have to live with it for a while.”She was also seen shaking during military honours in humid conditions in Mexico City on a visit in 2017.The 64-year-old’s work ethic and stamina during late-night negotiations has become the stuff of legend since she became chancellor in 2005. She once prided herself on having a “camel-like” capacity to store up sleep.Partially as a result of this reputation, the three televised instances of shaking have fuelled speculation about whether her intense schedule is beginning to take its toll.While coverage of the first shaking bout in German media was initially restrained, newspaper columns have since been filled with medical experts speculating about the cause.The German Green party co-leader Annalena Baerbock had suggested Merkel’s shaking episodes could be connected to the climate crisis, saying at a press conference that “regarding the hot temperatures, we can see from the chancellor it is clear that this summer climate has health consequences”. She later apologised for her comments.“There is little information available beyond what has been stated by Angela Merkel, so it’s impossible to know what might be the cause,” said Peter Roberts, emeritus professor of pharmacology at the University of Bristol.“An initial effect caused by dehydration, followed by anxiety that it may occur again, might even be the cause. The stress response is a basic survival mechanism and kicks in as soon as a threat is perceived, including fear that something may happen”.In the absence of any underlying pathology, Roberts said uncontrollable shaking could be the result of a normal stress response. “The problem with the response is that our bodies behave in this way in response to both real and feared threats. Indeed, the fear that your body is going to start behaving in a seemingly abnormal way may precipitate that very response.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71a121cb0d4f9d40c4ae290ffd53e5293dd36c45/0_144_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c94ecd4ed893301d23b7cf61b7d26068","title":"hes the daddy judge rules on two year julio iglesias paternity case","story":"Former ballerina said her son, now 42, was conceived in week-long affair with the pop starA Spanish court has ruled that the pop star Julio Iglesias is the biological father of a 42-year-old man whose mother said she had a brief affair with the singer in the 1970s.In a case that has dragged on for two years, a judge in Valencia ruled that Javier Sánchez Santos, who now lives in Italy, is the Spanish singer’s son despite Iglesias repeatedly refusing to give a DNA sample.The judge’s decision was based on the testimony of María Edite, a former ballerina, who said she had a one-week affair with Iglesias in Sant Feliu de Guíxols on the Costa Brava in 1975 and that Santos was born as a result of that relationship.The case had already been dismissed in 1992 but Santos’s lawyer, Fernando Osuna, insisted DNA evidence procured by a detective in the US was cause for the case to be reopened.The detective managed to get hold of a water bottle that the singer’s son Julio Iglesias Jr was drinking from when he was surfing in Miami. Osuna claimed DNA testing showed that Santos and Iglesias Jr were brothers.The judge refused to admit the DNA as evidence but in his ruling stated that “there is a clear physical resemblance between father and son” as well as the evidence that “at the time of conception there was a certain amount of contact between María Edite Santos and Julio Iglesias during which time it is not implausible that they had a sexual relationship”.Iglesias, 75, who was not in court, has consistently denied he is the father and his lawyers say he will appeal against the decision.The Grammy-winning singer, who has sold more than 300m albums over a long career, is probably Spain’s biggest international star and sang at the White House at Ronald Reagan’s Christmas party in 1983.However, his love life has won him as much publicity as his music, and he has been keeping Spain’s sensationalist “pink press” in copy for decades. Santos aside, he has eight children, three from his relationship with Isabel Preysler, whom he married in 1971, and five more with his second wife, Miranda Rijnsburger.Before the ruling, Preysler, who was Iglesias’s wife at the time of the alleged affair, said she believed that if it was proven that Santos was his son, Iglesias would “do his duty as a father because Julio has always been a very responsible person”.Enrique, the third son of Preysler and Iglesias, is also a successful singer who has won five Latin Grammys."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b664e3a8d7929ee03542af9a86c08fa777b6f6d4/1378_811_2585_1551/master/2585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=014c44d7110a335690dc1ec1d2fec6ca","title":"ursula von der leyen signals not reopen brexit talks backstop","story":"Nominee to lead European commission also says ‘precious’ backstop must be defendedUrsula von der Leyen, the nominee to lead the European commission, has signalled she will not reopen Brexit talks with the next British prime minister and stressed the “precious” Irish backstop must be defended.She said she still hoped the UK would remain in the European Union, while indicating she had no intention to renegotiate the withdrawal deal agreed by Theresa May and EU leaders.“I think it’s a good deal, but it is your responsibility and your noble task to sort this out,” she told a British Liberal Democrat MEP in the European parliament, in her first public comments on Brexit.In a thinly veiled message to the Tory leadership candidates Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson, Von der Leyen said the tone and attitude with which Brexit happens were crucial, adding: “Brexit is not the end of something, Brexit is the beginning of future relations and it’s of absolute importance that we have good cooperation.”She also made it clear she opposed attempts by both men to reopen discussions on the backstop, the fallback plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.“I think the backstop is of utmost importance and we absolutely know how crucial this nonexistent border is for you,” she said in response to an Irish MEP. “Having the backstop in the Brexit deal is precious, important and has to be defended.”Von der Leyen was addressing the European parliament’s liberal group as part of a round of meetings with large political groups to rally support ahead of a vote on her appointment next week. After being backed by EU leaders Von der Leyen needs at least 376 MEPs to elect her as commission president.The current German defence minister is a member of the centre-right European People’s party (EPP), so needs to win over some combination of socialists, liberals, greens or Eurosceptics.Von der Leyen, who would be the first woman to lead the EU executive, said she wanted an equal share of men and women as European commissioners. However, this depends on the EU’s member states appointing women to be their commissioners – an appeal many ignored in 2014.Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European commission takes office.Making her pitch to MEPs, Von der Leyen emphasised her green credentials while also arguing that the EU needed to be more assertive in the world – a traditional preoccupation of the centrist group. Her earlier meetings with the EPP, Eurosceptic group and socialists were not broadcast online.She pledged her full commitment to making the bloc climate neutral by 2050, saying this required tougher targets for 2030 as well as EU funds for countries that would otherwise struggle to make the green transition.Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary recently blocked an EU declaration for a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050, and are angling for more money before signing up to any pledge.Speaking in a mix of English, French and German, Von der Leyen emphasised her European outlook, reminding MEPs she was born in Brussels and attended the city’s European school with Dutch, German and French classmates. “That was my first impression of Europe,” she said.She clarified her views on European defence, restating that national parliaments should continue to have the final say on sending men and women into dangerous situations. “I prefer to speak about the army of the Europeans, not the European army,” she said, citing as a model the existing cooperation between Dutch and German forces.Although it is expected Von der Leyen will be approved by the European parliament, she still faced sniping over the process of her appointment whereby she leapfrogged politicians who had declared bids to lead the commission before European elections.The Dutch MEP Sophie in ‘t Veld asked whether she would be tougher in acting against violations of the rule of law and democracy than the outgoing commission, adding it was “remarkable” that Poland and Hungary had supported Von der Leyen’s nomination.Von der Leyen answered “yes” and pointed out her appointment was backed by all countries, although Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, did not vote for her because of isions in Germany’s ruling coalition.In her opening remarks Von der Leyen said the rule of law was “the jewel in the crown of our work” and that the EU needed a mechanism for upholding it in member states."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1187f97354d992e4aa3df6bcb8567e8cf822b0d7/0_381_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31ef88bda57da092e6997c44ad9aa2d4","title":"iranian boats harass british oil tanker in strait of hormuz","story":"UK government spokesman says three Iranian boats were warned off by HMS Montrose, but Tehran denies involvementThree Iranian boats have “attempted to impede” a British oil tanker in the Gulf on Wednesday, further deepening tensions in the vital shipping channel off Iran.The incident took place in the strait of Hormuz through which the commercial vessel, British Heritage, was attempting to pass.“Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the strait of Hormuz,” a UK government statement released on Thursday morning said.The British warship, HMS Montrose was “forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away,” the statement said.“We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.”Iran’s Revolutionary Guards rejected the claim that they tried to stop the British tanker, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.US defence officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, had earlier told Reuters that the incident happened at the northern entrance of the strait of Hormuz.“The Royal Navy HMS Montrose, which was also there, pointed it(s) guns at the boats and warned them over radio, at which point they dispersed,” one of the officials said.“It was harassment and an attempt to interfere with the passage,” another official said.A spokesman for US central command, Captain Bill Urban, said: “We are aware of the reports of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp Navy’s FACFIAC harassment and attempts to interfere with the passage of the UK-flagged merchant vessel British Heritage today near the strait of Hormuz.”“Threats to international freedom of navigation require aninternational solution.”CNN reported that a US surveillance aircraft recorded video of the incident. It said the HMS Montrose, which was escorting the oil tanker, trained its guns on the IRG boats and issued a verbal warning.On Wednesday Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, warned the UK it would face unspecified consequences as a result of the UK’s seizure of an oil tanker bound for Syria off the coast of Gibraltar last week. The ship remains in British possession.Rouhani was quoted by the Iranian official IRNA news agency calling the seizure of the Iranian oil ship “mean and wrong”.

Despite the fact she could no longer be heard by the crowd, some of whom were jeering, Funganitao yelled: “I am not done!” and continued speaking, as her mother and brother joined her onstage.“Enough is enough and I will not tolerate any more fakeness!” she said. “If you have the guts to attack a person as a group in such a cowardly way, then you can deal with the consequences when she shares her experience with the entire world!”A statement released on behalf of Tonga Tourism Association said it was “regretful” that Funganitao “chose to publicly air concerns harboured over the past year”.The fiery scene was not the only moment of drama of the night. The special guest at the event, Leoshina Mercy Kariha, who won the Miss South Pacific pageant in December, was reported to be the subject of a racist attack yelled from the crowd during her keynote speech.While Kariha, who comes from Papua New Guinea, was speaking, a member of the crowd reportedly yelled that she was “black, ugly and disgusting”.In a statement after the event, Kariha confirmed that “a comment by one inidual in the VIP area was made – and that is something that is never nice to hear.” But she said that since her arrival in Tonga she had been treated “with so much dignity and respect”.In a statement, the festival and Tonga Tourism Association said: “The audience’s alleged bullying and racist reaction to the speech from Miss Pacific Islands, as well as to that of the former Miss Heilala is deeply regretted”, adding they “did not condone any form of bullying or racism and takes this allegation very seriously.”Women’s rights leaders from across the Pacific said a rethink of the entire pageant industry was needed.Ali said the pageants encouraged the objectification of women and there were other platforms that could encourage female empowerment that did not involve women competing with one another on their beauty.“And then the whole idea of beauty, it’s the western idea of beauty,” she said. “You don’t get Pacific women who have big bottoms and big breasts and are a different colour. Usually the preferred is the fairer woman with the slim body and straighter hair and made up to the nines, it’s really not the Pacific idea.”Betty Blake, director of the NGO Ma’a Fafine Moe Famili Tonga, said the beauty pageant had “had its day”.“It’s gone out of date, we shouldn’t do that any more ... To me, as a gender advocate I believe it’s not fair, it doesn’t treat our girls properly and give them the dignity and the respect,” she said. “If you look at it, it’s almost like the program is exploiting young girls, but in a manner that might be looked at as OK.”Both Blake and Ali said there were huge issues facing women in Pacific nations, which have some of the highest rates of domestic violence in the world, that should be the focus of gendered activities, rather than pageants.“There are more important issues,” Ali said. “The time is up for this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60df66ddbba8e3ab4ecd0c548e0b2e7c83dc4f4c/0_338_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f910274e7acdd9535565c50f1fb8fc7","title":"uk secularism on rise as more than half say they have no religion","story":"The growth of secularism in the UK is unabated with fresh data showing stark generational differences and a new confidence among the non-religious to declare themselves atheist.Across all age groups, the younger people are the less likely they are to call themselves Anglican.The steady decline in religious belief among the British public is “one of the most important trends in postwar history”, says the BSA report.“Britain is becoming more secular not because adults are losing their religion but because older people with an attachment to the C of E and other Christian denominations are gradually being replaced in the population by younger unaffiliated people,” says the report.“To put it another way, religious decline in Britain is generational people tend to be less religious than their parents, and on average their children are even less religious than they are.”Non-religious parents successfully transmit their lack of faith to their children, but two religious parents have only a 5050 chance of passing on their faith, the report says.The non-religious are increasingly atheist. One in four members of the public stated: “I do not believe in God,” compared with one in 10 in 1998. The figures challenge theories that people are “believing but not belonging” – in other words, that faith has become private rather than institutional – the report says.Nevertheless, most people are tolerant of others’ religious beliefs. A large majority of both non-believers and people of faith have positive or neutral views of iniduals who belong to a religion."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3952817.1562793134!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"five varieties of irish tree in running to be deemed ireland s best","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWitches Yew tree, Blarney Castle, Co Cork: Legend has it that a witch, who first told mortals of the Blarney stone’s power, is imprisoned in the stone at the base of the Witches Yew. Five varieties of Irish tree are in the running to be deemed Ireland’s best as part of a Europe-wide competition.The Tree Council of Ireland which is an education and advocacy group has selected five finalists in four counties, Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Cork.Online voting begins this week and the public will be asked to chose between five of Ireland’s most famous and beautiful trees.The winner will go on to be judged in the 2020 European tree of the year competition.Ireland’s five finalists are: the mighty Oak at the Battle of the Boyne site in Oldbridge, Co Meath the Arbour Hill Sycamore in Dublin city behind Collins Barracks the Sycamore on the Farmleigh Estate within the Phoenix Park a sweet chestnut tree at Castletown Estate in Celbridge, Co Kildare and the Witches Yew at Blarney Castle in Co Cork.The contest was started in the Czech Republic in 2011 and its purpose is to highlight trees that contribute to national and cultural heritage. Ireland has not had an entry since 2017 when Just Forests, the charity that previously managed the event here, was wound down.A 135-year-old Hungarian almond tree was named 2019 winner in Brussels earlier this year. An Irish tree has never been selected as winner.Joe McConville, president of the tree council, said the contest highlighted Ireland’s “champion and veteran trees” as some of the finalists are up to 600 years old. He said planting more trees was an important part of climate-change mitigation, but it was equally vital to recognise trees with which people had a personal connection.“You can get behind your local tree or you can rally for one you really believe in like you would a football team,” he said.Mr McConville said he thought Ireland “had a really good chance of winning”. Also hopeful is head gardener at Blarney Castle Adam Whitbourn who said the Witches Yew tree had a mystical history to it. Legend has it that a witch, who first told mortals of the Blarney stone’s power, is imprisoned in the stone at the base of the tree.“You can feel the centuries of history unfolding around you when you visit this tree,” said Mr Whitbourn. “That’s what this competition is all about. We are only temporary custodians of these trees and their lives last much longer than our own.”Voting for the 2020 entry will be live on Friday at treeoftheyear.ie or via a link on the tree council’s website.Ireland’s previous entries included a selection of pines and evergreen cypress trees in Co Kerry, known as Hugh O’Flaherty Trees. Another entry was the Generation Tree, a beech in Co Tipperary with the initials of 12 grandchildren from a single family."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3952995.1562790889!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one way system proposed for inchicore to save trees","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tInchicore residents (from left) Lauren Tuite, baby Margot, Gerard Greene, Annie Dibble, Christine Kavanagh and Elizabeth Burns on Grattan Crescent. They are among a number of local objectors to the felling of  trees on the road. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillThe National Transport Authority (NTA) is proposing to limit cars in part of Inchicore following a request from locals for a one-way system in the south Dublin suburb to save trees.More than 70 residents from Inchicore wrote to the authority earlier this year in relation to the BusConnects proposals, stating that saving trees at Grattan Crescent was their “number one priority” and proposed a one-way system for private motorists on the road “as a compromise”.Under the NTA’s proposed Liffey Valley to city centre corridor, some of the trees on Grattan Crescent would have to be removed to accommodate an additional bus lane.A number of residents and local Green party councillor Michael Pidgeon met the NTA on Tuesday night to see the latest draft plans for the area under the BusConnects project.Lauren Tuite, a resident who attended the meeting, said the plans presented included a one-way system for private vehicles on Grattan Crescent.“There’s a one-way system from Kilmainham Gaol right to Inchicore currently, so it would just continue that one-way system, which is what we had proposed,” she said.Ms Tuite said the majority of residents present were “excited” by the plans, with a small number advocating to keep a two-way system for private vehicles. She said the plans also set out for more seating outside Inchicore National School, the planting of trees and additional footpath space.The NTA said draft plans are being developed based on initial concept designs and submissions received under public consultation, which closed at the end of May.“We agreed to keep a dialogue open with local resident groups across many of the corridors during the design process as we are listening. So at present there is a draft one-way system in that area and a second round of public consultation will commence in the autumn and the detailed designs will be available then for further submissions,” an NTA spokeswoman said.“We are meeting more groups in the coming weeks and as already stated where there are feasible, realistic and workable solutions to minimise the impact on trees including one-way systems and removal of on-street parking these are all being considered once we achieve dedicated bus lanes and cycle lanes.”Mr Pidgeon described residents’ engagement with the plans as “forward thinking”.“Residents had worked out an alternative and were willing to make a compromise and saw the benefits of those improvements in the long-run.“I think the fact that they didn’t go in necessarily just opposed, they went in with suggestions and alternatives which was really welcomed.”BusConnects aims to overhaul the bus system in the Dublin region by creating 230km of dedicated bus lanes and 200km of cycle tracks along 16 of the busiest corridors and a redesign of the network.More than 1,400 properties stand to lose part of their front gardens to accommodate the plans, while more than 1,600 trees and 700 parking spaces would be lost.A revised redesign and updated corridor plans are due to be published in the autumn and further rounds of public consultation are planned."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3952748.1562781145!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why do orangemen march the twelfth of july explained","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA 12th of July parade through Tandragee. Photograph: Frank MillerThe . It is the annual Ulster Protestant celebration - held every year on July 12th - in religiously ided Northern Ireland that commemorates a 329-year-old military victory when the last British Catholic monarch King James II was defeated by Protestant King William, formerly Prince of Orange in Holland, at the Battle of the Boyne.How is it celebrated?Each year, members of the Orange Order - named after the victorious king and founded in 1795 - carry banners and flags in parades across Northern Ireland accompanied by marching bands carrying musical instruments that include pipes and drums. Orangemen wear distinctive bowler hats, white gloves and orange collarettes. The order, a “fraternal” organisation, has 35,000 to 40,000 members, including an estimated 2,000 in the Republic. The annual commemoration starts with bonfires and fireworks on the night of the Eleventh.What are they celebrating?They are commemorating the Glorious Revolution, or Revolution of 1688, that granted Protestant groups freedom of worship when King William and Queen Mary, James II’s daughter, seized the British throne of the Catholic king. The new king established a parliamentary democracy, representing a shift from an absolute monarchy to parliamentary monarchy. A Bill of Rights passed by the 1689 parliament declared that no future monarch could be a Catholic or be married to a Catholic. On the Twelfth, Ulster Protestants are celebrating “King Billy” as the champion of the Protestant faith who secured the subsequent Protestant ascendancy - the political, economic and social domination by the minority Protestant population for three centuries - in Ireland. The defeated King James’s claims to the throne ended with the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690.Why is it contentious?It is viewed by the predominantly Catholic nationalist community in Northern Ireland as a provocative display of triumphalism.Why are bonfires built and lit on the Eleventh Night?Bonfires were lit, the Orange Order says, across Ulster “from hilltop to hilltop” in celebration when news of William and Mary’s coronation reached Ireland and to guide the king and his 15,000 troops as they landed in Carrickfergus and marched in to Belfast in June 1690. The commemorative “Eleventh Night” bonfires are also said to represent the camp fires of the king’s troops the night before the Battle of the Boyne.What happened at Drumcree?The Drumcree Orange parade has been the most contentious in modern times. A standoff began in the mid-1990s after police stopped an annual Orange parade in Portadown, Co Armagh passing down the mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road on their annual march from Drumcree church. Attempts to ban the march from going down the road before 1998 led to Loyalist rioting in Portadown and across Northern Ireland in July of that year. The parade has been banned from passing down the road since then. There was Republican rioting when Orangemen were permitted by the UK government to march down the road in 1997.What happens to contentious Orange parades now?The Parades Commission, the “quasi-judicial non-departmental public body” born out of the Drumcree dispute, decides whether restrictions should be applied on contentious marches and has the power to ban parades outright. It accepts submissions and encourages dialogue between marchers and residents.In its most recent annual report, for the year to the end of March 2018, the commission received notifications of 4,499 parades and parade-related protests, including 2,435 ProtestantUnionistLoyalist parades and 126 CatholicRepublicanNationalist parades. Some 190 of the 4,499 were considered sensitive, including 178 ProtestantUnionistLoyalist parades. It imposed conditions on 166 ProtestantUnionistLoyalist parades and eight CatholicRepublicanNationalist parades during the year.The commission said in the 2018 report “the Drumcree dispute remains unresolved” - more than two decades after it brought Northern Ireland to a standstill.“Although the weekly protest parade has limited impact on community life, the Drumcree dispute continues to cause resentment,” said the commission."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"President Hassan Rouhani says British operation was \u0026lsquovery cheap, wrong and a mistake\u0026rsquoUS will provide intelligence to coalition partners\u0026rsquo ships patrolling vulnerable waterwaysUS special envoy to Afghanistan winds up seventh round of talks amid signs of progressEmirati troops to leave Hodeidah port amid disagreement with Saudis over devastating warHuman Rights Watch calls on Baghdad to ensure humane treatment of detaineesEuropean powers express concern at move, although Tehran says position is \u0026lsquoreversible\u0026rsquoMove could eventually culminate in the return of all international sanctions on TehranEconomic crises in all three countries, plus chronic shortfalls in donor funding, are fuelling resentment among citizens with increased pressure on Syrians to leaveKilling of Solomon Tekah (18) by off-duty police officer sparks rallies across countryRefugees and migrants call for evacuation after at least 40 killed in Tripoli attackRuler of Dubai and wife engaged in London high court disputePrincess who invited Mary Robinson to Dubai in aftermath of Latifa case flees UAEUnited States has increased military presence in regionMiddle Eastern royals had previously been in the spotlight over fate of Princess LatifaMove defies European warning to stick to terms of 2015 agreement despite US sanctionsYoung men\u0026rsquos right to skip army for yeshiva religious schools at risk as elections loomIsrael threatens to reinstate sanctions if commitments are not fulfilledUS sanctions inflaming tensions without punishing those responsible, say expertsUS president insists he does not \u0026lsquoneed exit strategies\u0026rsquo when asked about risk of Iran warTens of thousands have driving licences but activists are detained and laws still restrictive"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3953577.1562823519!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"iranian boats attempt to impede british commerical vessel","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Royal Navy’s  HMS Montrose is pictured at speed in the Mediterranean Sea during an excercise in 2012.

It is part of a drive by the Department for Education to address the rise in students who report mental health issues during their time at university.Data released earlier this year showed that the number of students declaring mental health problems on arrival at university has surged.Figures obtained via freedom of information requests showed a 73 per cent rise between 2014-15 and 2017-18 in students stating that they had a condition such as depression or anxiety before starting their courses.Inexperienced prison staff blamed for culture of drugs and violence at new £250m jailProgress in getting poor children into university twice as fast in England than Scotland, Tories sayWho will replace Sir Kim Darroch?

Meanwhile, applications from Northern Ireland are down by 4 per cent, from 19,310 to 18,520.There is huge demand among the growing Chinese middle class for their children to have an English education, while British institutions are rushing to cash in on the higher, international student tuition fees they bring in.Under EU laws, universities must charge European students the same level of fees as their British peers, but non-EU students can be charged at a higher rate. David Palfreyman, director of the Oxford Centre for Higher Education Policy Studies, said:  “The growth in Chinese students is a phenomenon that links to the growth of the middle class and more being able to send their children abroad to be educated.“Secondly it wobbles depending on whether Trump has put off Chinese students from applying to American universities”.  A study published earlier this year found that a trade war with the US is driving Chinese students to Britain.A fifth (20 per cent) of Chinese students chose the UK as their first choice destination, while 17 per cent opted for America, according to a report by EIC Education, a Chinese education consultancy.The Trump administration has tightened visa requirements for Chinese students, especially those studying science and technology, amid mounting concerns about espionage.Mr Palfreyman said that the reduction in the value of the pound since 2016 is another factor, as it has made British universities seem relatively cheaper for overseas students compared to elsewhere.In total, a record 81, 340 students from outside the EU applied to study in the UK this year, an increase of eight per cent on last year.The volume of international students rose far more steeply than that of EU students, which has increased by one per cent since 2018.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, warned that universities must not become too financially dependent on the fees from overseas students.  “It does mean a chunky source of university income is very sensitive to the strength of the political relationship between China and the UK at any given point,” he said.  If we hadn’t, completely stupidly, given up our strong position as a recruiter of Indian students, we would have achieved a better balance.”The figures showed that there although there has been demographic dip in the population of 18-year-olds in the UK in recent years, the proportion of school leavers applying to university has increased from 38.1 per cent last year to 39. 5 per cent in 2019.Chris Skidmore, the universities minister, said: “International students bring huge cultural and economic benefits to the UK. These figures show we are making good progress in our ambition to open up world-leading higher education to anyone who has the potential to benefit from it and I’m confident that we can go even further.”Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: “The global appeal of UK higher education has never been clearer, with record, demographic beating application rates in England and Wales, and the steep rise in international applications, especially from China.Inexperienced prison staff blamed for culture of drugs and violence at new £250m jailProgress in getting poor children into university twice as fast in England than Scotland, Tories sayWho will replace Sir Kim Darroch?

A US aircraft flying overhead filmed the incident, the broadcaster said.The Guards boats withdrew after HMS Montrose, a Royal Navy frigate which had been escorting the tanker, aimed its guns on the Iranians and warned them to move away, according to CNN.It was harassment and an attempt to interfere with the passage, a US official told Reuters.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz.“HMS Montrose was forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away.“We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.”Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards rejected the claim that they tried to stop the British tanker, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Thursday.It was reported earlier that HMS Montrose, a Type-23 frigate, was in the region to safeguard  another British oil tanker in the region, the Pacific Voyager.Tensions have escalated between the UK and Iran over the Royal Marines’ seizure of an Iranian oil tanker in Gibraltar last Thursday. The Islamic Republic has warned there will be a response to the seizure of the Grace 1, with President Hassan Rouhani saying on Wednesday that Britain “will realise the consequences later.”Mr Rouhani called the seizure of the vessel, which was bound for Syria and accused of flouting EU sanctions, mean and wrong during a Cabinet meeting.He warned London: You are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions, without elaborating.An Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander threatened on Friday to seize a British ship in retaliation.Oil supertanker Grace 1 operation in waters off British overseas territory of GibraltarIran denies the vessel was headed to Banyas refinery in Syria, where the government of President Bashar al-Assad is an ally of Tehran.The Pacific Voyager, an Isle of Man-flagged oil tanker, and the British Heritage had been sheltering off the coast of Saudi Arabia this week amid fears they would be seized in retaliation.The British Heritage was due to dock in the Iraqi city of Basra on the weekend but made an unexpected U-turn.The British-flagged ship, able to hold more than one million barrels of oil, was contracted by Royal Dutch Shell to collect the crude and deliver it to northwest Europe but the order was cancelled.The latest reported incident comes after Iran said it had lost patience with perceived inaction by European countries more than a year after US President Donald Trump withdrew the US out of a 2015 agreement curbing Tehran\u0027s nuclear programme.Washington has since stepped up economic sanctions against Iran and moved to bring the country\u0027s oil exports to zero as part of a maximum pressure policy to make Iran halt actions that it said undermined regional security.Iran has responded to the sanctions by starting to breach limits put on its nuclear activities under the 2015 pact.Several oil tankers were attacked in waters near Iran\u0027s southern coast in May and June, for which the United States blamed Iran. Tehran denied any involvement.Last month, Iran shot down a US drone near the Strait of Hormuz, prompting Mr Trump to order retaliatory air strikes, only to call them off.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

I think that it would have gone down differently.”After her role in American Pie, Elizabeth went on to star in the film’s sequels, as well as Scary Movie, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Love Actually.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Bitcoin is once again starting to be viewed as a currency with the potential to bring real and radical change to the world rather than purely as an asset, which can rapidly burn out.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic.

Firing people is expensive and disruptive so companies only move when they have to, when\u0026nbspthings have clearly entered a downward\u0026nbspspiral.But recruitment behaves a little differently. One way employers respond if they see troubles ahead is by delaying it. They put off making decisions and let things ride until they have a clearer idea of the outlook. If that’s what is starting to happen, the results of companies like Michael Page are where you’ll see it first. \u0026nbspOn the face of it, the latest set of numbers look rather good. The company touted a record quarter with 16 countries growing by 10 per cent or more. Despite this, the share price resembled the final part of a rollercoaster on its\u0026nbsprelease, the sharp e just before everyone gets off and reaches for the sick bag (in the case of the parents).\u0026nbspTough crowd? Not really. The market is less interested in Michael Page’s successful past than it is in what’s coming. The company was punished because it warned that its profits will likely be at the lower end of the market’s expectations as a result of “the current macroeconomic conditions”.\u0026nbspIn English, Michael\u0026nbspPage\u0026nbspis telling us that it’s worried about the global economy slowing and hitting hiring. The signs of that were all over the trading statement.\u0026nbspThe economy is a small boat tossed by the waves of political madnessThe £183m British Airways fine is a game-changer for consumersOcado’s tech gobbledygook has investors in a tizzy Having added more than 600 fee-earners in the first quarter of the year, its\u0026nbspnumbers fell by 122 in the second. Growth in gross profits from temporary hires was much faster than that from permanent placements. If you’re worried about the future but you have a gap, it makes sense to fill it with a\u0026nbsptemp, particularly in places where firing is difficult and expensive (such as France).For those of us living in the Brexit-battered UK, the situation looks worse. This country is the only one of the markets that Michael\u0026nbspPage breaks out to show a decline in gross profits.\u0026nbspIts numbers don’t give a picture of the entire UK labour force, but they still don’t bode at all well for the future. They chime with the Employment Index put out by business adviser BDO at the start of the week. It fell to its lowest level in a year, moving partner Peter Hemington to opine that “the glory years of rising UK employment figures could be coming to an end”.\u0026nbspSo that canary? It’s starting to struggle for breath as the global economy catches a chill. But in Britain it’s on the floor of its cage, gasping.\u0026nbspWe’re just starting to feel\u0026nbspthe whirlwind of the Brexiteers’ folly. Boris Johnson banging on about optimism and believing in Britain won’t come as much comfort if the hiring delays, or even recruitment freezes, Brexit is causing start to turn into widespread redundancy programmes.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They succeeded by offering a lot of value to consumers first and foremost, but also to marketers.Before them, if a firm wanted a consumer to read (F) something, buy (A) something, install (A) something, watch (N) something, or search (G) for something, there were not many other options.But thanks to a new generation of companies, marketers are about to have a lot more options.\u0026nbspPrediction #1: Every company that has a direct relationship with users and access to data will eventually get into advertising.When you reach consumers and you have access to data, you’ll eventually realise the value in monetising that audience beyond your core product – with ads.Advertising is a $600bn-plus-a-year business, and the “marketing market” is even greater than that as it includes all the activities necessary to bring a product or service all the way to the consumer. So a piece of it, even if it’s a small one, is too tempting to pass up.\u0026nbspTake Amazon as an example. It expanded into advertising only around three years ago and has since become the third-largest advertising company in the US, with $18bn in revenue from the business stream. Even Apple, which for all intents and purposes is not an advertising company, is expected to generate $2bn in search ads in the app store by 2020. \u0026nbspThe only reason a company would choose not to enter the advertising business is if it doesn’t reach enough consumers or if it doesn’t have its own data.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.126 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

E-commerce companies like Wayfair and Boxed built alternative marketplaces for groups of like-minded customers. Brands such as mattress maker Casper or Dollar Shave Club pioneered new subscription models based around brand story and community, disrupting Sleepy’s and P\u0026ampG’s Gillette, respectively. These companies’ most valuable asset is always their customer relationships (and data) whether they stay private, go public or get acquired.\u0026nbspThis new generation of post-FAANG-era companies is here to stay.\u0026nbspRising stars like Pinterest and Airbnb will continue to thrive, creating new user-friendly online spaces that are compelling in their own right. Activity on these owned-and-operated mobile apps and websites generates hugely valuable troves of first-party data, which can then be used to improve user experience, strengthen customer relationships and convert users into advocates. This virtuous cycle offers a more sustainable and differentiated growth strategy for the rising generation of consumer brands.And in the end, everybody will tap into the advertising market, offering various businesses the option to be promoted natively within their environment.\u0026nbspLast prediction: I’m optimistic about the future of advertisers, and this trajectory is great for consumers.\u0026nbspThese new and emerging companies are evidence that a new era has arrived. While no one can afford to wean themselves entirely off any single major platform, the recent IPOs and those still to come prove there is a huge wave of new companies that will give advertisers more choice.\u0026nbspBoth established and emerging brands will continue to advertise across FAANG, but with more advertising channels in their arsenal. I’m optimistic as there will be less concentration, more value for money and more access to the data advertisers need to succeed.\u0026nbspThis is particularly great for consumers because if advertisers have choices outside of FAANG, their advertising costs will decrease and their product prices won’t have to increase in response.\u0026nbspThese are exciting times for any company or investor looking to engage consumers. We are about to see a whole new crop of marketing companies, and this is great for all of us.\u0026nbspAdam Singolda\u0026nbspis the founder and chief executive of Taboola.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Based on poor data from timelier business surveys, a number of economists think the economy contracted for the first time in seven years in the second quarter, and the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics did not change that view.\u0026nbspThe May car production figures were flattered by a plunge in April when many plants had no choice but to go ahead with planned closures ahead of the previous Brexit deadline of\u0026nbsp29 March.\u0026nbspA longer-term and less-volatile measure of GDP showed that, in the three months to May, economic output rose 0.3 per cent compared with the three months ending in February. That marked\u0026nbspa deterioration from the first quarter when growth stood at 0.5 per cent.“Although there was a modest rally in GDP growth between April and May, the continued slowdown on the underlying three-month measure is further evidence that the UK economy is faltering under the weight of relentless Brexit uncertainty and tougher global economic conditions,” said\u0026nbspSuren\u0026nbspThiru, economist at the British Chambers of Commerce.“Manufacturing activity picked up in May as car production reopened, but the longer-term measures point to a sector under pressure from the running down of excess stock, tougher global trading conditions and rising upfront costs.”Created with Sketch.

And experts say the weaker pound since the EU referendum could have made Britain even more attractive as it is a cheaper place to study.Were the fears of vice-chancellors and academics about the Brexit vote unfounded? It seems too early to say.It is likely that some European applicants will be trying to get into the British system before tuition fees go up and they are no longer entitled to student loans.EU students starting at English universities this year are still eligible for domestic tuition fees, which are £9,250 a year, and student loans. They will also retain these benefits for courses starting in 2020.EU students in England will pay same tuition fees year after BrexitHowever, the fee status and financial support offered to students from Europe could change for the worse in the years after the UK exits the EU, which would make studying in Britain less appealing.European students could be deterred from applying to a UK university if they are made to pay tuition fees of up to £18,000 a year – which international students from outside the EU currently pay.Leaders of universities across the country will breathe a collective sigh of relief at the Ucas data showing that non-UK students still want to study in Britain. But is it just the calm before the storm?\u0026nbspThe Russell Group,\u0026nbspcomprising the most selective universities in the UK, has already seen a drop in the number of EU students enrolling in its institutions. Numbers fell for the first time in five years, figures show.And the situation could get worse with a no-deal Brexit as research funding would be up in the air and greater uncertainty could put off EU students from studying at UK universities.So while the positive trend in the Ucas report is welcome, the full impact of Brexit is yet to be seen.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This meant that Nest’s products, such as its home security cameras, smart thermostat and Nest Protect smoke alarm are now to be found in the Google Store. And that the latest Google home hub product, has Nest in its title: Nest Hub Max.

And those transitions don’t happen very often, they actually happen once a decade.Twenty years ago, you had the transition from PC computing, to web computing. And that was kind of the foundation of Google and many amazing start-ups. And about 10 years ago, when you had the transition from web computing to mobile computing, with the resurgence of Apple and all these great, amazing mobile applications that have been out there the last decade.My belief is that this latest transition is to ambient computing, this notion of having an always accessible computer right at your fingertips, that understands you, that can do things on your behalf to help you in different ways.”Smart home gadgets, like lights that you can control from another room or another country, cameras which can show you if the dog is\u0026nbspon the sofa again, or thermostats that let you turn on the heating in the chilly living room downstairs while you’re snuggling in bed, are common today. But Chandra sees a more integrated future.“When you think about computing, you know, the history of the computer in the last 20 years has been, one integrated device that just keeps getting better. The challenge you have in an ambient computing model is there is no one device which I put in my home, and it just makes my home smart. Instead, you have to take this imaginary computing device, and split it apart. You need different sensors and inputs and outputs across all the different rooms inside your house. And to the consumer, it needs to feel like one. But from a computing standpoint, this is something that we’ve never really done before, this notion of going from an integrated computing system to a distributed computing system, and it’s a big challenge.”Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldAnd that’s just the first challenge. When you look at your mobile phone, it’s a personal device, one with all your data, music, calendar appointments, apps and so on, on it. The future, Chandra says, is different.\u0026nbsp“When you think about ambient computing, it’s actually multiple people interfacing with a technology sitting inside the home. So, it’s about communal experiences as much as about personal experiences. When I put a camera in my house, it’s not just me who is going to interact with it. It’s my kids, my grandparents, my spouse, guests who come into my house. We have to rethink the experience to be both communal, and personal. Now, it doesn’t change the requirement that when I’m interfacing with this device, I want it to know who I am, so that it does things on my behalf. It needs to be able to adjust between a personal experience and a communal experience fairly seamlessly. But it does require that the services also have to understand the context of different people inside the house. If I’m listening to music, for example, and my kids come into the room, it shouldn’t play explicit music, right? It needs to understand that context. And that’s a big change that does not does not really fundamentally exist today.”The more smart home gadgets we put in the house, though, the more we may be concerned about our privacy. Microphones and cameras are useful to let us see and hear what’s going on in our homes, but we’ve got to be sure we are the only ones with access. How do you provide openness and privacy at the same time?“You know, the truth is that privacy is a spectrum, depending on the household you talk to, there’s no one answer that’s going to work for everyone. If you’re not, for example, comfortable with a camera, we’re going to build a product for you. We understand that some people only want a camera that’s on at certain times. Well, great, we’re going to build those controls for you. Because our belief is, we have to build where consumers are, versus having consumers come to where we are.”\u0026nbspRishi Chandra from Google Nest (Google)But when I talk about the smart home, Chandra gently corrects me.“We’re intentionally deviating from the word smart home, because we actually think it’s the wrong word, we actually think it’s a very tech-oriented way of thinking about the home. No one asked for smartness. That’s not an attribute necessarily people care about: what they want is help. We want to go from what a technology does to where it actually provides benefit. And so, our mantra for the next five to 10 years is going to be the notion of how we can help deliver the helpful home. When you think about what the future of the mission of Google is, it’s bringing help to everyone, that’s why we think the home is obviously a place where we can actually deliver that.”The rebrand of Google Nest may be the way to emphasise that intention, a way of unifying two brands that operate in the home to show how they work together. \u0026nbsp“We wanted to introduce a product that was the first to really showcase everything we’re talking about. When we designed the Nest Hub Max, we wanted to be thoughtful about how it brings together different technologies inside the home to deliver an amazing experience, for example, inside the kitchen. And it was that insight that drove us to say, look, instead of asking a user to buy a separate security camera, and a smart display, why don’t we integrate them in one? We wanted one product in the kitchen that delivers everything you need, from security to a photo frame to video conferencing, to kitchen TV capabilities.”So, can we expect to see greater levels of integration, where the Nest thermostat will gain a screen to see who’s at the door, say?“No,\u0026nbspI actually think this level of integration allows us to do exactly not that. Putting a microphone on a thermostat, I actually don’t think makes any sense. What makes more sense is putting a Nest Hub or a Google Home Mini in a different room, where you interact with the products and that’s where the devices should connect together. If you think about it, the portfolio of products we have is tremendous.We have seven different categories in 20 or so products. I think the next evolution of the home is going to be how these devices interface together logically for the consumer. Right now, the industry is like, oh, let’s put a microphone in every product, like a washing machine, say. Why? It doesn’t really make sense. So, in my mind, I want us to step back, he says.Chandra says that if he were to design the ultimate home from scratch it would not be by putting 60 microphones in people\u0027s houses, or placing screens on any available object.

The early modern humans in Greece were replaced by Neanderthals. It was not one exodus out of Africa but lots of small ones.”Scientists rethink human evolution after discovery of ancient tools ‘Neanderthal-like’ teeth reveal early human evolution in EuropeEarly human evolution was ‘multi-ethnic and multicultural’The research, published in the journal\u0026nbspNature, supports the hypothesis that early modern humans spread out of Africa, where they evolved multiple times.This group was probably wiped out by environmental factors – which could have included climatic events and pressure from Neanderthals.Reconstructions of the Apidima 1 cranium revealed a high and rounded shape – a unique feature of modern humans which contrasts sharply with Neanderthals.Researchers conducted numerous comparisons with different human fossils, using\u0026nbspa highly accurate radiometric dating method to determine their age. They also used virtual reconstructions of the damaged parts of the skulls to discover more about the origins of the fossils.\u0026nbspThis discovery is the latest piece in the jigsaw of human evolution which is continually changing in light of new research.Out of Africa\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The only real difference is a lack of rapid eye movement during REM sleep, researchers found.\u0026nbspTo study the fish, they built a fluorescent light-sheet microscope that could image the whole body in extremely high resolution.They recorded brain activity\u0026nbspas the fish\u0026nbspslept and observed heart rate, eye movement and muscle tone, according to the study, published in Nature.\u0026nbspAlthough scientists cannot know for certain that all animals sleep, it appears to be a universal need.\u0026nbspScotland warns Ireland ‘unwise to pick a fight’ over fishing rightsConsumers urged to boycott yellowfin tuna over unsustainable fishingChimpanzees caught fishing for crabsThe exact benefits are still a mystery but people who fail to get enough sleep suffer memory lapses and impaired judgement as well as a higher risk of obesity and high blood pressure.Sleep disorders are also linked with neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.“This research is critical as it strengthens the idea sleep has core functions that are conserved throughout animals such as maintenance and remodelling of neuronal connections,” said Dr Mourrain.\u0026nbspScientists say understanding sleep functions in animals could help us better understand the consequences of sleep disruption.\u0026nbspZebrafish egg ides to form ball of embryo cells“Because fishes’ neural signatures are in essence the same as ours, we can use information about them to generate new leads for drug trials,” said Dr Louis Leung, from Stanford University School of Medicine.\u0026nbspMice – often a stand-in for human research – are nocturnal and a less relevant model for our sleep.“As zebrafish are diurnal like humans, it’s perhaps more biologically accurate to compare fish sleep with humans’ for some aspects,” Dr Leung said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that.

Based on poor data from timelier business surveys, a number of economists think the economy contracted for the first time in seven years in the second quarter, and the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics did not change that view.\u0026nbspThe May car production figures were flattered by a plunge in April when many plants had no choice but to go ahead with planned closures ahead of the previous Brexit deadline of\u0026nbsp29 March.\u0026nbspA longer-term and less-volatile measure of GDP showed that, in the three months to May, economic output rose 0.3 per cent compared with the three months ending in February. That marked\u0026nbspa deterioration from the first quarter when growth stood at 0.5 per cent.“Although there was a modest rally in GDP growth between April and May, the continued slowdown on the underlying three-month measure is further evidence that the UK economy is faltering under the weight of relentless Brexit uncertainty and tougher global economic conditions,” said\u0026nbspSuren\u0026nbspThiru, economist at the British Chambers of Commerce.“Manufacturing activity picked up in May as car production reopened, but the longer-term measures point to a sector under pressure from the running down of excess stock, tougher global trading conditions and rising upfront costs.”Created with Sketch.

discover patterns, and deliver timely insights.”Saturday’s quake, with a magnitude of 7.1, jolted much of California, cracked buildings, set fires, broke roads and caused several injuries while seismologists warned that large aftershocks were expected to continue, according to reports.The epicentre was close to the city of Ridgecrest, about 140 miles north east of Los Angeles.The quake – preceded by Thursday’s 6.4-magnitude temblor in the Mojave Desert, was the largest in southern California for at least 20 years.It was followed by a series of large and small aftershocks, including a handful above magnitude 5.0.On Monday, officials said it could be several more days before water service was restored to the desert town of Trona, where officials trucked in portable toilets and showers.\u0026nbspTen residences in Trona were listed as uninhabitable and officials expected that number to rise as inspectors complete more surveys of the area.Tsunami warning in Indonesia after 7.1

We have to love more, hate less. We have to listen more, and talk less. We have to know that this is everybody’s responsibility\u0027. Clark Mindock reports from the Canyon of Heroes in ManhattanClick to followThe Independent USWith confetti and ticker tape landing on the shoulders of champions and their fans along the Canyon of Heroes in downtown Manhattan, Emma Morrone saw something bigger than the elite players returning to the United States after their World Cup win in France.In the floats that carried the likes of Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan, and Julie Ertz,\u0026nbspalongside the rest of the world championship squad,\u0026nbspthe 17-year-old football player –\u0026nbspor “soccer player” as she, and those around her, would call it here in the US –\u0026nbspsaid she saw role models, not just passing stars.And, the New Jersey high school senior said that she hopes she sees the future in those women who have inspired a nation with their athleticism, and spurred a conversation about equity and rights in America and abroad.“We look up to them, and how they play, and take from their game, learn from their moves,” Ms Morrone said, referring to herself and her two teammates who had made the trek from New Jersey on Wednesday morning, 17-year-old Caitlin Scully and 18-year-old Alex Pardo.That is, they are learning moves from them both on and off the pitch. They see what the US Women’s National Team has done to promote pay equality, an issue that persists for the women in spite of their clear strengths compared to the US men’s team. They see how the players have spoken about and promoted a general sense that one must stand up to bigotry, in general.They want to learn those moves, too.“I think they’re really amazing,” Ms Pardo added. “They make me want to be a better player, and make me want to become involved. When your role model speaks up, it makes you want to speak up.”It wouldn’t be long until Rapinoe herself spoke up once again, hoping to inspire fans like those three teens. On the steps of New York’s City Hall, the co-captain of the world champion team extolled fans to lead in their own lives, and to take on the challenges of making the world a better place.“We have to be better. We have to love more, hate less. We have to listen more, and talk less. We have to know that this is everybody’s responsibility,” Rapinoe said with circular sunglasses reminiscent of John Lennon, and purple hair.She continued, saying that their supporters are more than just fans of a sport who “tune in every four years”.“You interact with your community every single day,” she said. “How do you make your community better?”Rapinoe: US women’s captain sends powerful message to Trump over LGBT+ rightsRapinoe saying ‘I deserve this’ while holding a trophy and a bottle of champagne is a serious moodWith their 2-0 victory over the Netherlands last week, and the run of wins leading up to that world cup victory, the US women’s team has catapulted themselves into the forefront of a national conversation, and the players have proven eager to embrace their platformThey’re currently engaged in that fight for pay equity, with a class action lawsuit including all of the players suing the US Soccer Federation, saying they get paid less than the men’s national team and receive less support, even though they consistently outperform those same men.The proof of that is pretty clear: This year’s World Cup win is the second straight for the American women, while the men’s team didn’t even make it into the same tournament last year. That’s not even accounting for the hard dollars, with women’s games bringing in $50.8m in game revenue between 2016 and 2018, compared to $49.9m for men during that period. The pay structure is complicated, but the women have argued in their lawsuit that there are a range of inequities, including the argument that if they played 20 “friendlies” (where bonuses would not apply), they would earn a maximum of $99,000 while men max out at $263,320 for the same play.That fight, and their representation of the US in France, has brought them some enemies and friends in high places. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris –\u0026nbsptwo presidential candidates, whose merchandise could be seen repped by fans along the parade route on Wednesday – have both praised them. Donald Trump has gotten into fights with them on Twitter.Rapinoe says US Women’s team accept Chuck Schumer’s invite to congress but ‘don’t want to go to the White House’Elizabeth Redwine was among the mothers to line up to catch a glimpse of the champions, and had brought her 11-year-old daughter Lila, and her two friends Ella and Emily.Ms Redwine had picked up a piece of paper from the trash on her way in, and used her lipstick to write a message of solidarity: Equal pay for superior work, her sign read.“I want them to one day be paid as much as their brothers,” she said of the three girls she had brought to see the historic occasion, all three of them athletes.Maggie Gannon, a 24-year-old teacher who moved to New York City from Ohio from Wisconsin on Tuesday, said she chose to start her first full day in the city at the parade because the team is “bringing a voice for young girls and the marginalised”.She said that the chants of “equal pay” that were heard both in Manhattan on Wednesday and in France last week have resonated throughout the country.“We were sitting in a Buffalo Wild Wings in Ohio, chanting with them,” Ms Gannon said, recalling watching the World Cup final.Joanne Shea, a 33-year-old actor, had come with her 18-month-old daughter Maeve, and said that the US women’s team had restored a sense of national pride at a time when she said there are slim pickings.“There’s not been a whole heck of a lot to celebrate lately when it comes to national pride,” Ms Shea said.But, noting that there have been some positive signs in the past few years. In the 2018 midterms, for instance, more women ran for and were elected into Congress than ever before. And, now, the country is taking cues from, and talking about, and obsessing over the women’s World Cup champions that have become the standard bearers of a host of equality issues.“This team has really been a symbol of that,” Ms Shea said. “I think since 2016, women have really been leading the fight.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The last time radiation was measured was in 2008, when a Russian scientists said they had detected a small radioactive leak.“The results are preliminary. We will examine the samples thoroughly when we get home,” Hilde Elise Heldal of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research told Norway’s\u0026nbspTV2 broadcaster.She said despite the readings, the radiation levels do not threaten fishing or the scientific teams working in the area.While operating the remote sub, the scientists witnessed an “occasional cloud” rising from the ventilation pipe. The team believes the pipe may have direct contact with the vessel’s radioactive cargo.“We have observed a kind of cloud coming out of this hole once in a while. In connection with the test in which we measured pollution, a cloud came out of the hole. This may indicate that the pollution comes out in pulses,” Dr Heldal said.The team suggested the ventilation hole at the top of the submarine tower was in direct contact with the reactor inside the wreck.\u0026nbspIs the US accepting the world must live with a nuclear North Korea?Pentagon publishes ‘disturbing’ new nuclear weapons doctrineAccording to TV2, researchers will now monitor the opening of the pipe more closely for the rest of the research period, which is scheduled to finish on Thursday.Dr Heldal said the cloud could be caused by ocean currents, tides or other conditions related to ocean movements.\u0026nbspThe fire on 7 April 1989 began due to a short circuit in the ship’s engine room. The vessel was able to surface for around five\u0026nbsphours. A total of 42 of 69 crew members were killed, mostly of hypothermia while awaiting rescue from the freezing waters.\u0026nbspJust four people were killed from the initial fire and smoke.The new research was undertaken by the Go Sars research vessel, using a new type of remote submersible craft which gives more accurate readings than previous surveys.“We are getting closer to the wreck than ever before, and get an even better sampling,” Dr Heldal said.Ahead of the latest mission to test the submarine, Ingar Amundsen, the director of Norway’s Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Directorate said: “The new surveys that Norway and Russia are about to launch are important for understanding the pollution risk posed by Komsomolets.”The news of Komsomolets’ radioactive leak comes days after the Russian government confirmed a fire had broken out on a top secret nuclear-powered submarine killing 14 sailors, in an incident which also occurred in the Barents Sea.Argentinian submarine found a year after going missingA high-ranking military official reportedly said the sailors who fought the blaze and died had averted a “planetary catastrophe”.The incident remains shrouded in mystery after the Russian government refused to reveal the submarine’s name and its mission, claiming them as state secrets.However, the Kremlin has said the accident was sparked by a fire in the battery compartment of the submarine.Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier this week that the onboard nuclear reactor was “operational” after the crew had taken “necessary measures” to protect it.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But too often, especially as the memory of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq fades, they have been shunted down the policy pecking order.Previous Governments have, to their credit, taken steps in the right direction. But their activities have often been piecemeal or lacking in an overall direction.Giving the money from interest rate-rigging fines to armed forces charities is a good example.A promise of nearly £bn, but a promise that hasn’t been delivered as fully as it should have been, with Ministers even dipping into the pot to cover shortfalls in their own budgets.We need a sea change — and that’s why we’ve partnered with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress to demand a Cabinet Minister takes the reins on this vital issue under a Johnson or Hunt Government.And that Minister mustn’t just be there to turn up for photo ops at far-flung bases.

Not a regular port of call because I’m a Good Morning Britain devotee thanks, in no small part, to the Great Sussex Doughnut hole, Piers Morgan, who took one look at its saccharine sweet format, back in , and thought: “Sod that for roasting politicians and a few home truths.”His tabloid instincts didn’t let him down. Its predecessor GMTV used to be such an easy ride Gordon Brown actually offered its host Fiona Phillips a Government job.These days, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and PM-in-waiting Boris Johnson are both too spineless to go anywhere near the GMB studio.BBC pay was the big story last week, though, so I had to desert ship for Breakfast, where I immediately discovered no one’s paid quite enough to work a five-day week and a squad rotation system is at play.Thursday and Friday it was the horribly mismatched Charlie “errr” Stayt and Naga Munchetty, who are both on £, but have so little on-screen chemistry they make Piers’ and Susanna’s squabbling sound more like Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin — Je t’aime . . . moi non plus, Chunk.Star pairing, however, are the undoubtedly talented and likeable Dan Walkerand Louise Minchinwho can actually bear to look at her co-host and almost won me over with Wednesday’s first link of the day. “Day three of Wimbledon and Carolisn’t looking quite so lovely.”No. And you should see her at the end of the fortnight, Louise.It’s not the clumsiness or the lack of chemistry, though, that make Breakfast feel like you’re stuck with Saturday Superstore when Tiswas is on the other side. It’s the content, which is a marathon BBC right-on whinge.So you seem to get a “gender equality row” , followed by environmental armageddon and an “NHS funding crisis”, every day.Three hours of that and, I promise, you’ll feel like you’ve been embalmed by pulped copies of .Ironically, the show also doesn’t seem to like anyone with a large salary and, on Wednesday, Tesco’s Dave Lewis was being asked by Steph McGovernhe was: “comfortable getting paid what you do”.The brass neck it took to include that segment is quite something when you consider it had absolutely nothing to say about its own scandalously huge wage bill on Wednesday.They even tried to gloss over it during the paper review when the story flashed up on the front page of every newspaper, although Dan Walker did admit: “Lots of people contacting us on that. We always appreciate your feedback.”I hope, then, that Dan Walker appreciates me saying his show’s hypocrisy is every bit as nauseating as the BBC’s excess, ’cos no autocue reader should be paid anything more than £, when pensioners are having to pay for their licence.AndBBC staffers don’t like that figure  Well, they’re free to offer their talents to the private sector and I’ll be sure to tip Naga Munchetty heavily when she arrives with my Deliveroo order, as I really liked the pointed question she posed about a nuisance barnyard animal, on Friday’s paper review.“Is anyone interested in a noisy cock ”To my own surprise and horror, I am.

But I had no idea how sneeringly “modern feudal” the whole circus was about to become.What a dismal little VIP gathering Archie’s christening has turned out to be. A PR disaster.Harry and Meghan insisted on conducting the whole thing in secret, refusing even to reveal who his godparents were.I don’t even care who they are —they are Robbie Williams or that plastic Canadian friend of Meghan’s who looks like a Love Island reject, I’d rather not know.But why make such a snitty point of it unless he’s trolling the very people who admire him It seems so unjoyful — the opposite of what a christening is meant to be.I know what his arguments are. He wants a “normal” le for Archie. He hates the Press and the paparazzi.But the truth is the royals get a huge amount of privacy. They have far more privacy than the average citizen.They are not snapped while picking their noses at a newsagent. They are not filmed going on holiday. No one knows where they go on holiday or even where they are when they are not performing their duties.No one sells stories on their private lives or punts pictures. No one takes pictures or follows them at all, because no newspaper would carry the images.Eventhey are spotted by someone, they have huge security teams, paid for by us, to keep us at bay.The royals do not want privacy, they want a private le in public, and no one has the right to that.In spite of this, Harry appears to have gone what I would describe as the full Hugh Grant. Last week it turned out that the actor has become so obsessed with the idea that the paps were following him he confronted an Italian official who was innocently filming rubbish dumped in the street.Everywhere Harry looks, he sees people who want to take advantage of him, which is not true and leads to this sad irascibility in which he forgets what is kind and decent —  and who is paying the bill.What has become of him  If you scan Meghan and Harry’s Instagram feed, you will see how distant the “people’s prince” has turned out. There is no shortage of cloying information on how much he “cares” about alpacas and Mothering Sunday and advancing his sanctimonious “monthly social awareness approach” on mental health or climate change. But it is extra-ordinary how detached from reality the whole thing feels — it is a syrupy, fantasist’s medley of posturing sub-Beyoncean baloney about animals in “gap yah” locations.But does he really care about any of this stuff It is almost ashe has picked a selection of vague, non-committal subjects specically engineered to give no idea what he is thinking, like Leonardo DiCaprio.The overall effect is truly insincere.While it is clear Harry loves the royal tradition of virtue-signalling, it is obvious he does not enjoy being a royal at all. In fact, he dislikes being royal so much, he has waved through this shell of a person called “Prince Harry” operated by an American marketing droid who writes about “sharing” Harry’s “environmental POV”.There are half a million likes for a snap of the prince looking bored.Meghan has similarly vanished.If she had her way, it would not even be a christening, but a naming ceremony with fire pit curators and celebrity mixologists and D-list actresses as earth parents .She is so embarrassing I wonderedit was the godparents who had actually begged for privacy — you can just imagine Beyonce weighing up whether a second-tier royal christening was cool enough for her to openly acknowledge it.And so we have it: A royal christening in a building we paid for, conducted by a bishop whose salary we help foot, featuring royals whose lives we bankroll, in clothes we have paid for, sitting on seats we bought, waited on by staff we fund, with celebs who are not even sure they want to put their name to it.And they think they can say, “Oh, we’re not telling you anything about it” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After months of dithering, he has finally come out for Remain.From now on, Labour is to be an unashamedly pro-EU movement, dedicated to overturning the  referendum result. Once the voice of the oppressed working class, Labour is now to be the mouthpiece of the Europhile political class.Yesterday, having succumbed to relentless pressure from his anti-Brexit MPs, Corbyn announced that Labour will campaign to stay in the European Union and vote against any deal negotiated by the next Conservative Prime Minister.It is a historic decision, one that graphically shows how Labour has lost both its political compass and its moral authority.The move represents a profound betrayal in every sense — of true democracy, of Labour’s traditions, of its heartland voters and of the cause of national freedom. Corbyn has also savagely betrayed his own values, for he has always been a Eurosceptic who regarded the EU as a barrier to national rights.Now he has emerged as just another identikit member of the chattering, snobbish metropolitan elite, which holds sovereignty and patriotism in contempt.Recently there were reports that when Corbyn was considering a change of stance, his tough Chief of Staff Karie Murphy shouted at him: “We’re not doing that. We’re not selling out our class.” But that is exactly what Corbyn has done.In the process, he has torn up Labour’s democratic credentials and made a mockery of the party’s manesto commitment in the  General Election to “respect the referendum result”.Now Corbyn has shown those words were empty. Labour can no longer pretend it has any belief in the ballot box or any faith in voters.The party was created in  to represent working people in their struggle against the political establishment. Central to the party was a belief in national, democratic sovereignty and a profound hostility to imperialism.That helps to explain why, for decades, Labour was so suspicious of the project for European integration. Clement Attlee refused to have anything to do with the European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of the Brussels empire, while his successor Hugh Gaitskell warned that Common Market membership would mean: “The end of , years of history.” In , under Michael Foot, the party openly campaigned for withdrawal from the European Community.But all that soon changed. Under Neil Kinnock, the party — regularly beaten in general elections — began to see Brussels as a vehicle for the introduction of socialism into Britain without the need for support from voters. Labour’s rampant European enthusiasm was born, and quickly entrenched by Tony Blair.It was a development that dismayed me.Through much of the s and s I was a Labour activist in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North constituency and I shared his views on Brussels.Indeed, his Euro-scepticism was the only thing I admired about him. But I could not stomach Blair’s servile devotion to Brussels. Disillusioned, I left Labour in .Now Labour’s capture by the pro-EU ideologues is complete. “Labour’s hearts are Remain and our values are Remain,” declared the Deputy Leader Tom Watson recently. The party that once campaigned against imperialism now wants us to be subsumed in the EU’s federalist empire.This shameful step has been dressed up as a political necessity because Labour is haemorrhaging political support, down to just  per cent in one recent opinion poll. But Labour is in decline not because of its stance on Europe, but because of the uselessness and extremism of Corbyn’s neo-Marxist leadership.In fact, by alienating Labour’s voters in the predominantly pro-Leave heartlands of the North and the Midlands, Corbyn’s decision is likely to backfire disastrously.It is estimated that more than four million people who backed Brexit in the  referendum voted Labour in the  General Election. Just as importantly, around  per cent of all Labour constituencies had majorities for Leave in the referendum. In fact, many of the most fervent pro-Brexit seats in  are Labour-held — places such as Ruth Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent North, Gloria De Piero’s Ashfield in Nottingham and Melanie Onn’s Great Grimsby, all where virtually  per cent supported Leave.All these seats, and scores of others with slim Labour majorities, will be at risk due to Corbyn’s new policy. Nor will there be any chance of Labour winning any pro-Leave Tory marginals, which are necessary for a Commons majority.The dangers were highlighted in May’s European elections, where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party beat Labour in a string of traditional heartland seats including Hartlepool, Redcar and Bolsover.As the Labour Brexit campaigner Brendan Chilton put it recently: “A pro-Remain policy would be an electoral disaster for the Labour Party on an unprecedented scale. If this were to happen, Labour may never recover.”Well, it has happened. But the sense of betrayal goes far deeper than electoral calculations. This week Labour has dramatically shown where its priorities lie — not with the traditional working class, but with the sneering elitists of the affluent, pro-EU middle class.Tragically, this once proud movement has become a pale imitation of the Liberal Democrats in all their EU worship and disdain for national pride. Instead of embracing its industrial communities, Labour has retreated into its metropolitan enclaves.And this twist has thrown up a bizarre reversal of roles — Corbyn, the eternal rebel, is now the pathetic stooge of the pro-EU establishment, while Boris Johnson, the likely Tory victor, is the real warrior for British justice and liberty. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why risk losing the already fragile goodwill of the public by treating them asthey’re tiresome selfie-hunters  It’s like those celebrities who put a “no photos” hand up when you haven’t even got your camera out.Or the ones who tell journalists the most anodyne fact about themselves, then add: “But don’t quote me on that.” As .It reminds me of the time when I found myself as a “plus one” at the wedding of a Z-list celebrity who had flogged his nuptials to Hello! magazine.Post-ceremony, the guests were left hanging around as the happy couple did their contracted, painfully proooootracted photoshoot, so I sauntered off to the shade of the nearest tree to make a phone call. Within seconds, the groom appeared at my side and hissed: “If you’re filing copy on this, I will have you removed.”I was simply calling home to say goodnight to my five-year-old. Harry and Meghan’s disproportionate defensiveness over their son’s christening smacks of a similar celebrity narcissism.The reality, one fears, is that this whole “privacy please” charade is yet another example where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are blurring the lines between “royal” and “celebrity”. Being the latter means you pay for everything yourself.But being royal means you have -hour police protection funded by us, transport and living expenses funded by us, a £.million refurbishment of your house funded by us and your child is deemed important enough to be baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.And inyou perform the occasional public duty and follow the royal traditions that have sustained the Monarchy for hundreds of years.One of those traditions being the inclusion of godparent names in the royal register. So omitting them from the official court circularis bordering on the non-constitutional.And when the tourist magnet of tradition, pomp and ceremony is pretty much all the Royal Family has left as a bargaining chip with the already hard-pressed taxpayers who fund them, that’s a bold, some might say reckless, move.A recent poll asked, “do the Sussexes have the right to keep godparents’ names secret”, and  per cent said “yes”,  per cent “no”, and  per cent “don’t know”.Don’t know, or don’t care  And therein lies the rub.

while Kate Middleton played with kids George, Charlotte and Louis nearby.The Duchess of Sussex, in a green dress and shades, appeared delighted as she cooed at her little boy - who was christened over the weekend.And sister-in-law the Duchess of Cambridge, , appeared to have her hands full as she followed one-year-old Louis around the grass, before helping him wave at his dad William as he played against Harry at the Billingbear polo club in Wokingham.The mums were later spotted sitting together laughing as little Louis adorably put big sunglasses on and pulled faces at his -year-old aunt Meghan and little cousin Archie.Prince George, five, and Princess Charlotte, four, were also spotted playing on the grass together.The united front comes despite rumours of a feud between the Sussex and Cambridge families and an onslaught of criticism towards Meghan after the Wimbledon photo row. And the mums put on the happy families display in an attempt to put the speculation of bad blood behind them - including that Meghan made Kate cry with her demands in the lead up to the Duke and Duchess of Sussexs wedding last year.Loving mum Kate, who wore a pink summer dress, was today pictured holding youngest child Louis in her arms as he sucked his thumb.She was hands on with her eldest son as well - gently taking away a polo stick away from George after he started to play with the large mallet.Meanwhile, Meghan kept little Archie swaddled in her arms nearby, taking him to chat to doting dad Prince Harry, .Todays royal outing saw Prince William, , take on Harry, with Wills playing as part of the King Power Air Asia team alongside billionaire King Power boss and Leicester City chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha while Harry joined the Tarmac team.Aiyawatt is the son of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who died in a helicopter crash at Leicesters stadium last year - with the polo match held in memory of him.Meghan has this week made headlines after it was claimed her security team tried to stop tennis fans from taking photos of her at Wimbledon.And she was met with a barrage of criticism, including from GMB host Piers Morgan, as reports surfaced she had been a nightmare to accommodate with her casual outfit and self-regarding paranoia.Her reported insistence on privacy is in stark contrast to Kates appearance at Wimbledon on day two as she shunned the Royal Box for seats on Court  - sticking to the players dress code of white and chatting cheerfully with friends.The Duke and Duchess of Sussexs insistence on privacy even saw a shroud of secrecy over their son Archies christening over the weekend.The new parents chose to withhold the names of the godparents of the seventh-in-line to the throne and only released pictures to the media afterwards.Critics were unimpressed with the decision, pointing to recent news that the couple spent £.m of taxpayers money refurbishing their Frogmore Cottage home.Todays joint event with the brothers comes after speculation of a rt between the couples has continued, ever since it was reported Williams concerns over Meghan went down quite badly with Harry.Harry and Meghan then left their home - which was within the Kensington Palace estate where they were living in close proximity to Kate and Wills - to move to Windsor to raise baby Archie.And while doting aunt Kate and uncle William attended the eight-week-olds christening in Windsor on Saturday, the Duchess of Cambridge looked ready to flee in the Royal Family portrait, a body language expert revealed.It does nothing to dispel rumours of a rt between the once dubbed Fab Four, with the Sussexes recently splitting from the joint charity with the Cambridges.The speculated feud has even seen the palace deliberately try to avoid “diary clashes” between Harry, Meghan, William and Kate to prevent “competition”, a royal author claimed.Last November, The Sun exclusively revealed that Meghan left Kate in tears over her strict demands for Princess Charlottes bridesmaid dress.But fans have been left unable to decide who the baby boy looks like more - dad Prince Harry or mum Meghan Markle.Hundreds are convinced Archie is the spitting image of his dad, while some are adamant he has a likeness to Meghan.Others were sure hes a perfect mixture of both, with one tweeting: He might have Meghans lips but definitely not her nose.In May, the Cambridges were accused of “one-upmanship” after they shared an intimate Instagram post shortly after the Sussexes did the same.On their Instagram account, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared a series of unseen pictures from their wedding day on May  last year.And the Queen is very sad by the feud rumours, a royal expert recently claimed."},{"url":null,"title":"emiliano sala pair post mortem pictures","story":"Christopher Ashford, , is said to have watched the autopsy six times over  hours after the Cardf footballer died in a plane crash.He is accused of illegally accessing CCTV at Bournemouth Mortuary and replaying a post-mortem along with Sherry Bray, .Bray also allegedly watched the post-mortem live on February  and then shared an image of the dead footballer on social media.The pair appeared at Swindon Magistrates Court today -

And the direct but illicit involvement of Magic Grandpa himself in what were meant to be independent investigations.Even before that came out, three peers resigned from the party because of the vast numbers of Jew-haters in Labour.One of those to quit is Lord Triesman, a top bloke. He was once a very capable boss of the Football Association. He resigned saying Labour was “instit- utionally anti-Semitic”.And he added that “the experience of le in the party has become sickening”.Even Corbyn’s closest allies among Labour MPs have had enough of him. Diane Abbott, for example. And the Shadow Chancellor, the sinister John McDonnell.Other Labour MPs are sick of being bullied by the convocation of weird Maoists, Trots and Leninists who surround Corbyn. People such as Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray .All of this has helped Labour sink to an astonishing all-time low of  per cent in the polls — at a time when we’ve had the worst Conservative Government in memory. Or at least since John Major was in charge.And now the party has finally turned its back on the people it was set up to support, the working class.It has decided to back the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, junking its previous decision to “respect the vote”.Hundreds of thousands of Labour voters in the North of England will be lost to the party as a consequence, possibly for ever.So the knives are out for Grandpa and I don’t see him lasting much longer. It is now a case of WHEN he goes, not IF he goes. But even when he goes, what can a new leader do with this rabble Don’t forget, the party is controlled entirely by the activists. And those are the , middle-class, liberal lefties and perpetual adolescents who joined the party en masse for three quid to ensure Corbyn was elected leader.They have nothing in common with Labour’s old voter base, the working class. They are opposed to Brexit. They are in favour of Hamas, Venezuela and Cuba. They support identity politics, with its endless hierarchy of victimhood groups.So the likelihood, then, is that a new leader will also come from the juvenile far Left.There are some great Labour MPs who would make excellent leaders of the party — Caroline Flint, for example, or Jon Cruddas. But do they stand a chance any more, seeing how the party is It’s more likely we’ll end up with John McDonnell, an unrepentant Marxist who thought IRA bombers should be given honours by the British government. Or one of his and Corbyn’s proteges.It could well be the end of the party as a viable political force full-stop.Ah well. Time to say goodbye to Jezza. It was fun while it lasted, mate. In a really grim kind of way.GRIM viewing, wasn’t it  That leadership debate.Smirky Hunt trying to convince everyone he has charisma and stands a chance of winning. And our next Prime Minister, Bozo, incapable of giving a straight answer to anything.Can you imagine asking Boris the time “Well, ha ha, I think that’s a very interesting question. And some people may be prepared to tell you it’s eleven o’clock, or perhaps five to five. But I’m not going to do that. No. Not me. That’s for others to say.“I will tell you, beyond all doubt, that it is definitely not seven o’clock, and that’s the important thing, the thing voters care about. And that’s why I think I should be your Prime Minister. Because I will never tell the electorate it is seven o’clock when it isn’t. And, indeed, even when it is.“Does that answer your question, Julie ”GOOD – he’s gone. Sir Kim Darroch, our ambassador to the US.Caught out when leaked messages revealed he thinks Donald Trump is “inept” and the White House dysal.He had to go, evenhe has become a darling of the liberal establishment here for hating Trump.Here’s a suggestion. How about we get as his replacement someone who understands Trump and Trump’s appeal to US voters DO you really think Boris Johnson is going to get us out of the European Union  Properly, I mean, much as we voted for If so, pass the hallucinogens. I could do with getting out of my head too.My guess is we will leave in part, with a deal slightly weaker than the dog’s breakfast Theresa May put before us. And don’t be too surprised by a general election pretty soon. That will cheer us all up.Never have so many people been let down by their leaders. You can read about how Brexit was betrayed in my new book, The Great Betrayal, out next week.It’s a sorry story and it should make you angry. Mind you, it’s also quite funny,you have a warped sense of humour.THIS is Geronimo the alpaca.

But nine out of ten of Britain’s .million veterans don’t know about it.So The Sun has teamed up with the Ministry of Defence-backed ­initiative as part of our vital Never Forget Them campaign.We want all veterans to get a better deal when shopping or paying for services — including meals out, travel and even holidays — not just the , who have signed up.And we are calling on more businesses — of any size — to swell the ranks of the , firms offering money off.It comes after The Sun this week demanded our next Prime Minister back our three-part Veterans’ Pledge:Julia Cooper, , landlady of The Don bar, a hub for many veterans, in Stockton-on-Tees, Co Durham, said: “I can’t thank The Sun enough for standing up for former servicemen and women.“Many of the men who come here served in Northern Ireland and they live in fear of being arrested and charged for serving their country.”Key to the Defence Discount Service scheme is the Defence Privilege Card, which veterans can use in stores and at businesses large and small and get up to a third off. Discounts can be found online and via an app.George Rogerson, , who served seven years in the Gloucestershire Regiment, including three tours in Northern Ireland, hailed the scheme as “a recognition of service to the country”.The former Lance Corporal, who was mentioned in dispatches after saving the le of his wounded­ commander under sniper fire in Belfast, has used the discount card since .George, from Chirk, Clwyd, said: “Veterans like me did our bit for your country and I use my card virtually every week and save money. I don’t regard it as charity.When I show my card and get discount, it’s like a recognition of my service to the country and a ‘thank you’. I’ve lost count of the hundreds of pounds I have saved over the years.”Another veteran saved £ on his phone alone from EE. Yet virtually none of the veterans The Sun spoke to yesterday in The Don had heard of the scheme.Among them was Pete Gaines, , of Sedgefield, who served  years with the Royal Artillery. Pete, who has not worked since a heart attack at , vowed: “I am going to sign up and save myself money.”Or visit Google Play or the Apple App Store and download the Defence Discount Service app.The app allows members to search for discounts in their local area as well as browse discounts on the move.It is FREE to join butyou want the Defence Privilege card, which you can carry in your wallet, there is an admin fee of £., which lasts for five years.Tony Walls, , from Thornaby on Tees, was another in The Don keen to join in.An ex Corporal who served  years with the Pioneer Corps, leaving in , he thought the scheme was only for those still serving.He said: “I had heard of this scheme but I didn’t think it was for me. I am certainly going to check it out.”The scheme means veterans and serving Armed Forces can enjoy discounts ranging from ten per cent off to, in some cases,  per cent discount on thousands of everyday items.It is not just giants such as Starbucks, National Express, Jet holidays, Enterprise Rent A Car, Halfords and KFC that take part. Thousands of small businesses are also on the list of , firms — such as bridal shop Willoughby  Wolf, in Marlborough, Wilts.Victoria and Spencer Wolf only opened the shop last September but signed up to the DDS scheme because former Warrant Officer Spencer, , serv­ed  years in the Royal Signals.Victoria, , said: “We benefitted from the scheme with discounts on things like cinema tickets and when we became business owners we wanted to pass that benefit on to other veterans.”Already they have given discounts totalling around £ to serving soldiers or former servicemen and women.Victoria added: “The first thing I ask our brides-to-be is do they have a brother, husband, father or close ­relative who has served or is serving  I point them in the right direction. Spencer spent over  years serving this country. Being able to pass on some benefit is really important to us.”The Sun is urging more companies to sign up. And the message is already getting through.Last night food giant Iceland confirmed it is considering giving discounts to veterans.And Cadbury World in Birmingham said it offers a  per cent discount for the military, who can bring up to six people with them on a booking. They just need a form of military ID or be a member of the Defence Discount Service.We will pass them to the Defence Discount Service so your firm can help those who served and boost your business by gaining loyal new customers.The more companies that get involved the more we can help our ­veterans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

sparking a tense standoff in the Persian Gulf, US officials revealed.But HMS Montrose quickly trained its mm deck guns on the enemy boats and warned them off, they added.The British Heritage tanker was being escorted through the flashpoint region by the Montrose amid feverish tensions between Iran and the West.But the Navy frigate rallied into action when the rival boats approached the oil tanker and demanded it change course into Iranian waters.According to the anonymous officials, the Montrose came up from the rear of the tanker and aimed its weapons at the Iranians - before issuing a verbal warning to get away.One of the officials said: The Royal Navy HMS Montrose, which was also there, pointed it guns at the boats and warned them over radio, at which point they dispersed.The other added: It was harassment and an attempt to interfere with the passage.A US aircraft was flying overhead at the time and recorded footage of the standoff, the officials said.Confirming the standoff, a Government spokesperson urged Iran to de-escalate the situation in the region.The Government spokesman said: Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz.HMS Montrose was forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away.We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.Initial reports from the US said that five Iranian vessels had harassed the tanker.Responding to the reports, US Central Command spokesman Cpt Bill Urban said: Threats to international freedom of navigation require an international solution.The world economy depends on the free flow of commerce, and it is incumbent on all nations to protect and preserve this linchpin of global prosperity.UK defence officials have previously confirmed that the Montrose had been deployed to the region to perform a maritime security role.The British Heritage ship - operated by BP - earlier made an “abrupt” u-turn and ed to the safety of Saudi Arabia’s coastline on Sunday.It had been heading to Iraq’s Basrah terminal when satellite trackers showed it mysteriously changing course.The attempted capture comes just days after British Royal Marines seized an Iranian crude oil supertanker off Gibraltar.Commandos dramatically detained the Grace  tanker over suspicions it was carrying oil to its ally Syria in violation of EU sanctions last week.Iran later issued a chilling threat of retaliation for last Thursdays daring raid.President Hassan Rouhani warned on Wednesday that the UK will suffer consequences for its actions.He said: I tell the British that they are the initiator of insecurity and you will understand its consequences later.And Irans Major General Mohammad Bagheri warned the seizure of the Grace  will not go unanswered.Tensions continue to rise between Iran and the West after the Islamic Republic last week announced it was upping its uranium enrichment programme.Tehran plans to increase its production beyond the limits imposed by the  Iran Nuclear Deal - which the US walked away from earlier this year.US President Donald Trump said the deal had been too soft - but it was still supported by other western backers including the UK.Following Irans announcement, Trump vowed on Wednesday that sanctions on Iran would soon be increased, substantially!Last month, President Trump called off a planned airstrike on Iranian military targets at the last minute in retaliation for the shooting down of an unmanned US drone.Iran had earlier been blamed for a series of devastating sea mine attacks on US-linked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. "},{"url":null,"title":"four bed house incredible secret bar inside","story":"The £k property in trendy Hackney comes with a private garden and a bespoke fitted kitchen -

So when it came to applying for disability benefit, they struggled in a world of websites and online forms. That was when Nick Leaman came to the rescue. The advisor with Bristol-based financial education charity Talking Money came to their house, and took care of everything. “Nick is a hero to us,” says Emlyn, . “He comes over and immediately puts you at ease. He knows exactly what to say and is so knowledgeable. “I am from the old school, and to understand something I need it in my hand. I don’t even know how to switch a computer on. But everything is online these days. I can’t even print out a form.  We are just relieved that Nick came over and explained everything to us and help us out.” Nick’s help was invaluable for the couple, who are both disabled and struggle to get out, and were falling behind on their rent. Nick’s work with Talking Money involves helping people who find themselves victims of fraud or who may be struggling with debts and don’t know where to turn. And the financially qualied advisor helps people access the benefits they are entitled to, with free specialist advice and ongoing support when they need it most. Over the last year the charity has received more than , enquiries and helped more than , people with advice and casework.They have also secured £.m for vulnerable low-income households by identying and applying for additional benefits they’re entitled to, including appealing negative decisions around housing benefit, sickness and disability benefits and Universal Credit .The majority of Nick’s work is through face to face consultations in Bristol and the surrounding area.  And he says many of his older clients struggle with the internet. “Older people are missing out because they can’t navigate online. I do feel compassion for them. They suffer from a lack of knowledge and access to information. Many of the best deals are online too so they miss out in that way too.” But the majority of people Nick helps are of working age. “It used to be the case that they had racked up huge credit card debts. But it has changed. The issues are now that they are struggling to pay rent and utility bills because they just don’t have the funds. Often they are in work, but they don’t get given enough hours or just not being paid enough. Or it might be the case they are facing financial crises because of unexpected le changes, such as relationship break-up, redundancy and bereavement. “It is also scary how much fraud is out there and how many people get scammed. Fraudsters are getting increasingly confident and can be so convincing. I had one lady who received a text saying she owed thousands to HMRC. It was a con, but she almost fell for it and was going to pay even though she was barely able to afford her rent. The problem is thatyou are desperate you are more likely to fall for scams like this because you just don’t think sensibly.” Despite the enormous demand on him, Nick loves his work. “It can be stressful but it is also really fulfilling because you are here to help people.  Evenyou can improve their lives just a little, that can make a huge dference to them.

In our  manesto we committed to oppose a No Deal Brexit and the Tories’ disastrous Brexit plans – which threaten jobs, living standards, and the open multicultural society that we as internationalists value so much. We developed a compromise plan based around a customs union, a strong single market relationship and protection of rights at work and environmental standards. We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together. But the Prime Minister has refused to compromise and was unable to deliver, so we ended cross-party talks.    Now both Tory leadership candidates are threatening a No Deal Brexit – or at best a race to the bottom and a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump that runs down industry, opens up our NHS to yet more privatisation, and shreds standards on vital things like food safety and workers’ rights. I have spent the past few weeks consulting with all the dferent parts of the Labour movement – our members, MPs and the trade unions – on how we respond to this new situation.

Dan Hogan, a former disputes investigator for the party claimed he had been “overruled” by staff brought in by General Secretary Jennie Formby when she was appointed in March .    He said they had “downgraded what shouldaposve been a suspension to just an investigation or worse to just a reminder of conduct, effectively a slap on the wrist.” And one former party staffer claimed Mr Corbyn’s top advisor, Seumas Milne, “laughed” at suggestions for how the party could root out anti-Semitism. Mike Creighton, Labour’s former Head of the Labour Disputes team, said he was approached by Mr Milne for advice in spring . Mr Creighton said: “[Milne] said, I want to talk to you about anti-Semitism, how we deal with it. And I gave him my advice, which as I recall was two things one was, we should deal with some of the top level anti-Semitic cases much more swtly and much more robustly. “Second thing I suggested was that it would be the right time for Jeremy Corbyn as leader, to make a signicant speech on the issue of the Middle East, particularly saying that Israel had a right to exist.”    Mr Creighton claimed Mr Milne laughed at his suggestions. “He actually laughed at me… I thought he actually wanted to know how we tackle anti-Semitism within the Labour Party.  I think what he actually meant to say was, how do we deal with the bad publicity we’re getting ” Labour dispute that such a conversation took place, saying the allegation was “ and malicious.” They said: Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly expressed his support for Israel’s right to exist and for a two state solution... so there is no reason whatsoever to laugh at any such suggestion.” A Labour source told the Mirror: “The Labour Party is currently rotten to the core and it comes from the very top.” They added: “The level of political interference is breathtaking and demonstrates that antisemitism is not taken seriously by the people charged with running the party. “We cannot survive whilst they both prioritise loyalty and personal paranoia over tackling the cancer of antisemitism.”    The programme claimed to have seen emails which showed Ms Formby trying to intervene in an investigation into activist Jackie Walker. In an email sent last May, Ms Formby allegedly attacked the approach of the party’s National Constitutional Committee, the independent body within the Labour Party that has the final say over expulsions. She’s claimed to have written: “The NCC cannot be allowed to continue in the way that they are at the moment, and I will also be challenging the  for the Jackie Walker case.” Itaposs claimed Jeremy Corbyn was personally copied into the email. A further alleged email from Ms Formby appeared to suggest she had deleted the email because there were “too many eyes still on my Labour address.” Labour said Ms Formbyaposs intervention had been intended to speed up the process, noting that Ms Walker had since been expelled from the party.

You will not have heard anyone say: Jeremy Hunt  Brilliant! No-one has made the effort to describe what a great bloke Boris Johnson appears to be. And nobody, but nobody, has rhapsodised about what a great idea Brexit is for ages. While they spin, bluster and refuse to tell us what they wonapost do, itaposs the subjects theyaposre dancing around we all ought to be paying attention to. Subject : Sovereignty of Parliament The Brexit twats said we had to Brexit so Parliament had more power over our laws. Before we have even Brexited, they have decided Parliament has too much power, and should therefore be shut down so laws can be enacted without it. Subject : Control of our borders We were told we must Brexit to to control the flow of trade and people across our borders. The Brexit twats are now furiously denying there will be any controls at all on the one border we share with the EU. Subject : Letaposs spend £m on the NHS insteadThis works out to £.bn a year, but because the number is entirely wrong itaposs actually £.bn. Either way, the NHS funding gap is about £bn a year and growing.Youaposll note they didnapost say the EU costs us each p a day, letaposs spend it on the NHS instead. Subject : Brave new trade deals Secondhand bassoons, jumpers from the Faroe Isles, and selling the NHS to Donald Trump. Let us say no more about it. Subject : The will of the people This one is still occasionally mentioned, although in increasingly-quieter voices. Because the will of the people has, for the best part of two years, been solidly Remain. Leave constituencies have voted in Remain campaigners, there were more Remain than Leave MEPs elected last month, and everyone whoaposs not a blind, bonkers Tory can see Brexit has gone the way of the Norwegian blue. Today, what theyaposre not telling you is that John Major was once considered the most pathetic, grey, boring, rudderless, bastard-beset, pea maniac Prime Minister weaposve ever had. And he is now the Tory Partyaposs best hope.While Vanilla bitchslaps Marmite on the TV hustings, a man once ridiculed by the entire nation for being a middle-aged Clark Kent without the superpowers has snapped his power pants back on and declared heaposll wrestle either one of them to their political death.Stop staring at our potential PMs for a moment, asking yourselves how it is possible these two unappetisers are the best the natural party of government can offer. Marvel instead that the voice of sanity now looks and sounds a lot like an aged Mr Bean. Sir Johnaposs reputation has changed since he left Downing Street. We have since been exposed to claims that he shared bathwater, among other things, with Edwina Currie.Once upon a time that was one of the more shocking political sex scandals. It was news that made people stop eating their dinner with their fork halfway to the mouth, their eyes widening as they said: Wha  But those were more innocent times.  Major was the last Tory PM to defeat the anti-European wingnuts in his own party. In  he signed the Maastricht Treaty, the deal which helped to form the modern European Union.The fact he won that fight is the reason a more youthful Nigel Farage left the Conservative Party. It is why, a year later, UKIP was founded by an economist. And a little after that, a faction led by Farage ousted that leader on the grounds he was too intellectual.To be fair, then, this is very much Majoraposs fight. If you criticise David Cameron for running away, mild-mannered Major should be praised at least for coming back.It must be coincidence that Mad Cow Disease is coming too.   We all know proroguing Parliament, and making laws only a minority want, is undemocratic. But by threatening a judicial review, Major has exposed the fact itaposs un-Tory, too.No patriot should seek to destroy civil institutions that work just fine. No democrat should hold the people to an opinion they no longer hold. And no Tory should f*** business. Prostitutes, pigs, secretaries - these are all, sadly, expected. Perhaps even Edwina, in extremis. But Brexit means destroying Parliamentary sovereignty, promising a total lack of border control, ignoring the will of the people and wasting billions of pounds on schemes we currently enjoy with % cashback.   Boris Johnson will tell you to be optimistic about all of that. Jeremy Hunt says it must happen. Both of them are wrong. Because John Major, for all his flaws, are all the things they are not.He is a former Prime Minister. He is an election-winner. He defenestrated Margaret Thatcher. He saw off the Eurosceptics. He survived not only ridicule but the worldaposs worst Currie.And he s bearing the Brexit kryptonite - facts, democracy, the rule of law, and good old British sovereignty which says we are ruled by the Parliament, the courts, and the governments we choose.

The process of securing ferry freight capacity by the Transport Department as part of No Deal planning left the coutnry footing a huge bill with very little to show for it, warned the Commons Public Accounts Committee chair Meg Hillier MP The PAC report also expressed concern that preparations for leaving the EU on October  risk running out of time. The committee, which scrutinises the value for money and effectiveness of public spending, said: Prior to the previous planned departure date of March , , we had raised concerns with a number of departments about the rate of progress with the preparations. With little lead time left, the Department for Transport undertook a rushed and risky procurement of additional ferry capacity which opened it to a court challenge from Eurotunnel, which had been excluded from the procurement, and which culminated in an out-of-court settlement costing £ million. Coupled with the £. million cost of cancelling the contracts with the ferry operators, the total cost of this procurement to the taxpayer stands at around £ million.    The report said the Transport Department must learn from this episode.Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has come under heavy fire from the opposition over Brexit planning.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the report exposed the Governmentaposs shambolic no-deal preparations. It is beyond belief that he should be given another opportunity to squander public cash and throw our transport networks into chaos, he said. This country cannot afford Chris Grayling. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has come under heavy fire from the opposition over Brexit planning. MPs said they were concerned that Government departments appear to be waiting for clear instructions on what they should now plan for on Brexit. The PAC stated: We acknowledge that without political certainty it is challenging, but the Government needs to inject direction into departmentsapos preparations for leaving the EU with a deal, without a deal, or any delay, as a matter of urgency. PAC chairwoman Meg Hillier said: In just four monthsapos time, on October , the UK is expected to leave the EU yet momentum appears to have slowed in Whitehall. Departments must urgently step up their preparations and ensure that the country is ready. The taxpayer has been landed with a £ million bill with very little to show for it following the rushed procurement of ferry freight capacity. This £ million Eurotunnel settlement comes on top of the money paid to cancel the ill-fated ferries deal.    Public benefits from the settlement with Eurotunnel amount to little more than window dressing. The department needs to keep a close eye and ensure that Eurotunnel deliver what is promised. The report found: Momentum appears to have slowed in Whitehall, with preparations for the UK leaving the EU on October  not happening quickly enough. The Department for Transport says that its immediate arrangements for leaving the EU were stood down after April and that it was reviewing the apossensible course to take to step those up againapos. We remain concerned that departmentsapos preparations are being left too late. The window for decision-making for any departure on October  is short and key deadlines for decisions are passing every day. The Government must ensure that departments urgently step up their preparations on the assumption that the UK could be leaving the EU on October  and be ready to implement them. With the Government needing to make imminent decisions about ferry freight options, the PAC said: The Department for Transport should set out within weeks what it has learnt from this procurement to ensure it does not expose the taxpayer to unnecessary risk and excessive cost in the future and particularly in its preparations for October . A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: The freight capacity contracts were taken out as an insurance policy for the UK to ensure that key medical supplies could be guaranteed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Dr David Mackereth, , who is a practising Christian, admitted he would not use pronouns relating to someoneaposs chosen sex as it interfered with his religious beliefs. The doctor claims the Department for Work and Pensionsunfairly suspended him from his post as a disability claim assessor. He has now taken the DWP to an employment tribunal. Dr Mackereth, from Dudley in West Midlands, was dismissed following a conversation with a manager at Birminghamaposs Fiveways assessment centre in June . The -year-old admitted he would not refer to a ft tall bearded man as madam because of his beliefs that being male and female are unchangeable and fundamental to who we are as people who were created in the image of God.  Dr Mackereth said in a statement at the start of the Birmingham tribunal: In truth, the argument between us arose not because of any realistic concerns over the rights and sensitivities of transgender iniduals, but because of my refusal to make an abstract ideological pledge to call any six-feet tall bearded man aposmadamapos on his whim. Throughout this process I kept stressing that my objection to that misuse of pronouns was based on my Christian beliefs and conscience. Dr Mackereth also quoted from the Bible, which he described as the infallible, inerrant word of God. Claiming transgenderism being regarded as normal was the result of political pressure, Dr Mackereth added: I cannot in good conscience go along with those ideas - for example by using peopleaposs chosen pronouns, instead of those naturally pertaining to their sex. As far as I am concerned, to do so would be both dishonest and irresponsible. Dr Mackereth, whose world view is unashamedly Christian, replied to an advert for the job in May  and was interviewed by recruitment firm manager James Owen. Having obtained the post, the experienced emergency department doctor was sent on a two-week training course in Marylebone, London. Dr Mackereth said documents he was provided with before the course did not indicate he may be required to use pronouns in accordance with arbitrary choices rather than in accordance with English grammar and common sense. Giving his account of a meeting with Mr Owen on June   at the Birmingham assessment centre, Dr Mackereth said: I was engaged in working on my second real case when Mr Owen called me out of my work. The purpose was to interrogate me about my beliefs in relation to the use of pronouns.

CCTV footage of the crash shows Esmailaposs car mounting the pavement and slamming into the crowd, throwing some of the men into the air. Chef Fuad Ahmed, , suffered multiple fractures to his arm, a broken ankle, a fractured nose and his eye popped out of its socket after the mph collision, the Old Bailey heard.    Esmail had started swinging drunken punches at late night revellers after he was barred entry to the pub in the early hours of  December . Judge John Dodd, QC, said: You drove the car mercilessly and quite deliberately. There is, in my view, something particularly cowardly about the using of a car as a weapon. This was a shocking and terrying event, fuelled by at least drink. You were turned away because the venue was hosting a private party, you fought with the door staff before beating a retreat.  Your parting shot was, however, to say that you would be back. With you at the wheel, that car plainly became a lethal weapon. Shauna Ritchie, prosecuting, said: There appears to have been an altercation outside a shisha bar. There was a refusal to allow this defendant and others he was with to enter the premises. The altercation began as the result of the fact they werenapost allowed into a party. Esmail got behind the wheel of an Ubeeqo rental car as the row escalated. The prosecutor added: He drove onto the pavement, navigating street furniture including a bin.  He drove straight at five people who were standing outside that shisha bar. They each sustained serious injuries. Judge Dodd said the five men each suffered serious injuries, including broken arms, legs and shoulders. He added: These are the sort of injuries that are likely to resonate down the years. These are horrendous injuries. People standing on a pavement ought to feel safe rather than being mown down by a car. This was a terrying incident for all concerned, added Ms Ritchie.  Mr Ahmed has now lost his livelihood working as a chef and a mechanic because of the horric injuries to his arm, ankle and his eye. He said it came out of his head, essentially it is knocked out of its socket, explained Ms Ritchie, adding that miraculously Mr Ahmed still has vision in the affected eye. The eye can get dry and extremely painful. He had suffered a broken arm and wrist, it was broken in eight places. He says he will never have full mobility in one hand. He cannot walk without the help of crutches. He explained that he feels he is now dependant on painkillers and also his mental health has suffered as a result of the incident. Mr Ahmed told police: In short, this person, the defendant, has ruined my le. The Met Police said Esmail ditched the car after the crash and fled on foot with other occupants of the vehicle.

Sarah Mennell, from Hull, says she does not mind spending hundreds of pounds on school unorms because they are an investment in her childrenaposs education. The mum-of-five claims the massive outlay gives her children pride and a push to do well at school, Hull Live reports. Ms. Mennell was speaking following a campaign to reduce the cost of unorms to make it poverty proof.    Her eldest daughter Tiamarie joined Kingswood Academy in Hull last year and her eldest son, Jackdaniel, joins this September. Having purchased their full branded unorms, including PE kits, the mum has spent more than £ each. Mrs Mennell, also mum to Sydney, ten, Princess, six, and Albert, four, said: I personally think the price is reasonable. The full Kingswood unorm with rugby tops, shorts, tracksuit, rugby socks, ties and all shoes are around £ in total. It’s a investment in their education. If the kids feel smart and look smart it really helps them and it helps them fit in. The unorm campaign has gained support from parents who urge schools to cut the cost of unorm by removing the requirement to use branded, more expensive items. The children wear this unorm for nearly seven hours a day. The quality is better than cheaper brands and my daughteraposs looks as good as it did a year ago.    Having the whole school unorm really gives them a push and makes them feel proud. My daughter has  per cent attendance for the time in her first year at secondary school. Usually she has the odd day off in primary school, but no, she has to attend and keep her  per cent. This is not us making her go, even when she might be a little off she literally never wants to miss a day’s education. She is up at .am, school unorm on and is dressed. As soon as she home she in her non unorm and folds it up and hangs it herself because she’s proud to wear it. Where my kids usually sling it in the floor the value of the unorm teaches them respect. I could have probably got it cheaper buying cheaper trousers and shirts shoes but the quality is not as good. I would rather pay that little bit more and get decent comfy quality items once then buying them all again every three to four months. At Kingswood Academy, the blazer, tie, jumper, skirt and PE kit must be purchased at the school.  Parents have the option to purchase trousers where but parents are warned even where shops describe unorm as school wear, the clothes may not meet the schoolaposs policy.    Mrs Mennell said the price is fair due to the quality of the clothes, and said her daughteraposs lasted all year during her first year at the school. She said: I think you pay for what you get,you want cheaper unorms you will get cheaper made unorms that won’t last. The quality and design is much better then cheaper options from supermarkets I think the price of the unorms are fair becauseyou break it down over the year you spend around the same as cheaper unorms. Tiamarie used to go though trousers and shirts and shoes every three months when we got them from supermarkets, but the Kingswood unorm has lasted all year and her shoes are spotless. Mrs Mennell says she budgets so she is able to afford it and even has unorm accounts for her children.

Experts believe “Cheers” originated from the old French word chiere which meant “face” or “head.” By the th century it meant “gladness,” and was used as a way of expressing encouragement. The study also found the majority of us now prefer to use more contemporary language to show our thanks. According to the data one in five believe saying “thank you” sounds too formal – opting for catchier, chatty words like “cool”, “awesome” or “sorted”. Other phrases used to replace the two little words of gratitude include “brilliant”, “nice one” and “ta”. Overall  per cent of Brits feel as a nation we should be a little more thankful and do more to show gratitude for hard work, kindness and acts of generosity.    A spokesman for Lottoland, which carried out the study of , adults to celebrate its  millionth customer and sixth birthday, said: “Saying thanks – or an appropriate alternative phrase – can go a long way to make others feel special and worthy. “As this study shows, there are many ways to express appreciation, in addition to words this might be a hug for someone special or a high five for a good friend.aposapos The study also found Brits opting for Spanish, French and German methods of thanks by saying “gracias”, “merci” or “danke”.

A resounding eight in  believe people should be thanked more for kind actions and loyalty – with more than half claiming a nod or other gesture is sometimes used instead of actual words.The  OnePoll  survey also revealed Brits are most likely to show their thanks for something when given a present or when someone holds open a door .Other scenarios asking for a show of respect include being bought a drink , being given change after making a paymentand after being told you look nice . Gratitude is also likely to be expressed when receiving a card , someone saving you a seator after enjoying a meal in a restaurant . But a third of Brits admitted they could probably do with showing their thanks to others a bit more, perhaps with a nice gesture, as eight in  claim when they do something nice, it makes them feel really good.

The spokesman for Lottoland added: “Saying thank you, or cheers, or awesome, can go such a long way to make a person feel special. “All too often people forget to express their gratitude, whether that’s to someone serving them, to a customer, or to a family member who is always there. “Receiving thanks can make you want to work harder, continue to be loyal, or be even kinder in the future. “Here at Lottoland, we’re saying a big thank you after hitting a landmark  million customers by offering our players some fantastic one-off prizes – including a US MegaMillions and PowerBall combo that will draw in a whopping jackpot of over a billion pounds.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror sir kim darroch","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Sir Kim Darroch being forced to resign is a betrayal of our nationThe next humiliation would be a trade deal that lets US firms export their chlorinated chicken and batter down the doors of our NHSShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  JUL NewsopinionBoris Johnson and Sir Kim Darroch \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSir Kim Darroch’s dignied resignation as our man in Washington stands in stark contrast to the yellow-bellied behaviour of those who forced him out.

The next humiliation would be a trade deal that lets US firms export their chlorinated chicken and batter down the doors of our NHS. So much for seizing back control. Pension scam Thousands of women have been penalised by the change in the retirement age. Now they are being punished yet again for taking time out of work to raise a family or look after an elderly relative. A report says women have £, less in pension pots than men.  The shortfall is compounded by the fact they often earn less than their male counterparts and are more likely to be in part-time jobs. Auto-enrolment is helping bridge the gap, but more must be done to help women remain in work. That means providing better childcare and social care.

Working part-time to balance caring responsibilities for children and then elderly parents has the biggest impact on women’s ability to save for their future. It results in a % reduction in pension savings for females by their late s, compared to men. When they reach their s, women have £, set aside for a pension – just a third of the average £, nest egg for a man. While the proportion of women working is now .% – the highest female employment rate since records began in  – two in five are in ­part-time roles. This means many may fail to meet the £,-a-year threshold in a single job to be auto-enrolled into a workplace pension. So they will miss out on saving for their retirement, and receiving employer contributions.  This is compounded by the fact that women earn less than men – the gender pay gap is currently % – and they live . more years than men on average. It means smaller pensions must last longer. The report from The Pensions Policy Institute and NOW:Pensions found the biggest harm to women’s pension saving occurs in their s. This is the typical age when they are likely to care for children. However, by their s many will also have moved into part-time work to look after their parents or grandchildren – leaving them falling even further behind when saving for retirement.    Joanne Segars, interim ­chairwoman of trustees at NOW:Pensions, said: “Not only are women paid less, they are much more likely to take time out of the workforce. This has a huge impact and the part-time pensions penalty can’t afford to be ignored. “Small changes to auto ­enrolment could make a big dference for women but to really bridge the gap more need to be done to help mums remain in the workplace.” Fearing for my future: A case study  New mum Cheriton Alexander, of Colchester, Essex, is currently on maternity leave and has big concerns about how this will affect her future finances. “My son Aeron is almost six months and I’m now on statutory maternity pay for the rest of my planned  months break from work. That means less to live off, during an expensive time in our lives, said Cheriton, . “I believe my workplace pension is currently frozen until Ito work, so there will be a big dent in it. There’s so much to consider and sort out leading up to having a baby and going on maternity leave. You tend to focus on the now and imminent next. When the baby arrives you have to live day-to-day and are not thinking about something twenty or thirty years away. There also isn’t much information about pensions and having children. If there had been maybe I would have tried to find a way to keep paying something in, even a smaller amount. I know I need to think about my pension savings and find some way to try and top them up when I’m back working. I really don’t want to have money worries later in le.”  This will be the second time Cheriton, who works in the financial industry, has stopped saving into a pension. “I had a career break a few years back to study at University, so wasn’t putting anything away during that time either. It’s dficult for women as we already earn less in the first place than men, so less goes into pension savings as its based on a percentage of earnings, and we tend to do most of the caring.

Everyone sympathised with single mother Dee Dee Blanchard, who spent every moment caring for Gypsy Rose, a teenager with “the mental capacity of a seven-year-old”. Confined to a wheelchair almost her entire le, her daughter suffered from leukaemia , asthma, muscular dystrophy, learning dficulties and paraplegia, according to Dee Dee. She also had to be fed through a tube after having her saliva glands removed and her teeth fall out from seizure medications. Whenever they went out, the mother had to carry her oxygen tank and feeding tube.    Andthat weren’t enough suffering, the family had been left with nothing after Hurricane Katrina, from which the mother and daughter had barely escaped with their lives. Their ordeal, though, had led to an outpouring of support from their community of Springfield, Missouri, charities and celebrities. Habitat for Humanity built them a house with a special wheelchair ramp, while the Make-A-Wish Foundation sent them on an all-expenses-paid trip to Disney World. Country music star Miranda Lambert visited them at their home and, moved by their plight, gave them £, from her personal account. And they met Lord of the Rings actor Elijah Wood, posing with him for a photo. But appearances weren’t what they seemed. The horrying true crime story has now been told in Huluaposs The Act, starring Joey King and Patricia Arquette.    On June , , sherf’s deputies entered Dee Dee’s home and found the motheraposs body, facedown in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. Neighbours had called police after someone hacked into the mother’s Facebook account, and wrote: “That bitch is dead”. More alarming, there was no sign of her daughter, leading to a belief Gypsy Rose had been abducted by her mother’s murderer. The medications she needed to stay alive were found still in the house and a huge manhunt was launched. Officers were at first relieved to find Gypsy Rose in a hotel with her boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn, who she had met online. But what they discovered next was so bizarre it was even more shocking and grotesque than the idea that someone had murdered a loving mother and snatched her severely handicapped daughter. Gypsy Rose wasn’t a child at all but a -year-old adult. And she had never been sick, disabled or confined to a wheelchair. In fact, once her boyfriend had butchered her mother, she had simply stood up from her wheelchair and run out the house with him.  It was actually the mother, not her daughter, who was sick it emerged. Dee Dee suffered from a condition called Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy , a mental disorder where a parent fabricates or induces a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. She had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger, and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, giving her medication she didn’t need and subjecting her to unnecessary surgery, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. The incredible story has now been turned into a true crime mini-series, The Act, starring Patricia Arquette and Joey King. In fact, Gypsy Rose had been trying to escape her abusive, controlling mother for years. Four years earlier, in , she ran away, fleeing from the hospital to a friend’s house. But Dee Dee tracked her down and punished her, taking away her phone, smashing her computer and hitting her with coat hangers.  In a  interview, she said: There are certain illnesses that I knew I didnapost have. I knew that I didnapost need the feeding tube. I knew that I could eat. I knew that I could walk. But I did believe my mother when she said I had leukemia. Gypsy Rose also told police her mother would shave her head to make her look like a chemotherapy patient and convinced medics to remove her saliva glands by using an anaesthetic to numb her gums and make her drool before doctor visits. Tubes were also implanted in her ears to control the ear infections her mother claimed she had. She also claimed thatshe ever said something while in public which showed she was not really sick or mentally impaired, Dee Dee would give her a very tight squeeze - then when the two were alone, would strike her with her hands or a coat hanger. Then, in , she started a secret romance with Nicholas Godejohn, who was six years her senior, after meeting on a Christian dating site.  Soon, they were planning their wedding and naming their future children. Most importantly, Gypsy Rose saw in Godejohn an escape from her controlling mother. In , she convinced her internet boyfriend to murder her mother so they could be together. “I wanted to be free of her hold on me,” she told his trial in . Godejohn drove to Springfield, arriving while Gypsy Rose and her mother were away at a doctors’ appointment. After they had ed and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, she let him into the house, handing him duct tape, gloves and a kne, before hiding in the bathroom and covering her ears so she would not have to hear her mother screaming as he stabbed her to death. Then, they fled to Godejohn’s house is Big Bend, Winconsin, where police caught up to them, and the real specics of the case were unraveled.  In , Gypsy Rose was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to  years in prison. According to her loved ones, Gypsy Rose is actually thriving in prison. Kristy Blanchard, Gypsy Roseaposs stepmother, said in : Despite everything, she still tells me that sheaposs happier now than with her mom. And thatshe had a choice to either be in jail, or back with her mom, she would rather be in jail. In another interview from prison earlier this year she said she felt “like a prisoner” before her mother was killed. She said: “The prison that I was living in before, with my mom, itaposs, like, I couldnapost walk. I couldnapost eat. I couldnapost have friends. I couldnapost go outside, you know, and play with friends or anything.

We had landed. Getting down on to the Moon was less important but, to actually touch your boot into the sand was signicant. It took much longer to depressurise the cabin than we anticipated. When we got the cabin pressure down to a very low psi – it took ­something like two hundred pounds of pressure to open that up. So we had to wait until we got to a very low pressure dference between the inside of the door and the outside of the door before it would break free. When I first exited the Lunar Module out on to the porch, Buzz [Aldrin] turned on a circuit breaker powering the camera. I asked Houstonthey were getting a picture and they said yes, but it was upside down. I’m at the foot of the ladder. The surface appears to be very fine grained as you get close to it. It’s almost like a powder. The ground mass is very fine. I’m going to step off the Lunar Module now... “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”  I didn’t think about what I was going to say until after landing. I didn’t have confidence in our ability to get down safely, so I didn’t bother thinking about it under after we had landed. Once on the surface and realising that the moment was at hand, fortunately I had hours to think about it. I thought, ‘Well, when I step off, it’s just going to be a little step’. But then I thought about all those , people that had given me the opportunity to make that step and thought, ‘It’s going to be a big something for all those folks and, indeed, a lot of others’. Even so, I have never thought that I picked a particularly enlightening statement. It was a very simple statement. Stepping on the Moon was special, but it was only instantaneous because there was work to do. There was a checklist of things we needed to get on with.    I was surprised by a number of things. I was surprised by the apparent closeness of the horizon. And I was surprised that there was no dust when you kicked your boot. Where you don’t have an atmosphere you don’t have any clouds of dust. It has a stark beauty of its own. It’s much like the high desert of the US. It’s dferent, but it’s pretty out here. You generally have the impression of being on a desert-like surface with rather light-coloured hues, yet when you look at the material in your hand you find it’s a charcoal grey. The optical properties on the moon are most peculiar. It’s a brilliant surface in that sunlight. It’s an interesting place to be. There was substantial discussion before the flight on what the flag should be. It was questioned as to whether it should be an American flag or a United Nations flag. I thought the flag should just be draped down, that it should fall down the flagpole like it would be on Earth.  It shouldn’t be made to stand out or put into any rigid framework, which it ultimately was. We had dficulty getting it into the surface. It ran into the sub-surface crust. Then they said there was a phone call for me, and it was the President of the United States who was speaking from his office from the White House. I didn’t know it was going to be the President. A very nice congratulatory message from the President on behalf of everyone who had been working on the project. And that was a very pleasant surprise. And again there was work to be done, so get back to the job. NASA officials limited our surface working time to two and three quarter hours on that first surface exploration to assure that we would not expire of hyperthermia. We were operating in a near perfect vacuum.  The temperature was well above  degrees Fahrenheit, with the local gravity only one sixth that of Earth. Because normal air conditioning is inadequate for lunar conditions, we were required to use cold water to cool the interior of our suits. There was just far too little time to do the iety of things that we would have liked to have done. There were rocks in the boulder field that were three to four feet in size, very likely pieces of the lunar bedrock. It would have been very interesting to go over and get some samples of those. It would have been nice from our point of view to have had more time to ourselves so that we could have gone out and looked around a little bit.  The ascent to the Colombia command module had a characteristic unlike any other portion of the flight. The rockets would fire and move the vehicle upward then they would shut off, and we would be pushed the other way, then they would kick in again. The whole thing was like a rocking chair through the entire ascent trajectory. It’s a pretty spectacular ride.Watch  Days: To The Moon And Back on BBC iPlayerConspiracy theory More than  million people around the world watched the live televised footage of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walking on the Moon. Since then, NASA has brought back kg of Moon rock, while in  the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter found the footprints left behind. Yet a poll found that % of Americans think it was staged. Conspiracy theories began in  when American Bill Kaysing published a pamphlet entitled We Never Went to the Moon: America’s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle. He argued that the Moon landing was staged in a studio. NASA and other experts have debunked the myths. But hoax stories continued, encouraged in popular culture.

I know what I have here and I work well with the staff.“I know how big a club this is and I am really happy to be here.“And what is important for me is I want to be one of those players who go in the history books of this club and say he was one who got promotion for the team.“I want to improve and learn every week. As a team I think we got better last season as the games continued and I think I got better as a goalkeeper.“We want to keep doing that this year and,we do, we will get back to where we want to be.“Everybody knows where this club belongs and everybody wants to be part of achieving that ultimate goal of getting promoted.“That’s a big point of incentive and motivation for all the players.”Siegrist admits a bonus for him as he ed to work last week was teaming up again in training with fellow-goalie Deniz Mehmet.He was at United until January and has ed with a view to signing up again.“We crossed paths before when we were younger, at international tournaments with Switzerland and Turkey.“Coming from clubs down south we also faced each other. We are competing for the same place but there is always the goalkeepers’ union that means we stick together and it is nice to be working every day with someone you like.”Very much one for looking forward, Siegrist refuses to dwell too long on the disappointing end to last term that saw United again miss out on promotion in the play-offs.And when he does look back, he takes the positives.“I think what happened last year is part of our motivation for this year but I don’t want to speak too much about it because we start from zero again for a new season.“You do every year. In terms of experience it is good that we have had big games, big occasions together and that will help us.“It is like money in the bank but this season is about doing it consistently and picking up points over the whole of the year.”Tonight sees the start of a busy weekend when the entire squad will be involved in a friendly at Brechin before heading for Dumbarton tomorrow to do it all again.Two games in less than  hours may seem unusual but, for Siegrist, it will be the perfect way to prepare for the start of the competitive action in the Betfred Cup at Hearts next week.“So far as fitness goes we are good and game time is the most valuable time you have as a player,” he added.“You can train all week butyou don’t have a game at the end of it you are not bringing everything you’ve worked on together.“It is good to have as many games as we can so we are looking forward to these two games.“There is a lot more to football than passing and running, so game time is the most valuable part of pre-season.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1f65c9b0ea97.81254145-883x564.jpg ","title":"blether whistler jimmy was refereeing amateur games at the age of 80","story":"Kenneth Brannan said he enjoyed the “absolutely brilliant article about my cousin, John Gourlay, which was submitted by John’s pal from boyhood, Gerry Cavanagh .”He continued: “As a schoolboy, John, who is  months older than me, was a great footballing prospect, but, sadly, for whatever reason, he didn’t quite get that vital break.“He ended up, very successfully, taking up a dferent type of career altogether.“John’s late father, James Gourlay , was also a remarkable and,I may say so, a wonderful person.“My Uncle Jimmy was very well known in and around Dundee for many years as a political figure and an equally well-known football referee.“Sadly, he passed away in .“In fact, Uncle Jimmy may well have set a record as a referee because, believe it or not, he continued to referee amateur matches until after his th birthday.”Kenneth remembers playing in a match officiated by his uncle.He continued: “That occurred just once and that was over  years ago when my team Tay Centre played a Sunday league match at Fairmuir.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

from the UK Government, the Scottish Government and five councils that represent the region were in Peebles on Monday to sign the Heads of Terms for investment of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal.The deal is seeking to attract tourists to the area and boost business, and is the result of collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up to pound million in the Borderlands Deal.ldquoThis is an ambitious approach to cross-border working between Governments, local authorities and partners which will boost economic growth by helping existing business, encouraging new ventures and bringing a wealth of improvements to people who live and work in the area and to visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost parts of England operate as a single economic area and it is important the border is not allowed to become an obstacle to development.South Scotland Labour MSP and Scottish Labourrsquos Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Connectivity and Transport, Colin Smyth, has welcomed the news but warned that the Borderlands deal will not provide a quick fix for the challenges facing the region.He said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous praise for developing the projects and getting to this stage, given that many people predicted it would be impossible to bring councils from across the border together in this way.ldquoEveryone now needs to get on with delivering the projects.ldquoThis will not be a panacea for the regionrsquos massive economic challenges.ldquoIt works out at around poundm a year over ten years for the whole of the south of Scotland

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amIt#s the penultimate day of competition at the NatWest International Island Games in Gibraltar and Orkney#s athletes are again in action in a multitude of sports.

I anticipate resistance that they inevitably face, not only politically, but the spite and anger aimed at women’s general visbility, played out in online readers’ comments, social media posts, and antagonistic media framings that dfer remarkably little in their intent to shame and belittle. Headlines and captions can be subtly hostile from the off, drawing on words with gendered, demeaning stereotypes: cat fight, slapped down.Recently though a few particular stars have shown up their critics by pressing on regardless, refusing to linger at stumbling blocks of self-justication demanded of them. They know they won’t win over those holding retrograde views of women and so don’t even bother, instead publicly laughing them off and continuing. It’s a defiance that makes their detractors appear all the more irrelevant, and relies on media savvy and knowing their true audience is looking on.For all social media can focus the lens of hatred, it’s also where contemporary stars across sport, politics, and entertainment communicate with audiences directly, and the audience with one another. When the USA national women’s football team get a hard time from many quarters, their strategy in dealing with it is knowing others are taking inspiration. Like our team in Scotland rising to new prominence, these footballers have won many new fans nationwide. A strong contingent among that are the women and LGBT communities who see them winning and being defiant in the face of familiar attack on the world stage, and, crucially, having a good time while they’re at it. You can join the party or stay under the bridge shouting at women moving on by.: How artists can defeat the politics of hate – Laura Waddell: Donald Trump cleared  Don’t be so sure – Laura WaddellTimes may be slow to change in many quarters, but a palpable new buoyancy comes from the groundswell of support and celebration social media has made visible, cheering on successes but also that defiance itself. We share everything online, sometimes ill-advisedly, but small pockets also share experiences and feelings, building community. Seeing, for example, Megan Rapinoe celebrate after a goal collectively feels good not only for football fans but for the queer people and feminists among them who have grouped together in mutual admiration and recognition. Rapinoe celebrating with theatrical flair in her now trademark arms-wide pose, a visual ta-da, a bow without the bend, is also a win for self-expression and cultural acceptance, all the more so for doing it in spite of detractors and during Pride Month’s spirit of celebration and protest. The momentum of the Women’s World Cup has gathered speed like a cork popping, the potency of representation mixed in with the adrenaline of high-level sports. For decades, sports audiences and commentators have taken men who smash tennis racquets and scream at referees in their stride. Only during the Women’s World Cup can I remember public discussion, facilitated by media phone-ins, about whether the winners have expressed their delight too confidently, their arms spread too widely. If they can’t stop them, they’ll police their tone. Think pieces have sprung up like mushroom spores about whether celebrating visibly is arrogant. Career controversialists have lined up to stick the boot in. In short, the resistance is ancient: to women taking up too much space, expressing their bodies too freely, moving without shame, and being confident in themselves in public. If John Knox were alive today, he’d be on a sofa, gesticulating about Megan Rapinoe.It was inevitable the thin-skinned Trump would bristle at these women, representing many things his Administration opposes, and particularly Rapinoe, with her history of ‘taking the knee’ in protest during the American national anthem. After the President tweeted “Megan should WIN before she TALKS,” the team responded by criticising Trump’s exclusionary policies, racism, and homophobia. When a Fox team covering the World Cup final from a bar went live, patrons began chanting “F*** Trump”.As much as it has felt radical to see women’s sports celebrated in the mainstream worldwide, and for those sports stars to harness the moment as a protest, it has also felt radical to see women’s happiness on the big screens.Visual symbols matter, and few politicians have made use of them as well as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known by her initials and Twitter handle AOC, with her innate understanding of digital media and intent to turn celebrity into action. She’s shown up, with remarkable ease, attempted smears on her character that however weak, might have caused a less digitally reactive politician to flounder. When a video of her dancing in college was dragged into the public eye, its youthful frivolity used in an attempt to damage serious credibility, she put it in its place with a short clip released on Twitter dancing outside her office. She’s also taken viewers on storytelling journeys while questioning in Congress. A five-minute video of her talking about corruption went viral, despite being full of official ins and outs, because she framed it as a “lightning round” game, playing the role of dodgy dealer trying to game the system in order to show up those who have.AOC’s ease on camera helps. But while there’s a long road ahead of her, and recent polling has shown she might need to invest more time in her constituency to retain support, Ocasio-Cortez’s savvy should serve her well. She’s used media attention to shine a light on political causes, knowing press who’ve snfed her out as a rising star will follow where she goes, whether laudatory or critical. Her recent trip to migrant camps on the US-Mexico border forces others to bear witness.Although we know from the meagre information released by human rights associations and charities that conditions are horric in these camps, now openly being referred to as concentration camps by AOC and others, the tide of public opinion has typically relied on visual prompts when it comes to human rights.Several years ago Amnesty International published a report into digital abuse and its impact on freedom of expression, marking it as a factor in dissuading women from speaking publicly. Hostility takes its toll and not everyone is equipped to rise above it. But the new wave of women stars who very visibly press on in spite of their critics is a strong and impactful message about ignoring, not placating, those stuck in the past, and doing it for each other.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"walk this way falkirk gets named as uk s rambling capital","story":"It was once known as a centre of heavy industry, but the Scottish town of Falkirk has been named Britain#s most walking-friendly neighbourhood after reinventing itself as a haven of green space.The town defeated nine other contenders from across England, Scotland and Wales to win the award, picking up  per cent of the , votes cast by members of the public.Walking charity the Ramblers, which organised the competition, said concerted local efforts had led to the creation of a “remarkable”  miles of well-maintained and signposted paths.

Keith Brown MSP has written to Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill asking him to investigate how a letter he had sent to Mr Walker had ended up in the office of Scottish Conservative MP Luke Graham.The confidential correspondence had raised a constituent’s concerns about the impact of Brexit on their business which relied on EU workers. Mr Brown became aware that his letter had been leaked, after receiving a call from Mr Graham’s office asking for more details.An inquiry has already been conducted by the Department for Exiting the EU’s permanent secretary Clare Moriarty, after an initial complaint by Mr Brown, who found there had been “unauthorised disclosure” of information “by a member of staff”.In her letter Ms Moriarty also said that “appropriate action” had since been taken, but a spokesperson for DExEU refused to detail what that involved.Meanwhile, Mr Graham, whose Westminster constituency of Ochil and South Perthshire overlaps with Mr Brown’s Holyrood constituency of Clackmannanshire and Dunblane, said he believed it was “standard practice” to include the local MP into correspondence which referenced their constituency.The Scotsman understands that Keith Brown has now escalated his complaint and written to Sir Mark Sedwill amid concerns the breaching of confidentiality could be “widespread”.Mr Brown said: “This is a deeply concerning incident which should never have occurred. Constituents raise concerns with their MSPs in complete confidence. It is unacceptable for strict data protection rules to be cast aside for political gain – which appears to have been the motivation here.”He added: “While I welcome the findings of the Permanent Secretary to the Brexit department that an unauthorised disclosure did indeed take place, the case raises more questions than it answers. Just how widespread are these practices  Are Tory ministers regularly ulging confidential information to Tory MPs for political expediency “It demonstrates that the whole Westminster system is completely broken – and that goes right to the heart of the department that is supposed to be handling Brexit.”A spokesperson for DExEU said that the department had “rigorous processes in place to address issues of this sort, and this was dealt with immediately when it came to light.”Mr Graham said he had been “informed” about a constituent issue but he had “received no personal constituent data”. He added: “My office called Keith Brown’s to confirm details and askhis office would give further details about the case so we could support.

Long tailbacks on the flagship crossing have been an unwelcome feature for drivers since it was opened in August . Finishing works will continue beyond the second anniversary of its opening to the public.Tory MSP for mid-Scotland and Fe, Dean Lockhart, said: “These figures provide definitive proof that since it opened, drivers using the Queensferry Crossing have been consistently hampered by delays and restrictions.“The least commuters could have expected from the new crossing was that it would help them get to work on time, but this simply hasn’t been the case.“Instead there have been consistent lane closures causing y and consistent delays.“The SNP’s haste and mismanagement when it comes to this project is to blame and they need to explain when they think they will get on top of these issues.”The worst month for hold-ups was May last year when  out of  days were affected by lane restrictions. April of this year saw  days of lane restrictions. The duration of the works have ied from four minutes to  days and there could be more than one restriction in place on one day, according to the figures published by the government website under environmental regulations.A spokesman for national transport agency Transport Scotland said: “Nearly , vehicles use the Queensferry Crossing each day and, since opening, there have been over  occasions when it has remained open when the Forth Road Bridge would have been closed or restricted for HGVs.“The new crossing is delivering clear economic benefits for both industry and commuters, a fact recognised by the road haulage industry.“As is standard on any major trunk road carrying this level of daily traffic, there has been a wide iety of reasons for lane restrictions on the Queensferry Crossing since , including accidents, breakdowns, roadworks and the removal of hazardous items.”The vast majority of lane restrictions for maintenance works are outside of peak times.It has already been confirmed that work to complete the remaining tasks on the bridge will not be completed until October this year – and builders will not be clear of the crossing until December.Snagging and finishing work on the £.bn bridge between Edinburgh and Fe was originally due to have been completed in September – a year after it opened.

This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form.

The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view.

Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash..."},{"url":null,"title":"yell ferry daggri could be out of service for up to two weeks ","story":" will be taken out of service for up to a fortnight in early July in order for essential mechanical work to be done.According to Shetland Islands Council, inspections during the recent annual refit had highlighted an issue with the shaft bearings between each main engine and the propulsion thrusters.Parts were not available at that time and the vessel would now need to be taken out of service to carry out the repairs, which could take up to two weeks..Bookings and timetable on the route would operate as normal but with a reduced capacity for vehicles, the SIC said, apologising for any inconvenience caused. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

Indeed, and purely coincidentally, Ken left Uganda just before Amin’s reign of terror began.He was -years-old and looking after a region the size of Northern Ireland.He moved to Kenya and worked there for six years with Sir Alexander Gibb and Partner, a London based consultancy: “I was involved in the construction of hundreds of kilometres of roads.

There was just a great feel about the place, it just felt right for us.”“The best decision we ever made was to buy a house and settle here. I met Canon Noble Hamilton who took me under his wing.”Canon Hamilton encouraged Rev Quinn to go for ordination and the two became firm friends: “Probably because of our mutual love of rugby.” Of the other rectors at Seapatrick he also fondly remembered John Scott and his we Laura: “He was here about  years and we got on extremely well, we are lelong friends.”Having been commissioned as lay reader in , Rev Quinn was ordained as auxiliary minister at Sepatrick Parish in , one of the firstappointments to the new auxiliary role within the Church of Ireland.During his retirement sermon on Sunday he said he and his we loved Banbridge and had no intention of leaving the town.”He went on: “When one passes three score years and ten one tends to look back rather than forward. This is only natural, I suppose.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"limited sharing of brexit information shows uk total indifference to northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It suggested communication between the department in Northern Ireland and officials in London was not adequate. \"Northern Ireland officials have limited visibility of Brexit information even in areas that are critical to Northern Ireland interests,\" the review said.It went on to say as the original March Brexit deadline approached communication improved.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said the revelations showed \"the total lack of concern in London regarding the impact on people here\".“Despite the fact that the north will be hardest hit by this disastrous policy, we continue to see London’s total indference and disregard for the consequences of Brexit in Ireland.“We are being driven toward a disastrous no deal Brexit. In that eventuality the British Government needs to act in line with the Good Friday Agreement and announce a referendum to give people the option of remaining in the EU through Irish reunication.”A DAERA spokesman said it had an \"excellent working relationship\" with its colleagues in London."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast teens flying high as princes trust offers opportunity to be pilots","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He made the comments after the government published an updated #Brexit preparedness plan @PA pic tcqpNI— Michelle DevaneJuly , “It will make it more dficult for the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement toand it will be a fundamental disruptor to the all island economy as it s today seamlessly,” he said.“There is no sugar coating of that message. For people living in border counties and in Northern Ireland, this will be really dficult.“In a no-deal scenario, while we will prevent physical infrastructure, undoubtedly the imposition of tarfs and the need to protect the integrity of the single market, to keep Ireland in the single market that we have been part of creating, will provide a disruption to the all-island trade which is something that we will all work intensively to avoid.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Tanaiste Simon Coveney Mr Coveney told the media that the “overarching theme” of the document is a stark message that there is no good news in a no-deal Brexit for Ireland, Northern Ireland or the UK.“This will be a very, very dficult issue for Ireland to deal with but this document is about mitigating where we can the negative impacts of that scenario should it unfold,” he continued.The -page document states that a crash Brexit would pose “unique and unprecedented” challenges for the UK, the EU and Ireland.The extensive report further states that a no-deal would be an exercise in damage limitation and it would also be “impossible” to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across a full range of sectors.It also found that a no-deal Brexit will have severe negative impacts in a number of sectors and among smaller and medium-sized businesses, and it will be widely felt on a regional basis.It also warned of signicant job losses in the most exposed sectors in a no-deal scenario, with an estimated increase in unemployment of -, after the UK leaves the EU.It further said that tarfs and checks and controls on UK imports will be disruptive to trade across the Irish Sea.The report also said that the consequences of the UK crashing out of the EU could be “very damaging” for the political process in Northern Ireland.“If the institutions are not in place at the time of a no-deal Brexit, there is a risk that the UK Government might initiate a move to Direct Rule in Northern Ireland as a response to managing the sht to new post-Brexit arrangements,” the report added.“A no-deal Brexit will have profound implications for Ireland on all levels.“These implications involve severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral challenges.“Notwithstanding mitigation measures in place, potential disruption to daily le in areas such as online retail purchases from the UK, access to medicines, and medical devices, and financial services sourced from the UK.”Mr Coveney continued: “We will need to take some action somewhere in our economy to ensure that we are protecting the integrity of the products that are then going to be sold on out of Ireland but we are not going to put checks on the border or close to it.”He said Ireland needs to make sure the integrity of single market is protected and that a situation does not arise where there is an “unguarded backdoor” through Northern Ireland into the EU single market which would “in effect take Ireland out of the single market against our will”.“We as a government can’t allow that to happen and won’t allow it to happen,” he added.Mr Coveney said that, personally, he does think the UK will crash out of the EU on October .“I’m not a gambler, it’s just as well with Brexit,” he added.“It’s a very real risk now and we need to be prepared for it in a very real way.“One of the warnings I’ve given this week to businesses is that we can’t suffer from the boy who cried wolf mentality here.“We’ve had a number of occasions where we’ve been marched to the top of the hill and then all of a sudden there’s been an extension.“And anybody who assumes that somehow someone is going to pull a rabbit out of a hat between now and October I think is being very naive. People need to prepare for all Brexit outcomes.“Others have suggested that there’s some evil plan on a shelf somewhere that can be implementednecessary. There isn’t.”He said that discussions between Ireland and the European Commission are continuing.He continued: “We’re designing solutions here in very dficult circumstances with this dual responsibility we have towards peace and good relations and at the same time protecting Ireland’s economy and keeping us in the single market and customs union. And the European Commission is helping us to do that.“But we know that in the build up to October, this time it’s for real, and we will need answers to these awkward questions.”He said it was why the backstop was such a “clever solution to this dficult issue”."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A spot-check on one wing found % of prisoners locked up during the day.“HMP Manchester was relatively well resourced and had fewer inexperienced staff than we have found at similar prisons. It was therefore hard to understand why progress had been so slow in many critical areas.“Such progress as there had been had only started in the weeks and months immediately leading up to this review visit,” he said.“Without a fundamental sht in attitude towards the findings of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, we had no confidence that there could be signicant improvements in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"giraffe takes first wobbly steps at us zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He then drove back home and picked up his we Phyllis, collected his mother and father-in-law and drove to Buncrana where they played a round of Pitch and Putt. The family then asked looked around the Inishowen town for holiday accommodation for later in the summer before ing to Derry.That evening, they all had a fry for their supper and then Sammy drove his mother and father-in-law home before ing to William Street again. Sammy watched television until midnight and headed for bed about .am. Mrs Devenny followed him up around .am and recalled that Sammy “was in the best of form.”As she got into bed Phyllis said Sammy said “oh dear” and was panting and wheezing. She wasted no time in calling a priest and a doctor and her neighbour Mrs Myra Doherty. When Fr Mulvey and Fr McCullough arrived, Mrs Devenny left the room.  Sammy Devenny died around .am on July , just as Dr Clarke arrived at the house.Mr Devenney’s remains were formally identied by his son Harry and the Post Mortem examination was carried out by State Pathologist Dr TK Marshall on the day of the death.The cause of death was established as coronary atheroma and old thrombosis. The central question surrounding the death of Sammy Devenny has always been whether it was caused by the injuries sustained during the RUC assault.When conducting the Post Mortem examination it was noted by Dr Marshall that in , Mr Devenney had complained to his doctor of aches in his left shoulder and lower left side and the back of his chest but nothing sinister had been found at that time.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAs a result the Pathologist did not state that the death had been caused the injuries taken during the attack. Also, Dr Pantridge at the Royal Victoria Hospital believed that death occurred from natural causes and the assault was not a contributory factor.And, Dr Vine, Consultant at Altnagelvin agreed with the others and suggested thatthe heart attack was the result of the attack by the RUC it probably would have occurred immediately.But, Dr Clarke, partner in the practice of Dr Kinsella, the Devenny family’s practice said that the assault on Sammy Devenny and his children and the acute nervous tension arising from contributed to the heart attack.The Inquest into the death of Sammy Devenny was opened on July ,  and was conducted by Coroner MF Leslie who recorded that: “The jury, having heard all the evidence and in accordance with the medical evidence placed before them,a verdict of death by natural causes.”By occupation, Sammy Devenny was an undertaker and hearse driver for the firm of McClafferty and Sons in Derry. He was regarded by everyone as a quiet and mild-mannered man and had never been involved in any political agitation.Newspaper reports recorded that his funeral was one of the largest the city had ever seen and was attended by an estimated , people.CAPTION: The remains of Sammy Devenny being carried past his home in William Street."},{"url":null,"title":"welshpool hand cyclist takes land s end john o groats charity","story":"Andrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"last call hunt champions businesses powys","story":"Powys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Pictured is Cllr Rosemarie Harris .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Pictured front left to right, Cllr Martin WealeCeri StephensBeverley Blt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsBiz awards logo\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsITVrsquos Coast  Country TV presenter Andrew Price will be presenting thiltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgts yearrsquos Powysltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Business Awards.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/10115476.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Get involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewslettersNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.On the afternoon of June , , , young people mdash aged between  and  mdash assembled at Delamont to finally pull the largest megalith in the United Kingdom and Ireland into place.Over the preceding months, the volunteers, recruited from schools and youth groups from all over Northern Ireland, had attended numerous training sessions in preparation for the event..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch student has a royal date with duchess  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager who battled mental health issues celebrated his th birthday with the ultimate party mdash a date with the Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.Cathal McCann, who attends St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, was invited to the palace after he was helped through a mental health crisis by Action for Children Northern Irelandrsquos Blues Programme.His mum, Mandy, said: ldquoHe wouldnrsquot even be here todayit wasnrsquot for Action for Children so to celebrate by meeting Duchess Kate is the icing on the cake.ldquoHe was very low and even self-harming.

They soon had the home side in trouble at  for in the tenth over, Stuart Campbell doing the damage, taking  for  runs in his five overs, ably supported by Corey McGuire, bowling his five overs for  runs.Bangor rallied at this point with some big hitting from their lower order batsmen, finally reaching a total of  runs in their  overs.Down High went into bat in reply with Stuart Campbell and Christy Lindsay opening the batting. Both batsmen set about the task in a positive manner with Campbell especially hitting out.Lindsay was eventually bowled for  runs and that brought Conor Moag to the wicket, scoring a quick seven, getting out to a good catch. Joe Dooley was next in and he batted steadily until Stuart Campbell got out for an excellent  runs scored.This then brought Charlie Hutton to the wicket.

That is why we have arranged tonightrsquos meeting and I hope it will be well supported by the people of Downpatrick, across the district and further afield.Mr Morgan claimed many people he has spoken to want change and have an appetite for a new Assembly comprising independent members, not established political party representatives.He continued: ldquoTonightrsquos meeting is the next stage in the campaign and we are approaching this on a county by county basis. We are inviting all politicians and those interested in politics to join us in the Arts Centre which many will know as the old town hall.ldquoWe are keen to see independent politicians joining us as we aim to set up a civilian Assembly. We remain in a state of emergency in this country. The new political system we have in mind will be outlined tonight.Labelling the day of silent solidarity as a ldquohuge success, Mr Morgan hopes to build on the increasing momentum for what he and others are attempting to achieve.He added: ldquoRather than talk about doing something, we believe that action is stronger than words and that there is a consensus for political change and politicians who want to work together for everyonersquos benefit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Eimear’s five marathons in five days  ","story":"LOUGHINISLANDrsquoS Eimear Murray has never completed one marathon mdash yet she is aiming to do five in five days as part of a charity challenge.The super fit  year-old gaelic footballer is doing five lsquomarathonsrsquo in running, swimming, rowing and cycling, starting on September .She aims to raise money for two causes close to her heart mdash Daisy Lodge in Newcastle andlittle Katie Rose McKeown, from Armagh, in her ongoing fight against cancer.Eimear will be running two marathons of . miles ndash one at the beginning and another end of her five days.She will also be doing marathon times or distances in the other three sports mdash a km cycle run, a km swim and . miles on a rowing machine.Her uncle, Ciaran Carolan, will be accompanying her on the cycle run and some of her team-mates have promised to run some sections on her last marathon run.She hopes to do the row either in the club or somewhere public where passers-by will be able to watch and hopefully donate money as she works up a sweat.Eimear plays at left back for Loughinisland ladies mdash who are unbeaten in the last  games and winners of Down Junior League at the weekendmdash and she says that a rash statement one night has now turned into a major physical challenge.ldquoIrsquove never run a marathon before, but I finished a -mile practice run last week so training is going well, said Eimear. ldquoIrsquove taken part in a few half marathons but that is the extent of my running.ldquoThis happened when I mentioned it as an idea to some friends.

He also pointed out that gold was more common in Ireland during the Bronze Age than in most other parts of Europe.The jury concluded that the fastener had been intentionally hidden or concealed and therefore declared it treasure trove.Although young Elizabeth is likely to receive compensation for discovering the fastener, the coroner ruled that it becomes the property of the Queen and will be handed over to the Treasury.ARDGLASS mdash A verdict of death by misadventure was recorded on a  year-old man whose body was found washed up at Ardglass in February this year after the boat on which he was fishing sank.An inquest jury at Downpatrick on Thursday heard how James Edward Greer, of Elmfield Park, Donaghadee, had been held up in the water for about  minutes by his skipper, who eventually had to let go of him.The badly decomposed body of Mr Greer, who could not swim, was washed up at Sheepland Begg on February .The skipper of the boat said he held the deceased for about five minutes after their vessel was hit by a big wave off Peel in the Isle of Man.He tried to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but Mr Greer was unconscious and after another ten minutes he had to get him go because he himself was in danger.

The scheme was originally due to complete at the end of March.Signicant problems which delayed the scheme which the government department described as ldquounforeseen works issues included the discovery of asbestos piping by BT Openreach along both sides of Irish Street, delaying progress by eight weeks.Contractors also encountered problems with the foundations of the old blast wall at the former PSNI station and part of the Irish Street sewerage network.While traders were fully supportive of the regeneration scheme, they expressed anger that the project took more than twice as long to complete than originally planned and that they were not better informed by the government department.In addition, many have expressed surprise at the design of the scheme which has resulted in the narrowing of one of the townrsquos main streets at its junction with John Street and a loss of parking spaces.A number of traders have also questioned why a second footpath has been provided on one side of Irish Street given one was already in place.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said traders, shoppers and residents will be pleased that Irish Streetrsquos two-way traffic flow has been reinstated and hoped that ldquovaluable lessons will have been learned by all those involved with the public realm scheme.Ahead of work on a planned upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction in Downpatrick, which is due to start shortly, he also hopes businesses and residents affected by the work will be provided with regular updates.Five roads converge at the busy junction where roads officials plan to upgrade traffic signals and introduce a new one-way system in Lower Stream Street.The Killough Road merges with Pound Lane, Stream Street, Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue with Cllr Curran hoping disruption will be kept to a minimum.ldquoGiven the nature of this particular junction and the huge volume of traffic it handles on a daily basis, disruption is inevitable, he said.ldquoWhile it is important that road users remain patient and obey any temporary traffic flows which may be in place, roads officials must keep people informed.Cllr Curran added: ldquoWhat happened in Irish Street must not and cannot be repeated. Lessons have surely been learned and keeping people better informed must be the priority.ldquoThe Collinsrsquo Corner upgrade is vital and I hope that once this scheme has been completed a lsquoserious lookrsquo will be taken at addressing the congestion problem in nearby Edward Street which is a major health and safety issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Lynch excels at Spelga race  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ACrsquos Seamus Lynch won race seven of the NIMRA Championship, which took place at Spelga Dam on Saturday,, the aptly named Spelga Skyline.Typical Mourne weather of passing showers and fog did not deter the  entries.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local authorityrsquos Good Relations Forum, with Sinn Feinrsquos Mickey Ruane in agreement.Cllr Ruane said he was respectful of the motion Cllr Hanna and his party had tabled, suggesting the Good Relations Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a shamrock, suggesting that they could perhaps be offered the chance of being awarded this or a poppy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New civic amenity centre set to open in Downpatrick  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new civic amenity centre is scheduled to open later this month.The new site at the Flying Horse Road on the outskirts of the town will replace the nearby Cloonagh Road facility which has been struggling for some time to keep pace with increasing demand.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is building the new centre which is larger than the current facility and will be able to handle considerably more waste.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Thatched cottages were once a common feature in NI in  about k were thought to survive, but today only around  of those historic homes remain. ldquoThatrsquos a remarkable loss of our heritage and in living memory too. I want to do something to highlight that loss and try to find a solution for this thatched building.ldquoIt is an important building as one of only  surviving thatched buildings in NI. It has stood empty since the s but the church who own it are trying to find a viable future for it before it is too late and itrsquos loss would have an awful impact in the village. ldquoAs it stands at the heart of Kilmore we hope it can help to regenerate the character, core and community of what is an historic little village, but it has a signicant conservation deficit owing to its listed status and the specialised nature of the work it will need to do it justice, as a building of special architectural and historic interest. ldquoAs such, Irsquom running km to try and raise some money for the church to undertake a viability study to identy the use which will attract the funding and have the outputand outcomeswhich we hope to achieve for the village and wider community. ldquoAs such we are welcoming suggestions from the local community on what it might be turned in to and also it would be great to see what people out there in the local area know of its history.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.
