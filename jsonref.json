The Department of Education, irrespective of whatever minister is in charge, is generally more cautious and conservative than other government departments and teacher unions tend to resist radical change as well.And yet change – often led by schools and teachers themselves – is happening.One of the most notable initiatives in Irish education, DCU Changemaker Schools Network, which is run from the university’s institute of education, is holding a conference on innovative schools in Ireland on March 24th.“The pandemic has revealed the fault lines in traditional education systems and created an opportunity to reimagine education for 21st century learning,” says Fiona Collins, network co-ordinator of the DCU Changemaker Schools Network.Collins has been seconded to the DCU School of Policy Practice from her role as principal of Francis Street School, which is part of the network.“We support schools to network and foster the skills of empathy, creativity, leadership and teamwork,” Collins explains.“We support teachers and students in areas such as student voice, agency and participation as well as social innovation and active and engaged citizenship to address societal challenges such as inequality, climate change and mental health, assisting teachers and schools too.”Here, we profile just some of the schools involved in the initiative:During the pandemic, we all sought ways to make the most of the outdoors and, for many of us, that shift has become permanent.Scoil Bhríde in Shantalla – a Deis school just 15 minutes from the shores of Galway Bay and the docklands in Galway city – set up a “sea school” during the pandemic to ensure the children could avail of the amenities on their doorstep and get outside while still being within their five kilometres.Students here learn about marine life and conservation, marine biology, rigging and water safety, the effects of climate change and the skills of seafaring, sailing and fishing. They also learn about the history of traditional crafts and how to build a traditional fishing boat and they catch their own fish before cooking and eating it.It’s a hands-on, experiential approach that touches on areas of the curriculum including science, geography, history, art and maths.The school has also become a dyslexia-friendly school which focuses on the talents and strengths of the students as well as addresses the emotional complexities of dyslexia, with creativity in all disciplines as well as an emphasis on coding, self-esteem and emotional wellbeing.Empathy is one of the core values of the DCU Changemaker initiative, and the school has put inclusion at its core.“In November 2014 we established our first autism early-intervention class for preschool children, and we now have two early-intervention and four school-age classes,” says teacher Louise Redington.“Inclusion of autism-spectrum pupils with the mainstream is important to us, and the establishment of our autism centre has enhanced the learning experiences, empathy skills and social awareness of each and every member of our school community.”Student and teacher leadership at the school is fostered with an active student council.One of the suggestions from the children in the student council – to build an outdoor classroom made of recycled materials – was taken up, increasing the amount of outdoor learning, including growing vegetables in a polytunnel.Last summer, they were crowned “Incredible Edibles” champion after producing a bumper crop and successfully hatching chickens. As part of all this, the children learn about farm safety.“The teachers lead by example in how they act, speak and behave, and take on leadership roles in and out of the classroom,” says Redington. “Changemaker schools means we show empathy, creativity, teamwork and leadership in all we do.”No stranger to radical change, the school was the first to break the Irish norm of religiously controlled education school principal Miriam Hurley says they are constantly open to innovation.“In 2015, one of our teachers brought the idea of a forest school and, because Changemaker schools are open to listening to anyone with a good idea, we took it on.“We take the children out in all weather bar storms, and our families know to dress them for all weathers. It’s a very structured initiative that involves team games at the start, then free play within boundaries, and relaxation time.“We’ve had Halloween events, tea ceremonies, storytelling and inspiration from nature drawn from Irish folklore, and teamwork is a vital part of it all. There is huge creativity in it, with children using blackberries to make dye and landscape art, all the while learning about camouflage, sliding, hills and trees. They don’t even notice that they’re learning.”The school also places an emphasis on empathy, using restorative practices as part of its anti-bullying programme. This involves a teacher listening to both children in a dispute before bringing them together to hear each other.“Getting to know other Changemaker schools has been inspirational,” says Hurley. “While it can be a challenge to operate in an under-resourced education system, it is affirming to see children growing into critical thinkers and problem-solvers.”Our Lady’s and St Mochua’s, ArmaghThe only Northern Irish school in the DCU Changemaker initiative, this school places an emphasis on entrepreneurship.“For us, it means being open-minded and willing to embrace change,” says principal Gary Farrell.But, ultimately, Farrell says, DCU Changemakers means that every child takes on leadership roles, whether on their eco-committee or the pupil leadership team.They have adopted Roots of Empathy, an internationally acclaimed programme which sees children get to know a newborn baby whose parent brings them to the school over the course of a year and which has been proven to build up empathy.“Creativity is key too, and we’ve developed this in our children through digital storytelling and animation,” says Farrell. “Ultimately, all of these skills are what children need for adulthood.”Opening in 2006, St Ultan’s is a one-of-a-kind education and social care campus.“We’ve developed a system of integrated care and education through which our eclectic team – which includes teachers, special-needs assistants, social care workers, early-years practitioners, therapeutic staff and a wide range of service providers from each part of our campus – meet to discuss the needs of our children and collaborate on which responses we can offer,” says Gary Jones, school principal and campus manager.“This is not the typical way of working in Irish schools or youth services but the benefits greatly outweigh the challenges of developing a new model of working.“Most children arrive as infants and we get to know them and their families and provide the supports they need to flourish as they grow into toddlers and transition across the hall to the primary school. No child here needs to be hungry or lacking in confidence, and we cook meals on site as well as offer a range of additional activities including sport and music.”Despite its small size, this two-teacher school in west Cork has big ambitions when it comes to creative projects.The two classrooms much of spent the school year separated from each other due to Covid-19 restrictions.However, the school staff came up with an innovative project that would allow the students to work together while staying apart – a mural of plastic bottletops.Pupils, staff and the wider community collected some 12,000 bottle tops to create a mural of their community which stands at 24ft by eight feet.The mural shows the view from the playground of Ballineen Bridge with Enniskeane village and Ballineen village on either side. It features some of the wildlife in the area such as herons and swans.This mural, which turned rubbish into art, shows how a project can evolve even during lockdowns and how to be creative during a time of great challenge in schools."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"In Richard Nairn\u0026rsquos second book on the Irish coastline, he has bad news to shareStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"realistic achievable necessary mary lou mcdonald pushes eu to back irish reunification","story":"Mary Lou McDonald  on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, on St Patrick’s Day. The centrality of the question of reunification in the newsletter is similar to messages imparted by Ms McDonald on visits to the US. Photograph:  PA Wire Sinn Féin has told EU diplomats that Europe must prepare for change as Irish reunification has moved “centre stage”.In a party-produced European Newsletter which has been sent to foreign diplomats in Dublin, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald argues that unification has never been so widely discussed before.“It is being talked about in every town and city in Ireland, not in aspirational tones but as a realistic, achievable and necessary future.”Ms McDonald says the European Union must respond in the same way it took positions on the reunification of Germany and has a stance on the issue in Cyprus. “Our European partners must be energetic and proactive in advocating for Irish unity at every opportunity.”Diplomatic sources say Sinn Féin has an outreach effort to embassies in Dublin outmatching that of other political parties. Last December, Sinn Féin’s international department organised an online briefing for Dublin-based diplomatic representatives with Ms McDonald, and the party’s foreign affairs spokesman, John Brady. Another briefing for the diplomatic community was run last July on the Irish protocol and recent developments in Northern Ireland. The centrality of the question of reunification in the newsletter is similar to messages imparted by Ms McDonald on visits to the United States. Last year, she told the New York City Bar Association that people were living in the “dying days” of partition.An article by MEP Chris MacManus calls on the EU to “get off the sidelines” and also to make clear what supports “financial or otherwise, it is prepared to offer to assist with a smooth transition towards a re-united Ireland”. ‘Crucial role’A Sinn Féin spokesman said the international community had played a “crucial role” in the peace process and the party had engaged in an intensive programme of political engagement and outreach for decades. This had included engagements with embassies in Dublin, London, the US and EU, he said.“In recent times it has been important to deal with the diplomatic community on issues like the impact of Brexit, the implementation of the protocol, the future of politics on our island and the opportunity that now exists for Irish reunification.”Taoiseach Micheál Martin has repeatedly pushed back against calls for a referendum on Irish unity in the short term, and has promoted the Government’s Shared Island Dialogues at international level while stressing the importance of reconciliation.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sunny weather to continue with temperatures of 17 degrees forecast","story":"Walking the dog at King’s Inns Park, Dublin, on Monday.

introducing toll roads for motorists as a way for the Treasury to bring in more money with Chancellor Rishi Sunak set to slash fuel dutyThe government is looking at introducing road tolls, it is reported Image: Alamy Stock PhotoByTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsDrivers could face tolls on British roads as the government looks at ways to bring in more money with fuel duty expected to be cut, it is reported.Chancellor Rishi Sunak is likely to reduce the duty on fuel for the first time in over a decade when he makes his spring statement but at the same time ministers are looking at ways to bring in new ways to tax drivers. He has hinted he may cut fuel duty by up to p per litre, with forecourt prices soaring since Russia aposs invasion of Ukraine.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has also backed the move - and repeated calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to drive down soaring energy bills.But with the continual growth of electric cars it also means that less money will be made from the fuel tax.  While toll roads are common place in many European countries, in the UK the biggest toll roads include the M near Birmingham where drivers have an alternative and it costs £. for cars during the week, as well as £. for HGVs, to use the road. The option for road tolls is now to be taken very seriously a government source told The Times. They said: “It’s definitely being taken very seriously in Downing Street. The policy unit is giving it a thorough look and the problems with fuel duty now make it more urgent.” Another option which has been recommended by the cross-party Commons transport committee is for monitoring technology that would charge drivers a fee for the distance they have gone but there are fears that there could be a backlash to this especiallyit is introduced in towns and cities. The government is working at options with petrol and diesel cars being phased out and it is estimated that without them in  then the Treasury would be losing £ billion.  With the cost of living crisis, more than  Conservative MPs are calling for a cut in the tax to reduce the price of petrol and diesel. Sunak has warned he cannot fully protect Brits from the rising costs, but heaposs expected to reduce the duty prices on fuel. Drivers in the UK are currently splashing out .p a litre on fuel - one of the highest levels of tax in the world. More than % of the cost of petrol in the UK is made up of fuel duty and VAT. Former cabinet minister Sir John Redwood said: Taking a bit off petrol and diesel is fine and welcome. Butthataposs all there is it will be too little, too late. We are facing a very big cost of living squeeze. We need to be cutting taxes now to relieve that pressure. The Chancellor needs to back off all the tax rises he was planning. The national insurance rise should not go ahead, we should cut VAT on fuel and cut it on energy saving products like insulation too.

But the House of Lords Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee said the use of emergency powers to bring in the move was “unjustied”. It added the target is “arbitrary” with “no clear means of measuring success”. The Committee brought the law to the “special attention” of the Lords in a rare move, and called on the DWP to report to Parliament on whetherit’s hit the target. The committee blasted: “Extensive additional evidence still left us with the view that the target is aspirational, its delivery not yet fully thought through, and the Department’s ability to say whether its target has been achieved somewhat uncertain.” It said the DWP was unable to explain how it will meet the target or how it will measure it - including whether people taking part-time jobs will still count as an entire job.The new rules have been branded “ridiculous” as they could force people to stage hasty career changes with commutes of up to three hours a day.  The DWP said a claimant would have to take up a job offer evenit was a  minute commute each way to work, or be sanctioned. SNP MP David Linden said last month: “Norman Tebbit callously told people to ‘get on their bike’ to look for work when there was mass unemployment under the Tories in the s.“This ridiculous rule is taking up the Tebbit mantra and forcing people to go miles further or face having their benefits cut.”  A DWP spokesperson previously said the -minute rule has not changed with the introduction of Way to Work. They added: “Work coaches take an inidual’s circumstances and capability into consideration when setting commitments, ensuring they are realistic and achievable.” Charities have warned the “forceful approach” could “create huge amounts of anxiety and stress”. There are also questions about the exact nature of the target.When Boris Johnson announced the scheme he said: “We are launching a plan to get half a million people off welfare and into work.”But despite the PM’s boast, it’s thought the plan is only to get , people into jobs - not off Universal Credit. Millions of Universal Credit claimants also have a job, but it doesn’t pay enough for them to come fully out of the welfare system. Labour peer Lord Rowlands, a member of the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee said: “We remain unconvinced that emergency legislation was necessary which, as a consequence, curtailed proper parliamentary scrutiny of a measure that affects the rights of hundreds of thousands of claimants.“We also remain concerned that the implementation of the plan did not take into account the regional dferences in job vacancies.” A DWP spokesperson said: “This isn’t about sanctioning people – it’s about getting people to consider jobs in other sectors earlier, helping them find work faster.“As has always been the case, people are only sanctionedthey fail, without good reason to meet the conditions which they agreed to, which could include attending a job interview, or completing training, and the latest data shows the sanctions rate remains below pre-pandemic levels. “With a record . million jobs available, it’s right that people who can work, are encouraged to take up available roles.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsSpring StatementNorman TebbitBoris JohnsonLord RowlandsState pensionPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It is understood staff are being replaced with cheaper agency workers. Shortly after the sackings, footage emerged of workers being marched off ships by balaclava-clad security staff in what the RMT union described as one of the most shameful episodes in its recent industrial history. The dispute has led to renewed calls for the Government to strengthen workersapos rights.On Monday night in the Commons, the Labour Party forced a vote on ending fire and rehire practices - which see firms staff to essentially accept the same job for weaker terms and conditions and lower wages - and giving PO workers their jobs back.But MPs on the Government ignored the motion and ministers now face anger. Speaking after the vote, TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Everybody deserves dignity and security at work.  “But the government is once again showing contempt for workers’ rights by failing to back action on fire and rehire. “After the scandalous events at PO have ministers learnt nothing “It is clear to everybody that UK employment law needs dragging into the st Century.“The longer the government delays and does nothing the longer bad bosses will be able to get away with treating staff like disposable labour. “Ministers must urgently bring forward an employment bill to root out exploitative working practices. “And they must put relentless pressure on PO to reinstate all sacked staff.” Sacked PO workers watched in the House of Commons public gallery as MPs voiced fury about the ferry operator, bought by Dubai-based logistics firm DP World in , opting to replace the them with cheaper agency staff. Leading the debate was Shadow Transport Secretary Lou Haigh, who said PO staff spoke movingly about how PO felt like a family, adding. The reward for that loyalty  A summary dismissal via a pre-recorded video. Years of dedication ended with them being marched off the ships they lived and worked on by private security guards. They have a four year old child that they no longer know how they will feed and clothe. They told me, with tears in their eyes, that they felt they’d been treated like criminals.  And It is nothing short of a scandal that this Dubai-owned company – which received millions in taxpayers money during the pandemic – can tear up the rights of British workers. All while their profits soared by % last year. This cannot, it must not stand. We cannot allow British workers, and this country, to be taken for a ride.She told her Government counterpart, Grant Shapps, that the Government should trigger immediate criminal action against the company.The Rail, Maritime and Transport union , which represented many of the  staff fired without notice last week, said their replacements are being paid well below the minimum wage in the UK. General secretary Mick Lynch said: “The news that the seafarers now on ships in British ports are to be paid . dollars an hour is a shocking exploitation of those seafarers and another gut-wrenching betrayal of those who have been sacked. “The rule of law and acceptable norms of decent employment and behaviour have completely broken down beneath the white clfs of Dover and in other ports, yet five days into this national crisis the Government has done nothing to stop it. “These ships of shame must not be allowed to sail. The Government has to step in now and take control before it’s too late.”  The minimum wage in the UK for people aged  and above is £. per hour. But companies using UK ports often register ships in other countries, allowing them to pay lower wages. For example, some vessels operated by PO Ferries are flagged in Cyprus. PO Ferries refused to comment on the pay of agency workers. When the firm informed staff on Thursday they were losing their jobs, it told them it was aiming to halve crewing costs. Mr Shapps confirmed to MPs that PO Ferries could face “criminal prosecution and unlimited fines” over its handling of the redundancies, with the Insolvency Service examining the matter. He went on: “For our part we’re reviewing all Government contracts with PO Ferries as a matter of urgency and with DP World and, where possible, we’re looking to use other providersindeed there are any contracts where the UK Government is involved I believe at this point that they have been historic in nature rather than current. “We’re considering further steps we can take to remove PO Ferries’ influence from British maritime, including positions on any advisory boards because again I don’t want to see that company, with the way the management has behaved, advising the way that British maritime is shaped and rolls out.” Mr Shapps said the Government will “consider” whether it needs to go further on fire and rehire laws.

And she claimed Vladimir Putin could exploit refugee flows to send agents to Britain.In her keynote speech, she said: Iaposve been asked why couldnapost we suspend security checks on people escaping Putinaposs war  Times of conflict, my friends, emphasises our need to remain watchful. I know from the briefings I receive from the intelligence and security services that instability around the world brings with it greater threats.  Only four years ago the Russian military intelligence services used a chemical weapon on British soil. She went on: The truth is that a very small number of people can wreak utter havoc. Russia has a history of covert hostile activity.And Iaposm afraid it is naive and misguided to think that only men can be covert operatives, or that refugee flows could not be subject to some form of exploitation.  Ms Patel went on: There are those who would come to our country, to this country, who mean us harm and who plot to strike at our very way of le. The processes that we have put in place closely follow the advice of our intelligence and security services. They mean we can help Ukrainians in need without making our country less safe. It comes as the Home Office said , visas had been granted under the family scheme for Ukrainians fleeing the war by pm on Friday. Ms Patel added: State threats and terrorism take many forms. They also thrive on indference and appeasement and now we are seeing them bolstered by new types of targeted biological, chemical, cyber warfare, ransomware and online threats. Our duty is to safeguard our countryaposs interests and we will never take our eye off the ball when it comes to the safety and security of our country. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said , places had been created in schools for children fleeing Ukraine and virtual lessons created during the coronavirus pandemic had been translated into Ukrainian. Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove confirmed more than , households had now offered to house Ukrainian refugees, the majority of whom have made their way to Poland. Former prime minister David Cameron announced on Friday he was driving a small lorry to the Polish border with Ukraine with supplies.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON PO FerriesConservative PartyHome OfficeMichael GoveDavid CameronVladimir PutinTerrorismPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And then he wonapost. What heaposll do instead is slice a few pennies off fuel, and while you might think this is a dandy idea all it does is reduce the governmentaposs cut, and leaves the profits to oil companies who may, or may not, decide to lower the price you pay at the pumps.By cutting the cost of petrol and diesel, Rishi Sunak will take money out of the NHS, road repairs, schools, bin collections, social work, home help, and a thousand other things you donapost notice as much as the cost of a full tank, but need in order to survive, just the same.The fact heaposll do it while telling you heaposs making le easier for the average man on the street is a flat lie from someone who is at no risk of ever having to choose between filling up on fuel, or food. Itaposs classic Torynomics - the maths of keeping rich people rich, as opposed to making the poor better off.But what more could he do, the backbenchers cry. Vladimir Putinaposs put up the price of oil and gas, the pandemic has caused supply chain problems, and working from home has pinched the economies of our cities. Weaposve lost £bn of trade since Brexit, there are traumatised Ukrainians and Afghan translators to accommodate, weaposre full, weaposre broke, weaposre buggered. Plus, it isnapost easy, being green! There are some quite cheap and easy ways that he COULD put some money in your pocket, though. And heaposs not going to bother with any of them.. Insulate every home in the UK The quickest way of saving money on energy bills is to insulate your home. The rate of doing this has stalled, and while not everyone wants or can afford full net-zero compliance of the sort which Insulate Britain crackpots demand, it is possible for lots of us to do better -we had help. Cutting % VAT on insulation of any sort, plus the same for adding solar , wind turbines, or heat pumps, would make a big dference. Heaposs not going to, because itaposs not sexy, and why should you lot get something for less. . Windfall tax on the energy firmsShell is on track to post a £.bn profit this year, while BP is likely to make £.bn. Oil firms are taxed high already - %, compared to most companiesapos % - but letaposs face it, theyaposre at no risk of the workhouse. And it would produce a massive, immediate, undodgeable payday for government which could use it to bring down bills. He wonapost, for fear that it sets a precedent, which was the opposite of his reasoning when he said heaposd have to raise taxes because of the pandemic.. Raise the NI thresholdNext month everyone with a job, and every firm, will be paying more for the privilege. The .% hike Rishi will talk about is more accurately described as % - because NI contributions will be going up by about a tenth, from % to .%. Itaposs expected to raise £bn a year for the next  years, and will be given to the NHS to repair pandemic damage.But heaposs also asking the NHS to save £.bn in waste. If you think the NHS is currently wasteful, itaposs not clear how throwing another £.bn at it will help. If you think the NHS is underfunded, giving it billions with one hand and taking billions with the other also wonapost help. So whataposs happening is youaposre getting taxed % more for something thataposs not helpful, in any scenario. In any event, it should not be paid by the poorest. Raising the threshold at which you start paying from £, to the same as the income tax floor of £, would be fairer - and he wonapost do it because it effectively creates a tax-free basic income for everyone in work. It would mean less poverty, less disease, better nutrition, better health, and in the years to come lower costs for the NHS and social care, but why should the bleeding obvious matter a jot   . Make Brexit betterThe UK waved goodbye to £bn of cross-border trade with Boris Johnsonaposs bad Brexit deal this year, at just the time the effects were worse thanks to the pandemic and, now, the war crime spree in Ukraine. Thereaposs a simple way to restore every penny of it, though, which is to end all tarfs and customs checks by complying with EU standards on goods and services.It turns out, they werenapost so bad after all. And there is not a human in the world who wants to fill in  pages of customs declarationsthere is an option to not do so. This wonapost happen either, because it would involve a government built on hoods and ignorance admitting publicly that it doesnapost know the first damned thing about what itaposs doing, which would make Rishi look like the best economist while stood in a field of financial morons. Read more . Resign The worst Chancellors in British history are the ones who presided over growing poverty because they did not know what it felt like. They never went hungry, never shivered, never missed out because they could not afford to exploit an opportunity. The better ones did experience that, and knew the price paid for being poor - they knew that it led to sickness, squalor, worse workers, lower tax takes, public health problems and generational, national failure. They could see how hungry children led to lower GDP, and wanted to fix it.Little Rishi argued that feeding children was too expensive. He said helping the self-employed was too dficult, unless they were able to provide some PPE and had a Toryaposs phone number, in which case he happily threw billions at them, no questions asked. He didnapost have a problem giving visas to rich Russians, and now the government heaposs part of is rationing the welcome mat for poor Ukrainians. He seems to resent helping to keep factories open and Brits in work, sohe pulls POaposs freeport contracts on the basis itaposs fired a third of its UK workforce and employed Filipinos on £ an hour, realism itself will seek the therapistaposs couch.There are global, and dficult, economic problems to resolve. It requires someone with empathy, experience, and imagination to tackle them. Instead this chancellor will do tiny things - bijou cashbacks, petite lies, small-minded solutions that solve nothing. Thataposs why heaposs Little Rishi - thinks little, knows little, does little. The Spring Statement will be nothing more than Torynomics - bedtime stories from a man whose only real goal in le is to replace the party-mad pillock in Number , rather than nurse a nation back to economic health.Youaposll never get any financial sense from a man who spends £ on a coffee cup and £ on slippers.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON PO CompanyConservative PartyBPEuropean UnionNHSBoris JohnsonVladimir PutinTaxEnergy billsOil pricesWar crimesCrimePoliticsSolar powerRishi SunakThe BudgetSpring Statement\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ami Maya, , from Crediton in Devon, spends up to £ every single month on having injections in her lips and has also had filler in her cheeks, jaw and chin in the past. Ami, who was  when she had her first injections, now pays to have them topped up whenever itaposs needed - and it works out as an expensive habit. But with her student maintenance loan working out to just under £, a year, sheaposs managed to soften the blow of the cost, using £, of it to pay for her lips. She has even sacriced nights out with her pals to save money for more injections. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Ami said: My friends would use their loan for shopping and going out, but I use mine for filler instead. My friends would always joke that I was spending taxpayersapos cash on lip filler. I have always been into changing my appearance. I think big lips are such a trend at the moment. Ami said she most recently had a filler appointment in January, and had paid for .ml to be injected. But when the nurse tried to administer the injection she told Ami there wasnapost enough space for .ml, because her lips were already so heavily filled.  In total, sheaposs had .ml of filler injected over the years - and despite some vicious trolling, sheaposs happy with her appearance.Ami said: “People would always make jokes and compare me to Katie Price, and calling me a fish face, they would tell me to stop getting filler and tell me I am ruining my face.“It used to bother me, and I used to retaliate but then I became unbothered and would let it just go over my head. In response to the trolls, Ami decided to tackle their nasty comments head-on and make videos responding to the cruel jibes. I just think they’re sad people with too much time on their hands, she said. I do struggle occasionally with trolls I do struggle with my mental health and I had an eating disorder so I am already critical of myself so when I see people giving me their negative opinions it solidies what I think of myself.

After the experts at her local branch in Midsomer Norton noticed a strange shadow in her scan in January, she was sent to Bristol Eye Hospital where she was told she had ocular melanoma - an eye cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells.The -year-old started radiotherapy last month at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and willin August for scans which will revealsheaposs in the all-clear.But the full-time-mum has since lost her vision in her left eye and claims that simple everyday tasks, like doing her make-up, have been made far trickier since having the treatment. Now two weeks post-procedure, Karly is hopeful that her vision will eventually improve and is keen to raise awareness of the importance of having routine eye tests given her tumour was spotted in the aposnick of timeapos. Specsavers optometrist Kaye Bradley said that itaposs aposvitalapos to see an optometristyou have any changes in your vision and that the Optical Coherence Tomography scan can help diagnose many eye conditions, as well as help make urgent hospitals when necessary.Karly, of Radstock, Somerset, said: Having that eye test pretty much saved my le. You have an eye test every couple of years andIaposd left it andit was ocular melanoma because theyaposve treated it as that because it was too small to biopsy and it was presenting as that, it would have spread to my liver. I just want people to be aware to get their eyes tested because itaposs really important. Make sure that when you go and get your eyes tested, that you have that extra test becauseI didnapost have it, then I wouldnapost have even known and it would have been a lot worse because I would have lost my eye. I definitely caught it just in the nick of time and they told me I was lucky because usually people my age donapost get it, itaposs usually  and over. Karly, who has been wearing glasses since the age of three, has routine eye tests and had the Optical Coherence Tomography scan during her appointment last month.  She said: They offered me the extra health eye check and I went with it. She brought up the pictures on the screen and at first we thought it was just a shadow. It wasnapost until we looked at it closely and she was like aposoh, itaposs not a shadowapos she wasnapost too sure what it was and she was really concerned so she said the best thing for me to do was to go to Bristol Eye Hospital. I went and had loads of dferent eye tests and they sent me up for a CT scan and said that they thought I had ocular melanoma. But at this point, I didnapost know what it was. Then he started talking about radiotherapy and when he said aposradiotherapyapos I thought aposoh, thataposs cancerapos. The mum was then referred to Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust where she stayed for three days to have her radioactive plaque treatment.  During the procedure a small metal disc was placed onto the surface of her eyeball over her tumour which gives out radioactive energy, with most of it directed inwards towards the tumour. Karly said: At first, it [receiving diagnosis] didnapost really click. The impact of it hasnapost really hit me until now I canapost see, now itaposs more upsetting for me because I canapost see anything. My vision is so blurry now, I canapost see out of my eye at all. If I look to the left itaposs just black. They did say that my eyesight would slowly come back and would slowly deteriorate. It all depends on how my body reacts to the radiotherapy. Every day is dferent for me. Every day I wake up and I see something dferent - it might be blurry, it might be fuzzy or I might have double vision. I never know what Iaposm going to wake up to. Iaposm hoping that Iaposll wake up one morning and my visionaposs a bit better, enough so I can see. Karly, whoaposs aposstill coming to termsapos with her impaired vision, said her eye is currently red and sore and that she wonapost know until a couple of months how much vision sheaposs lost. Karly said: I just want to go back and do normal things again. I havenapost been out shopping on my own. Iaposm too worried and get really anxious because I canapost see on my left sidesomeone walks by the side of me. Even just little things, like doing my make-up, are really hard because I canapost see. I canapost draw my eyebrows on because I canapost see and get a lot of double vision so canapost really see and do things how I did before. I have been hiding my face and put my hair right over it so you canapost see that side just because itaposs easier. Looking back now, Iaposve always suffered from really bad headaches and theyaposre one of the symptoms. I noticed at Christmas that I kept getting rings around lights and kept seeing floaty things. But it wasnapost enough for me to be concerned and think there was something wrong with my eye. I just thought they were down to my vision, I didnapost think for a second it would be what it was. A report issued by Specsavers last year revealed that there was a .million drop in the number of eye tests delivered in , a % decline compared to tests administered in . And that an estimated , people have lost vision due to delayed identication and treatment of eye disease, with some experiencing severe sight loss and blindness Kaye Bradley, optometrist at Specsavers Midsomer Norton, said: We really appreciate Karly coming forward and highlighting just how important regular eye examinations are. It’s vital that you see an optometristyou note any changes in your vision. aposThe Optical Coherence Tomography helps us to view the health of your eyes in greater detail, it allows us to see what’s going on beneath the surface of the eye. Many people don’t realise the capabilities of the equipment we have in store with the OCT, coupled with the experience of the team, we are able to help diagnose many eye conditions, as well as make urgent referrals to specialist hospitals when necessary.Do you have a story to share  Email yourmirror@reachplc.

Then one day, she suddenly collapsed on the floor with no warning. Fainting episodes and black-outs became frequent and she had to give up her role as leader of the cheer squad, because she couldnapost even tie her own shoelaces. The unexpected falls would lead to emergency hospital visits and le became miserable and lonely. That was until a golden four-legged friend came into her le, with a talent for snfing out seizures.Fay said: I have the perfect dog by my side and my le has never been better. I wouldnapost change a single thing.  to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Fay was diagnosed with postural tachycardia syndromeand gastroparesis, a long-term chronic stomach condition, as a teenager. I couldnapost go out on my own. It felt like I was losing everything, Fay described. I lost confidence in le. I felt like I was missing out on normal everyday situations. Fay had to spend six weeks in Southampton Hospital alone - but she never gave up hope entirely.In , she heard about Medical Detection Dogs and visited the centre for an initial meeting, where she came face-to-face with a Labrador retriever cross called Olive.Instantly, there was a strong connection. Medical alert dog Olive was able to detect when Fay was about to lose consciousness and warn her of the fall, so she could find a safe place on the floor.  I remember how comfortable she made me feel. I had no anxiety about being out in public. This wave of relief came over me, Fay explained. We got back in the car and I cried on the way home from the centre because I was so overwhelmed with excitement and hope for the future.The affects of Covid- put everything on hold, then in March , everything began to fall into place.Fay was partnered with Olive, by complete chance, and she changed her le overnight. She has this calming energy about her and just makes you feel relaxed in her presence, Fay explained. It feels asOlive has always been with us, like she was the missing piece to a puzzle and now it’s complete.Olive has a very high success alert rate which gives Fay up to five minutes before an episode. When she comes around, Olive gets water for Fay and can pick up dropped items.

On Thursday night, the protests began over Child Q – the black teenager scandalously strip-searched by police while menstruating at her school in Hackney, East London.The anger continued on Saturday and Sunday as thousands of adults and kids of all races and faiths voiced their contempt. More protests are planned in and outside the borough.Absolutely right too. Child Q’s private parts were exposed during the search. She was asked to bend over and cough by police who dragged her out of an exam because a teacher wrongly suspected her of carrying drugs. At her school hundreds of pupils went on strike last week, refusing to attend lessons and staging sit-ins. Teenagers at other schools in Hackney are preparing similar acts of defiance this week. They don’t feel safe. They don’t feel protected. How can they when – as the report into the scandal confirms – teachers leave the room and give officers carte blanche instead of acting in loco parentis  Who acts as the chaperone or the witness for Child Q’s defence  Who is there to tell the officers they are crossing the line And where, still, is the condemnation from Home Secretary Priti Patel or her boss, Boris Johnson I’d have gone ballisticChild Q had been my daughter. What breaks my heart as a dad is that so many of us parents have long since made our girlsaware of their rights so that no teacher or police officer could ever try to violate them in that way. Because the truth is that this kind of outrage tends to happen moreyou are black. The official report concludes as much on top of what we know already. But this weekend’s fightback is a line in the sand. A move towards real solutions – in Hackney and beyond. More black parents and s are signing up to become school governors. Kids are educating themselves on the legal boundaries for teachers and police. Because with a teacher we I am obviously supportive of the profession but some are entitled. Patronising towards parents and simply unwilling to listen to black children. Teenagers are using their voices to ensure they are not left as abandoned and traumatised as Child Q was in the room of that Hackney school. We’ve reached a watershed moment. Now the police have to be removed from our places of education. Especially the schools comprising pupils from poorer backgrounds and ethnic minorities. Once called upon, the report says, four officers arrived. You can see why Child Q would have been intimidated into complying with their demands. Much as the police and teachers might like to claim otherwise, the numbers suggest black children are racially discriminated against from an early age. A report from the Georgetown Law Centre on Poverty and Inequality, in Washington, D.C, US, found that adults saw black girls “as less inno­cent and more adult-like than white girls of the same age, espe­cial­ly between five- years old”. As such, they are presumed guilty when accused and treated more harshly by authority figures. And, surprise, surprise, black Caribbean students in our schools are excluded up to six times more than their white counterparts. Child Q has further exposed a crisis in our education system. Like you or I would, she is rightly suing the living daylights out of the school and police. But for our kids to be protected the culture has to be crushed.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Conservative PartyEducationSchoolsPoliticsRacismDaily MirrorPriti Patel\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The pair, from Southport, Merseyside, now have to raise £, in a week to save her le after she was diagnosed with patent ductus arteriosus .The defect can be deadlyleft untreated and consists of a hole in an artery that fails to close after birth. Vets requested that Bella go under the kne within a week for her to have any chance of survival, due to her condition being previously undiagnosed. Her operation is scheduled for March . Raf and Daria, originally from Poland, saw Bella advertised online and were reassured that the puppy had undergone standard health checks.  Two days after collecting the pup, they took her to the vets for a check-up and were told the heartbreaking news that she would need urgent surgery. Daria, , said: Three weeks ago, on February , we bought the dog off this private seller. We were told sheaposs had health checks and that she was brilliant so we believed them and bought her. After two days we took her to the vet who checked her. She said she needed a scan. So we booked the scan for the following week and the scan found that she had PDA which means she has a hole in an artery. She now needs an operation to close the hole. After this, we hope sheaposll be fine but we canapost get anyone to insure her because she has a pre-existing health condition. When we rang the seller and they denied selling her to us. After we said they did, the person just said it was their dad and that he would ring us. Since then we havenapost heard from them and they wonapost answer the phone. We were hoping they would pay for the operation becausewe gave her back they would probably kill her since she wouldnapost earn them any money. If the family do not manage to raise the money, they plan on taking out a loan to fund the operation. Daria also explained that since they got Bella, their five-year-old daughter, Kornelia, has fallen in love with her. She said: Weaposve only had her three weeks but we love her. We also have a five-year-old and she said to me: aposMum, please donapost give her to the angels. Iaposll give you all my money out of my piggy bankapos. She is melting my heart.

The dogs had been kept in dark sheds and had had very little human contact.Inspector Justin Stubbs, who led the rescue operation, said: “These were well loved dogs but the number had just become too much for the owner. We worked closely with them and they agreed it would be better for the dogs to come into our care where new homes could be found for them.”to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  The dogs had matted fur, fleas and were not used to being handled, and staff at RSPCA Block Fen Animal Centre, in Cambridgeshire, set about cleaning them up, treating them for ailments, and slowly getting them used to the outside world.Kennel supervisor Tfany Saunders said: “When Ralph arrived he was completely shutdown. He would squash himself at the back of his kennel and spent all of his time staring at the wall. He was very matted and covered in faeces and urine. “The team spent weeks just quietly sitting in his kennel with him offering him treats. Eventually, he’d come up behind us and take the treats from our hand before running away to the safety of his corner and eating them. He wouldn’t eat his dinner until night when we’d all gone home it was heartbreaking.” Staff continued and kept his routine strict so he’d only spend time with a few people who he slowly built strong bonds with.  “When he first wagged his tail as we entered the kennel it was so incredible!” Tfany added. Dedicated staff spent months gaining the dogs’ confidence and socialising them. Most of them needed their coats shaving off due to matts and many were suffering from flea infestations and ear infections. Tfany added: “The dogs had experienced little of the outside world and were all terried. They wouldn’t look at us and many would freezewe entered their kennel. Amazingly, like Ralph, one-by-one they each started to come out of their shell and really have flourished since.” The team slowly started to introduce Ralph to a harness and lead as he’d never even worn a collar before. Gradually they helped him learn how to meet new people and how to go out on walks, but the behaviour team knew they’d need to find very special owners who could continue his training in his new home. Sarah and Trevor Rix, from Norfolk, adopted Ralph in June , after he’d spent more than eight months working with the RSPCA’s dedicated behaviour and care teams.  Sarah said: “Ralph was a very timid, scared little boy when we rehomed him but with help of the RSPCA staff we became attuned to his needs and learned when to give him his space and when to encourage him to expand the boundaries of his comfort zone. With a calm and safe routine his behaviour gradually improved as his trust in us increased. “Ralph loves our other dog, Rosie, and she has helped him with some initial issues with toilet training and car travel. Ralph and Rosie love to go for woodland walks and we recently took the brave step of letting Ralph off the lead to run and play when we’re in safe areas he absolutely loves this. “Ralph has made lots of new friendsand has gradually overcome any uncertainty. Our regular acquaintances say they canapost believe how he has changed from a nervous seven-year-old puppy into such a happy, confident dog. “Ralph is a lovely little chap who melts the hearts of everyone he meets and is a favourite with all our family especially the grandchildren. He is a very sensitive and gentle character who may never fully escape his history but, every day, he brings love into our home. We feel the day we met him was the start of a wonderful relationship for all of us.” Tfany added: “It’s so wonderful to see how well Ralph is now doing in his new home, he’s unrecognisable from the frightened little dog who arrived with his friends almost  months ago during lockdown. This is what we do this job for, so dogs like Ralph can have the second chance that they deserve.”To help the RSPCA continue rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming animals in desperate need of care, like Ralph, please visit www.rspca.org.uk give to donate, or call our donation line on   .Do you have a dog story to share  Email paige.freshwater@reachplc.

In a video of the melee two groups can be seen clashing at around am on Sunday morning.At the start of the clip two men are being separated by five Merseyside Police officers, the Liverpool Echo reports. One light grey t-shirt wearing man is pulled towards the road while a man in a black t-shirt is jostled the other way along the street. As the men are in the grips of the officers, a blonde woman in a green dress is enters the fray. A second woman, with darker hair and a dark green dress, suddenly grabs her hair from behind.Three officers can be seen in the video jumping in to pull them apart. However, seconds after the blonde woman is freed from her attackeraposs grasp, she is grabbed by a male officer who flings throw her over his outstretched leg, causing her to land heavily on the pavement.The woman remains on the ground as the male officer and a female colleague stand over her.

But as the flight pushed over the half-way mark, an incident involving a disruptive passenger forced the pilot to ert to Vienna. Passengers had to wait on-board in the Austrian capital before setting off for Antalya for a second time at pm -with the plane finally touching down at pm, Manchester Evening News reports.One traveller on the flight - who asked not to be identied - explained how a female passenger became disruptive - causing a lot of noise. They told MEN: “Then she came to the front of the plane. She was really angry towards Jet staff and wouldn’t calm down. Her voice was getting louder and more aggressive - she was shouting in people’s faces.  “People were saying she was kicking off at the airport before she even got on the plane. Then some people said it was over babies crying on the flight. “A customer said something and she slapped him in the face. Then a man got up to try and calm the situation before taking her to the back of the plane.” The passenger said that staff then made the decision to ert the flight to Vienna. As the plane landed, the woman was said to have slapped another passenger as she was getting off.  “This is the first time we have had to land because of someone on a flight,” the passenger added. “Jet staff handled the whole situation very well. Nobody could help the out-of-control woman once she slapped the passenger.” Jet sent a text message to passengers onboard the flight just before pm, apologising for the incident. The message said: Hello, we are sorry that due to the disruptive behaviour of a fellow passenger, your flight has been erted to Vienna. We are working on a situation to get you on your way as soon as possible. The flight left Vienna at pm before arriving at Antalya just after pm - one hour and  minutes later than scheduled. Manchester Airport declined to comment on the situation, saying it was a matter for the airline to comment on. In a statement, Jet confirmed the incident. The flight operator also confirmed that the flight successfully continued onto Antalya once the passenger had been offloaded. A Jet spokesperson told the M.E.N: “We can confirm that flight LS from Manchester to Antalya erted to Vienna earlier today so that a disruptive passenger could be offloaded.

During their last engagement of the third day of their Caribbean tour, William and Kate attended a reception hosted by the Governor-General of Belize at the Maya ruins at Cahal Pech, near San Ignacio.For her first glam look of the tour, Kate wore a metallic pink full- dress from British label The Vampireaposs We, which she paired with a traditional Maya embroidered handbag. She also wore her hair in a sleek centre parting and wore a beautul pair of statement earrings.  During the reception, William gave a speech, where he said he was thinking of those struggling in Ukraine and added we stand with them in solidarity. He also referred to his children George, Charlotte and Louis and explained: Catherine and I have been deeply touched by the warm welcome Belizeans have given us.We hope toagain soon and to show our children this wonderful country. They are rather jealous that they are not with us now!” It was a marked departure from earlier in the day when William and Kate dressed down in their casual clothes as they visited ancient ruins.The couple wore khaki trousers as they travelled deep into the heartland of Belize to visit the Maya ruins of Caracol, which date back to  BC. Kate teamed her trousers by G-Star, which retail for £, with with a simple white T-shirt and Supergra white trainers and gold hoop earrings.

On the visit, she and William were given a tour of the site and had the chance to climb to the top and take in Caana, or sky palace, which remains the tallest man-made structure in Belize at ft.  The ,-year-old royal residence and temple, built by the Maya civilisation, stood at the centre of a city – home to an estimated , people. Allan Moore, associate director of Belize’s Institute of Archaeology, showed the couple around the site which featured other buildings and was discovered in the s by a logger looking for mahogany.He told them: “It’s like looking at the inside of Buckingham Palace. This is just a small fraction of what we have here.” After, the royal couple spent time with British and Belizean troops deep in the Chiquibul Forest, where they received a survival masterclass. William visited Belize as a teenager in , when he reportedly learned jungle survival techniques with the Welsh Guards who were receiving training from the British Army Training Support Unit as part of Exercise Native Trail. William was beginning a gap year before university at the time and while in the jungle, the then -year-old duke learned his A level results. Tomorrow the tour moves on to Jamaica, before going to The Bahamas on Thursday.Meanwhile, it has been reported that the Cambridgeaposs Caribbean tour could be marred by further protests in Jamaica, as campaigners accuse the Queen and her predecessors of perpetuating slavery.As the country marks its th anniversary, a coalition of Jamaican politicians, business leaders, doctors and musicians have called in an open letter for the British monarchy to pay slavery reparations.

Tracy Stephenson had stopped to buy two lattes at the drive-thru before dropping her partner off at work on February .A week later her partner received a £ fine in the post from UK Parking Controlwho claimed the van was outside for five hours and  minutes, Teesside Live reports. Tracy, , has appealed the fine, which can be halvedpaid quickly, but fears she does not have proof to convince them of her innocence. She said: For them to come out with this five hours and  minutes - itaposs absolutely ridiculous. I knew Iaposd come back to Darlington because I had appointments and was making phone calls. I doubt they havenapost even looked in the time frame of the  possibly  minutes after we were pictured going in to seewe had left. Have you been been given a ticket like Tracy  Email webnews@mirror  If I had done it I would have just owned up to it and paid the fine and sulked, but the fact I definitely was not there for that duration is just beggaraposs belief. I donapost know what  I can do, Iaposm just tearing my hair out. “Itaposs £ I havenapost got, Iaposm a single mum - my partner doesnapost live with me - and I canapost afford it and I refuse to pay it when I havenapost done anything wrong.” Having posted about her experience on social media someone replied she may have fallen foul of the “double dip” camera fault, where automatic number plate recognition cameras pick up the first entrance and second exit which are often hours apart. Although it is clear she is in the van on the first image, the number plate on the rear of the vehicle on the exit image, taken almost six hours later, is hazy and potentially a dferent vehicle. She fears her last hope to get proof she was parked on her drive in Darlington during the time through phone records. Tracy added: “They have dismissed the fact that Iaposve said I was not there. They havenapost investigated it any further on their side and theyaposre just wanting me to pay up. I would never use that drive-thru again and Iaposd be reluctant to use car parks operated by UKPC now.Iaposd never heard of the term double-dip before but Iaposd posted on Facebook and others whoaposve had similar things happen to them said itaposs when you go twice in the same day and the camera picks up your first entrance and last exit.I canapost remember ever going twice in one day. On the images, the first image is clearly my partner and I in the van and the number plate is as clear as day. The second one, the number plate is a bit hazy. You can make out the end of it but the start isnapost clear and could look like dferent letters and numbers. “Itaposs daylight robbery.” UKPC has been approached for comment.

I heard them screaming for help and I ran over. The parents were hysterical. Iaposve lived here for eight years but Iaposve never spoken to them before.Have you been impacted by this incident  Email webnews@mirrorPolice were called at around .pm following reports that a child had been attacked by a dog at an address in Blackbrook, St Helens. Emergency services attended and Bella-Rae was taken to hospital where she sadly died as a result of her injuries. The dog was handed over to the police at the address and has been humanely destroyed. Shocked residents of Bidston Avenue in the town spoke of their utter devastation after the horric incident.Locals in the “quiet” road fought back tears as they fondly remembered watching the tot playing with her brother. Neighbour Joanne Matthews, , said: She was such a beautul little girl, toddling about. Iaposd see the family in passing, just to say hello, and they were always very pleasant. One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: “They were a lovely family, and it’s just devastating what has happened. “The dog had a stocky build, it was a Staffordshire terrier or Pitbull, and it was fully grown. There was only one.  “It’s devastating. This is a normal quiet street, and the children would play in the street. The little girl, a toddler, was always about. It’s a shame I won’t be able to see that again. Mourners gathered to lay flowers at the house, which was taped off this morning as police officers stood guard. Neighbours said that the family of four had lived at the house for around three years but had only recently purchased the dog. Another neighbour, who only wanted to provide his first name, David, said: There were absolutely loads of police officers, there must have been about  police cars and ambulances.  The square was absolutely swarming with them, Iaposve never seen so many police in my le. I was just in shock when I heard a baby had been attacked by a dog. I believe the dog was tranquilised in the house with a dart gun. Other neighbours reported seeing the animal brought out with a metal collar and rod by police officers. Speaking this morning, Superintendant Steve Brizell said: We were called by the family of a  month old girl Bella-Rae Birch, Bella Rae has lost her le in the most unimaginably terrible circumstances and our thoughts are first and foremost with the family and the wider community at this time.  Our specialist family liaison officers are providing the family of Bella-Rae with support and officers will remain in the area in the coming days to provide further support and reassurance for the wider community. Detective Inspector Lisa Milligan said yesterday: This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the child’s family at this devastating time. The little girl’s parents and wider family are absolutely devastated and our specialist Family Liaison Officers are providing them with support at this horrendous time. Whilst we are in the very early stages of the investigation into this extremely tragic incident we can confirm that the dog was only bought by the family a week ago and officers are working to identy the previous owners of the dog concerned and establish its history. Our officers will remain on Bidston Avenue this evening and in the coming days to provide reassurance to the local community and we will work tirelessly to establish the full circumstances. “If you were in the Bidston Avenue area this afternoon and witnessed anything, or have any information about the dog in question then please come forward speak to one of our officers. Our officers take the issue of dangerous dogs very seriously.

Dr Well adds: I have started to see patients who aren’t eating, or aren’t eating well.Living on toast, living on fizzy, sugary drinks, and go all day on that.  Patients are contacting us desperate for help to buy food, even be prescribed nutritional shakes as [theyaposre] feeling so weak having paid their energy bills, [paid for] petrol to get to work, increasing costs [mean they are] unable to eat. We would never prescribe nutritional supplements, itaposs not the answer to the problem and itaposs not the right thing to do.But people have asked me and thataposs a really upsetting thing to hear.Someone has to be in a really dficult place to get to that point. The medicaposs concerns come as energy bills are set to go up by £ per year for around  million people from the start of April.People are also bracing themselves for rising inflation and tax hikes, which will a further rise in October as well. Making matters worse, the cost of petrol is also skyrocketing as the Russia-Ukraine war rages on, with sanctions also impacting the UKaposs finances, the Chancellor warned ahead of his Spring Statement on Wednesday.Controversy surrounding Rishi Sunakaposs announcement last month that million households will get a £ aposrebateapos on their energy bills from October, as he shared that this money will be clawed back by hiking bills by £ per year over five years from . As many as one in four patients are raising anxieties around the cost of living to the Bolton GP, she estimates, out of approximately  per day.All of her practice colleagues are seeing similar patterns.  She added: Itaposs become a routine question now when I see people with health issues that might be impacted by poor nutrition or not eating.Previously it was aposare you managing to eat aposAs in aposhave you lost your appetite apos Now itaposs aposare you physically managing to get food to eat apos The weight of financial worries can have a devastating impact - only adding to the fatigue of a population already aposbattered mentally and financiallyapos as it continues to deal with a now two-year-long pandemic, according to the GP. She said: What has struck me is that some of the patients Iaposve spoken to in the past week or two, itaposs the embarrassment and humiliation that people feel.Theyaposre telling the GP because some of them havenapost told their friends that they canapost afford to eat because they donapost want that humiliation.  Your friend or your health care specialist might not be able to fix that for you instantly, but it will really help your mental healthyou feel like you can share it. While fellow GP, Dr Murugesan Raja, has not yet had such drastic requests from his patients, he is worried by the rise in the numbers heaposs aware of using food banks.Food poverty was a big issue already, said the Fallowfield -based doctor. Likewise, Dr Faisal Bhutta, a GP in Hyde, says he too is aware that the practiceaposs local food bank has been aposvery busyapos lately.The Bolton GP says she is looking for more ways they can help with food poverty, in anticipation that the problem will only grow, and voluntary groups or charities may be overwhelmed by whataposs coming.  Dr Wall hopes for the destigmatisation of financial struggles, so people feel comfortable to put their hands up and say I need help, I canapost survive like this and direct Government intervention, like a cap on expanding living costs. In response to the MENaposs questions about those on the breadline going to their GP for urgent help, a government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £billion this financial year and next to help. This includes putting an average of £, more per year into the pockets of working families via changes to Universal Credit, freezing fuel duties to keep costs down and helping households with their energy bills through our £.billion Energy Bills Rebate. “We’re also boosting the minimum wage by more than £, a year for full-time workers and our £million Household Support Fund is helping the most vulnerable with essential costs.” But in the short term, less nutritional food is often cheaper, Dr Wall points out.Andpeople arenapost getting their basic vitamins and minerals, it can lead to a host of further medical problems, such as delayed healing time, immune system decline and a higher risk of infection. Years down the line, that could spell upticks in diabetes, heart disease - and thataposs before mentioning mental health. People are saying things like aposI havenapost gotten right to be worried about this because it could be worse, we could be in a war situationapos, sighs Dr Wall.Thereaposs that guilt that things arenapost as bad as others have them. All of that is going impact on peopleaposs mental health.And itaposs a real concern that weaposre only at the edge of this, coming into it. We all know it’s probably going to get worse, not better unless something changes dramatically.

Zara Barton, , said her skin started to become itchy last February but dismissed it as a stress rash from an aposupsetting break-upapos or from boozing too much and was prescribed creams and antihistamines by doctors. She put her persistent cough weight loss and a hard cm lump that appeared above her collarbone down to leading a apostypical student lestyleapos. However, after the hives on her body became aposunbearableapos the fashion marketing and branding student pressed for answers and was shocked to eventually be diagnosed with stage three Hodgkin Lymphoma last November. The student had her eggs collected to help preserve her fertility before she started chemotherapy in December, and now, halfway through her treatment, she received the good news last month that there were no signs of active cancer in her body. The -year old is passionate about raising awareness of the symptoms of Hodgkin Lymphoma and urges anyone who recognises the symptoms to visit a doctor - and to keep ingtheyaposre not taken seriously. Zara, of Solihull, West Midlands, said: I thinkpeople recognise the symptoms, donapost hesitate to go to the doctors, evenyou feel like it is nothing because I just assumed aposit was nothing to worry about.  Something like itching, I didnapost have a clue that that was a sign of blood cancer. Itaposs best to double-check and you can tell when somethingaposs not right, even at the very start when I was getting the itching I just thought aposthis isnapost me, this doesnapost feel right. So itaposs important to be persistentyou still feel like something is wrong. Iaposve had so many comments on my TikTok about people with similar experiences of going to the doctors and not really being listened to and I guess thataposs because weaposre young and they just think apostheyaposre fit and healthyapos. The -year old said that her itching started last February and she visited the doctor in May where she was prescribed medication, which she hoped would solve the issue. However, it got progressively worse to the point where sheaposd scratch her skin so much it would bruise. In addition, she experienced weight loss and lost around a stone - but thought it was due to eating less. Zara said: Iaposd itch, which would then come up in hives almost anywhere on my body - so my arms, legs, feet, anywhere really.  It would literally drive me mad. It would be hot and was really getting unbearable. It was really persistent and there was nothing I could do to stop it. I had creams that I would put on but I remember sometimes Iaposd lie there with cold flannels and a fan just to try and make it more bearable. I put the itching down to multiple things. I did go through a pretty upsetting breakup in Mayand during that time had a bad stress rash, so I thought maybe that had continued. I thought being at university with constant late nights, drinking regularly, probably not eating as well as I should - these were just lestyle things that made me think at the time aposokI was eating more healthily, getting more sleep, not going out as much then maybe this wouldnapost be happeningapos. The -year old had a aposreally reactive swollen glandapos on one side of her neck which would disappear and reappear again for months. But she thought this wasnapost a cause for concern, given sheaposd previously had swollen glands from having tonsillitis and was at university where she assumed sheaposd pick up colds and illnesses. Zara said: When I first noticed it [the lump], I wasnapost alarmed at all. It was during freshers so I thought maybe it was a bit of freshers flu and could just be a swollen gland. I also noticed I had a cough which never really went away. I thought it was freshers flu. My friends all had coughs at around the same time, it was nothing really dferent compared to the people around me.I put a lot of my symptoms down to student le, especially with not being at home. My mum and I were sayingI was at home maybe we would have picked it up sooner but because youaposre so on the go you kind of just brush these things off. It was a bit dficult to get seen by the doctors as well as they were mainly telephone consultations. Theyaposre symptoms that you can so easily put down to something  and I guess I thought they were all separate issues. Zara said that at the start of October she found another lump above her collar bone and ed to the doctors, who she claims wasnapost concerned. However, at the end of the month, she saw another doctor who ran several blood tests and referred her for an urgent ultrasound scan. On November th, the evening of her scan, Zara received her diagnosis. Zara said: The doctor obviously didnapost want to have to tell me this over the phone but Iaposd been so persistent on finding out I couldnapost wait until the next day. He was like aposhave you heard of Lymphoma apos and I was like aposno, what is it apos He was like aposoh, itaposs blood cancerapos. Obviously that was just a huge shock. I just didnapost know what to expect, what that meant and what I was about to go through.He was trying to explain the treatments I might have. Obviously we didnapost know everything about it yet and we still had to find out what type and stage. You think the worst I suppose. My scan results came back showing it was stage three. It came back and showed that it was all in my neck, chest and in my spleen. That was quite scary as well finding out that it had got to that point without me knowing because I felt so normal in myself otherwise. After she was told that there was a risk of becoming infertile after chemotherapy, the student had an operation to remove and freeze her eggs in December. Ten days later Zara started chemotherapy at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and has since had seven rounds with five more to go. She said that her itching stopped after her first session and has decided to take a year out of her studies, and will redo the year come September. Since her diagnosis, the teen who shares informative videos about the uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, said that the support sheaposd received from family, friends and even strangers has been amazing. Zara said: My diagnosis has affected my le a lot. I was living at university with my friends and literally felt the happiest Iaposd ever been, so I felt like Iaposd gone from my highest point to my lowest really. I posted my story online because when I was diagnosed I was going to tell my close friends and I thought people were going to hear about it anyway and when people hear that someoneaposs got cancer, you donapost want them to think the worst. I wanted people to know that this is a treatable type of cancer and I just thought that it wasnapost something that I wanted to hide, or be embarrassed about, itaposs just something thataposs happened. So I just wanted to share my journey and be open about it. I didnapost realise that Lymphoma is the most common cancer in teenagers and young adults and considering Iaposve never heard about the symptoms, I wanted to raise a bit of awareness in the process. I just wanted to show that you are still you as well when you are going through your treatment, youaposre not defined by a diagnosis. I didnapost want anyone to feel sorry for me, I wanted people to see that Iaposm still me. My diagnosis has put things in perspective - leaposs too short, just do what makes you happy I suppose.

Joan Blass died in March , sparking the beginning of a nightmare for her family. Her son and daughter became worried when a man  years younger became friends with her and moved in with her five months before her death. Daughter Daphne Franks, of Skipton, North Yorkshire was concerned because her mum was not aware he lived in her home and did not no know his name or where he was from.She told LeedsLive : Mum never seemed to know he lived there.She was asking, aposwhat is his name  Where did he come from apos At this stage, Joan could barely recall her own name, let alone that of her new toyboy.  When she died, the family discovered that Mr Folan had married her and the dementia sufferer was still wearing the wedding ring from her late husband Ron. Ron died in  after  years of the couple being together. Her new marriage meant her two children Daphne,  ,and Michael, , lost out on their £, inheritance because the registry office ceremony annulled her will. Daphne discovered three days after her motheraposs death that she had been married in a civil ceremony at Leeds Town Hall. Speaking to Predatory Marriage UK, Daphne said: We had contacted my motheraposs GP on so many occasions, the police, the social services, and had also taken legal advice and had been told that she could not make another will or marry again because of her severe dementia. Taking the toyboy to court The marriage meant the will Mrs Blass had drawn up, naming her two children as beneficiaries, was void and she died intestate, meaning her new husband automatically inherited her assets. Daphne decided to take legal action after Folan, now , took over the funeral arrangements. The hearing lasted four days but sadly for the family, siding with Mr Folan. Mrs Franks and her relatives were left with a £, legal bill. On top of that, none of Joanaposs relatives were invited to her funeral and she was buried in an unmarked grave.  Pushing for change Since the nightmare the family have been pushing for action to stop predatory marriages. Predatory Marriage UK aims to reform marriage laws and procedures to protect people with dementia. In  Fabian Hamilton, MP for Leeds North East, called on the PM to stop elderly and vulnerable people being preyed upon by tricksters leading to families losing their inheritance. Mr Hamilton first began campaigning on the matter a few years ago after hearing a story he could “hardly believe was possible in modern Britain”. He said: “It’s not good enough for a registrar simply to say that because one of the participants in the marriage ceremony was smiling at the time, that meant consent was happily given. The family have been working with Hourglass charity to welcome round-the-clock help. Mrs Franks said a   helpline would make an absolute dference. The Frank family have recently been working with Hourglass charity to get round-the-clock help for those affected by elder abuse. Ms Franks said a   helpline would make an absolute dference. She added thatshe had known about a helpline before she would have definitely rung it. The Hourglass charity said it was moving Its helpline to a   operation because more than a quarter of the calls it received went unanswered during out of hours. It said Home Office funding meant it was now able to extend its service to make sure calls were being answered day and night. Richard Robinson, Hourglass CEO, said: Thankfully we are increasingly aware of other forms of abuse like child abuse and domestic violence, but the abuse of older people remains in the shadows even though it affects millions. So many people are suffering and donapost know where to turn for help.

People are being warned to wear sunscreenoutside for long periodsThe mercury could rise to C on Tuesday Image: Adam Gerrard   Daily MirrorByTim HanlonNews Reporter:,  Mar |commentsBrits can look forward to soaring temperatures over the next week with seven days at least of warm sunshine with the mercury set to hit C.Spring has arrived in the UK with above average temperatures on the back of a cold start to March, says the Met Office, although there will still be frosty starts to the day.People are set to head out this week and enjoy the sunshine with blue skies up and down the country. A high pressure system to the east of the country is moving in and by Wednesday it will be centred over the UK. Southern areas including parts of London and Cambridge are set to bask in up to C heat on Tuesday, and forecasters have advised anyone spending long periods outdoors to wear sunscreen.  Following a warm weekend when the mercury hit .C in Kinlochewe in Scotland, Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said Brits can look forward to a further “seven days” of sunshine “at least”. “There will be more spring sunshine to come during the rest of the week,” he said. “High pressure close to the east then becomes increasingly centred over the UK from Wednesday into Thursday and Friday. “That high pressure isn’t going anywhere for the foreseeable. For the next seven days at least it’s going to bring plenty of warm sunshine.”  He added that “iable amounts of cloud” will move across parts of northern England, the Midlands and southern Scotland on Tuesday bringing “a few lights showers”, but most of the day will be dry and sunny. Mornings will also feel cold and could drop to -C in Scotland but for the rest of the country it should be above freezing. A fresh start or a chilly start in places on Tuesday morning, you’ll see that cloud across central areas moving south and a few spots of rain associated with it but it tends to fizzle away by the afternoon perhaps reforming to give a few showers across northern England and southern Scotland later in the day, said Mr McGivern.  Otherwise away from that area, plenty of sunshine and in western parts, a sunnier day compared to Monday. Temperatures reaching C to C quite widely from central Scotland down to the south of England. Could see C to C in London or Cambridge, for example. The far north, Shetland, staying cold with a brisk breeze coming off the North Sea but for most the temperatures are well above average for the time of year. Similar temperatures are forecast for the following days, with the mercury dropping one or two degrees towards the end of the week. UK forecast for the next  days Tuesday sunny and warm for many, only very isolated showers. Today: Mostly dry with spells of hazy sunshine. Scattered showers may develop over the Midlands, northern England, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland during the afternoon. Most places missing these but the odd one could be heavy. Warm in the sunshine. Tonight: Any showers fading, then dry with clear spells. Some rural spots ending up with grass frost, while a few fog patches are likely, more especially in east and northeast England. Wednesday: After any fog clears, many areas fine, with temperatures well above average and feeling warm in the sunshine. One or two places in the east could catch a stray shower. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Dry for most with warm sunny spells and patchy rural frost and fog overnight. Cloudier across the far north with some patchy rain or drizzle at times. Light winds.

Itaposs estimated that almost half of the UKsuffer from hay fever, according to AllergyUK, but with overlapping symptoms it becomes hard to dferentiate between a common cold or even Covid-. Here, with the help of health experts, we explain the dference in symptoms, and what you should look out for. How to tellyouaposve got a cold or Covid  With so many overlapping symptoms, it can be hard to dferentiate between a cold and Covid.Firstly, be aware of the main symptoms of Covid. According to the NHS, they are: A high temperature A new, continuous cough A loss or change to your sense of smell or tasteThe common cold can have similar symptoms. According to the NHS, they are:A blocked or runny noseA sore throat Headaches Muscle aches Coughs Sneezing A raised temperature Pressure in your ears and face Loss of taste and smellDeep Patel, LloydsPharmacy’s Vaccination Services Manager, further explained the dference between a cold and Covid. He said: People can confuse a common cold and Covid- as they’re both respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by dferent viruses. Colds generally do not cause serious health problems such as pneumonia or bacterial infections, and they rarely lead to hospital care. Typical cold symptoms are sneezing a lot and a runny nose, sometimes you’ll also have a high temperature of .C or more. Unlike a cold the symptoms we see with Covid- tend to be much more severe and often include a dry and continuous cough, loss of taste and shortness of breath.

The mystery driver was seen crossing a junction in front of other cars as he towed the portable home in his wake. The bizarre scene was filmed by Casey Hulme in north Wales, who joked on Facebook : “I can’t believe what I’ve just witnessed.“Only in Rhyl.” Her video has since been viewed .million times and had , shares by incredulous people.Casey, , told Mail Online : “I was on my way home with my friend and I saw the boy on the mobility scooter trying to pull out of a junction.“aposI turned the car around and we parked on a street off the main road the guy was going down with the caravan and watched them go past.aposI think my reaction on the video speaks for itself. We were crying with laughter.apos Thousands of people have commented on her original post. One said: “This will be me with the BMWthese prices keep on going up.” Another joked: “This is what happens when you expect to go away for a weekend and you donapost want to take the car because of the fuel prices.” Another said: “I really need to know how this ended. “I mean heaposs going to stop - but that caravan isn’t.”  The Government’s website says drivers do not need a licence for a mobility scooter but only certain types can be driven on roads.

Last year in Manchester a rider held up “more than  cars” by refusing to pull over in a one-way street as he waited for his chippy tea to be brought out, prompting honks from “irate” motorists.Bizarre footage of the incident shows the hungry customer parked up in the centre of the road in Manchester city centre last Friday, blocking a large truck and the cars behind from passing. Multiple people were seen attempting to help or intervene, only for the stubborn man to repeatedly shout “I just want the fish and chips that Iaposve paid for”.

Pals are said to be hopeful that Kabaeva can persuade him to bring the bloodshed to an end.A source told Page Six : “Alina’s female friends are begging her to fly to Putin and persuade him to end the war.“He doesn’t seem to be listening to anybody, but perhaps he might listen to her.” But the insider claimed Kabaeva is fearful about how Putin will reactshe voices any opposition to the conflict. They said that the president is surrounded by rings and rings of security, adding: Alina says she doesn’t knowshe can get to him – and evenshe does – she doesn’t knowshe’ll be able to get out again to be with their kids.” The West has so far not sanctioned Kabaeva - although as well as being Putin’s rumoured secret partner, she is also chairman of the board of directors at National Media Group, a major Kremlin-obedient TV and newspaper behemoth, at a salary of almost £ million a year. A petition signed by nearly , people likens her with Eva Braun, Hitleraposs mistress.It says: “It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer. And it continues: “Despite the current war, Switzerland continues to host an accomplice of Putin’s regime. “The public has just learned that the Russian political and media figure, and former [rhythmic gymnast], Alina Kabaeva, is hiding the consequences of the sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation in your country.“She is the favourite we of [the] delusional dictator and war criminal who has been treacherously attacking Ukraine over the past weeks. “As she is supportive of social activities in Russia, she has been attempting to get Russian citizens accustomed to the reality of sanctions after , and personally proclaimed: ‘The worse it gets, the better for us!’”The signatories question why “given the volume of sanctions placed on Russia” the authorities continue to host her and her family at a time when Putin “is destroying the lives of millions”. The petition continues: For the first time in modern history, your country has violated its neutrality, which it did not even do vis-à-vis Nazi Germany in the th century, and joined the sanctions against Putin and his surroundings. “And now you are allowing his favourite mistress and her children to hide within the borders of your state.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Eva BraunVladimir PutinRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The discovery inside an abandoned house was documented on TikTok by a professional from the Victorian-based DAP Pest Control, who said he’d “never seen anything like it”. The experienced exterminator said “fricking hell” repeatedly as he walked towards the giant nest, which was located in the bathroom. According to Yahoo News reports, he described the operation as “unbelievable” and “terrying” in a follow-up TikTok. He told his followers of how he’d “never seen” anything like it before, comparing it to “something out of an alien movie”. The man donned a full suit and mask to protect himself from being stung by the insects, as he went to tackle the situation at the home in Healesville, northeast of Melbourne.He showed close-up videos of the incredible removal and began hitting the nest with a stick, causing thousands of wasps to emerge from the nest, swarming the room, according toYahoo News reports .The man shuts the door before spraying the insects, then opens the door again and continues the process. He occasionally picks up pieces of the nest, which he said felt like “cardboard”.  Can you hear the buzzing  he said at one point. This is unbelievable,” he continued. According to TikTok footage, wasps nests are usually situated on the ground. This typically makes it harder to see them - which makes the nest shown in the video particularly unique.

The poster’s followers were both mesmerised and horried by the clip. Thataposs a job for a flamethrower my friend, one user commented, with another agreeing: this is the only answer.

In , he said: “I have a private le in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected. “I have always reacted negatively to those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others’ lives.” There is also speculation that the former head of the KGB fathered another daughter after an extra-marital affair and even reports that he shares four children with a former Olympic gymnast once dubbed ‘the most flexible woman in Russia ’. Many must now be wondering what they must be thinking watching Putin destroy homes and leave children orphaned in Ukraine - especially as many have strong links with the Western countries he hates.Others have decided that their silence about the war is just as bad. Over the weekend activists broke into a £million villa in Biarritz, southern France, belonging to purported daughter Katerina Tikhonova, declaring it to be a shelter for Ukrainian refugees.  And last week a group occupied land in Amsterdam belonging to her sister Maria Faaseen - scattering candles, and leaving a note. “Less than ,km from your peaceful piece of free land, your father is decimating an entire free country and its people,” it read. “Please use your heart to reach his and stop this senseless suffering.”University College London’s Ben Noble, co-author of a new biography on opposition figure Alexey Navalny - Navalny: Putin’s Nemesis, Russia’s Future  - says Putin’s blackout on any mention of his family “couldn’t be a bigger contrast with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ”.He says: ”Before the invasion, Zelensky was so often seen smiling surrounded by his family. The image of Putin now is one of him isolated, serious, and working on his own in the Kremlin. The optics are so remarkably dferent.”Maria, , and Katerina, , are his two alleged daughters by ex-we Lyudmila Putina, who he orced in  after  years of marriage - although he has never publicly named them as his heirs. Maria was born in her father’s home city Leningrad - now St Petersburg - in , and Katerina in Germany, where the family lived during Putin’s time in the KGB. The girls then attended a German-language school after the family moved to Moscow in , but were taught at home after their father became acting president four years later. Both then studied at St Petersburg State University, under  identities. Maria, now , become a paediatric endocrinologist and a top expert on dwarfism. She’s married to Dutch businessman Jorrit Faassen, with whom she shares a child - making Putin a grandfather. When filmmaker Oliver Stone reportedly asked Putinhe played with his grandchild, the president was said to have replied: “Very seldom, unfortunately.” Katerina, , on the other hand, is best known for her success as an acrobatic rock ’n roll dancer and a member of Russia’s Council for the Development of Physical Culture and Mass Sports.  She was previously married to Kirill Shamalov, the son of the co-owner of one of Russia’s largest banks. But while some might reasonably hope Putin’s Westernised daughters might be horried enough to try his aggression, others aren’t so optimistic. Lyudmila Putina revealed how the president “spoils” Maria and Katerina. “Not all fathers are as loving with their children as he is. He has always spoiled them, while I was the one who had to disciple them,” she wrote on a Government website. Now grown up, both enjoy lavish lestyles.  When Katerina orced in , it was revealed she and her ex had shared assets of £.billion, thanks to a stake in Russian petrochemicals company SIBUR Holding, acquired from oligarch Gennady Timchenko, a longtime friend of Putin. Their seaside villa in France is estimated at £.million. Katerina was also in charge of a billion-pound state project to establish a science hub at Moscow State University. Meanwhile, Maria was alleged to have a home in Surrey. It was speculated the sisters were about to take on a more prominent public role after their surprise appearance at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum last year. Katerina gave a six-minute speech and Maria gave a -minute interview on rare diseases that was broadcast on state TV. Commentator, Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Centre, remarked: “Why bring these purported daughters of Putin to such an event and what was the point of them speaking publicly  “Maybe this is just a little drawing back of the curtain. Maybe this is a foretaste of some sort of emergence onto the big stage.” Mystery surrounds Putin’s other alleged offspring.  Luiza Rozova, , has never formally been acknowledged by the Russian President but was reported to be his lovechild with Svetlana Krivonogikh, , a former cleaner who is now a part-owner of a major Russian bank and one of the country’s wealthiest women. The independent media outlet which first aired rumours of the affair was later barred from ing by the authorities. While Luiza has never made any public comments about her father, she recently admitted to Russian GQ that she “probably looks similar” to a young Putin. The -year-old’s Instagram account, which had had , followers, was deleted last week. In , the Russian newspaper Moskovsky Korrespondent ran a story reporting that Putin had fallen for Russian Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, . The rumours persisted when, in , she was pictured pregnant and spoke of a mystery man she “loves very much”. She was alleged to have given birth to seven-year-old twin daughters in Switzerland in February that year, and some claimed they also share two boys, although their ages or existence have never been formally confirmed. The family have a luxury mansion in the Swiss lakeside idyll of Lugano - where, as Putin’s bombs rain down on family homes in Ukraine, they are believed to be hiding out. Any hope that the children will be able to dissuade their father from his ongoing attack on Ukraine is slim. None are ever seen making political comments or revealing their political allegiance -evenphotos show them looking distinctly westernised.  It’s even been claimed in Moscow that Putin is gradually grooming Katerina as his eventual successor in . “Trying to run a woman through an election campaign in Russia is quite an interesting and modern political experiment,” wrote Natalia Gevorkyan, a Putin biographer. “Putin does not have aheir - at least officially. But Katerina has already entered the public space with several huge and costly projects, she wrote for Radio Svoboda website. “In , Katerina will be . In theory, she can take part in the presidential elections and provide a calm time in old age for her father and his closest friends.”  Luiza has kept equally obtuse about her personal politics.Her now-deleted Instagram posts were all about her extravagant snap-happy lestyle: her breakfast of sliced exotic fruit on heart-shaped plates, bikini selfies, her smart Paris apartment, new shoes and trips to the Louvre.Her job as an ambassador for a high-end personal shopping site, similarly suggests she shares Putin’s love of high fashion but gives no indication of whether she shares his views. And with her not even publicly acknowledged by Putin, whatever she might be feeling about his actions in Ukraine is likely to bear little import on the world stage.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty round up saturday march 5 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowThe new shinty season got up and running with goals galore across the country on Saturday March .Fort William  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from two goals down to earn a - draw with Fort William in their pm throw-up at An Aird.Kyles travelled with just  players following Robbie Macleod’s late call-off as former Lochcarron player Liam Arnott made his competitive debut for the Cowal outfit.Both keepers # Paul MacKay for Fort William and Kyles Athletic’s John Whyte # made good saves before the hosts took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Cam Stephen.Victor Smith made it - a couple of minutes after the re-start.Kyles got a goal a couple of minutes later through Arnott, his bouncing shot deceiving Paul MacKay.The goal lted Kyles and Conor Kennedy made it - with  minutes remaining, punishing the Fort defenders for not clearing their lines.Kyles laid siege on the Fort goal as they went all out to get the winning goal but to no avail.The sides were also playing for Drew Ferguson Memorial Trophy, won by Fort William after a penalty shoot-out.Inveraray  Glenurquhart Inveraray, relegated from the Premiership at the end of the  season, drew - with promotion hopefuls Glenurquhart at the Winterton.Both goals came in the first half, with Glenurquhart’s Conor Golabek netting on  minutes and Campbell Watt drawing Inveraray level on  minutes.Col Glen P Bute PThe meeting between Col Glen and Bute was called off on Saturday morning when the pitch at Glendaruel failed an inspection.Kilmory  Inveraray After winning the league in , Kilmory welcomed the Inveraray second team to MacRae Park.Joe Anderson got the Lochgilphead side off to a great start with a goal after  minutes, but Euan McMurdo’s th minute strike saw the score level at the break.Ewan Donnan scored what proved to be the winner on the hour for Inveraray.Strachur-Dunoon P Uddingston PThe match at Strachurmore between Strachur-Dunoon and Uddingston was postponed due to lack of pitch preparation time after recent wet weather."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

I’ve looked forward to this date since we entered and it’s what I’ve been working towards. My aim is to defend my gold,possible, but I want to see how well I can do and give him [his dad] a good run for his money.“I’ve made a few changes to my training, my bike and my run style slightly so we’ll see how that all pays off, but I love racing at Oulton Park, it’s a really nice track, a lovely atmosphere, it should be a really good day of racing.”Preparing to defend his M- British title, Leahn added: “This time around it’s at the beginning of the year so it’s going to be interesting, especially as the fields are much deeper this year which is great because that’s what it should be for a British Championships. But I’m going there to try and defend my title, I’ve got a taste for it now after last year and then it’s building up to the Worlds and Europeans later in the year.”Reflecting on the moment they shared on the podium together, Leahn said: “It was such a proud moment to see Dylan on the podium and to be able to share it with him made it even more special.“You are focused on your own race and your own effort, and it can be hard to work out who is in which age group when you’re racing, so until you cross the line you never really know where you’ve placed.“So, to find out I had won and then to see Dylan crossing the line to win his age group was a really nice feeling, especially having seen all the training and hard work he put in last year. It was a nice surprise to be driving home with two gold medals in the car.”.removeLast year’s championships was Dylan’s first standard distance duathlon and his first experience of a British Championships.“I had raced at Oulton Park earlier in the summer, so I knew the track and I really enjoyed racing there,” Dylan said. “I felt a lot more confident in October than at the race in June, but it was a whole new experience for me because it was across a distance I had never raced before.“It was a lot of unknowns, a lot of guess work, but it was an amazing feeling to cross the line and to be told you’re British champion. To be able to stand on the podium with my dad was amazing.”Last year saw Leahn claim world bronze at the World Triathlon Duathlon Championships in Spain. Later this year he will be back in Spain for the European Standard Distance Duathlon Championships in September, when he will be joined on the GB Age-Group Team by Dylan for the first time.“I’ve had the opportunity to travel and compete in dferent places and meet so many dferent people at races who I genuinely call friends, and now seeing the development and progression of Dylan within the sport is fantastic,” Leahn said.“When Dylan was youngerI was doing a long run, he would cycle alongside me and then at the weekend we would both run. Now we’ll do sessions together, we train together after Dylan comes home from school or at the weekend, and we also compete against each other at cross country. I’m so proud of him to see how he’s come from someone who used to follow me around on the bike to now I’m following him, and that’s purely down to his own effort and determination.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"information is key in kintyre","story":"Campbeltown-based Keeping it local CICis introducing the screens up and down the peninsula, including Tarbert and on the Isle of Gigha.A spokesperson for the community interest company said: #With the support of fantastic businesses all over we are able to provide up-to-date information on events, news, travel and destination areas to visit all around the area at the touch of a button.#The work we do is also supported by advertising on our screens while promoting your own business offerings.#The boards should be up and running by April, all being well.The aim of Keeping it local CIC is to support businesses, trades, services and events by collating information and bringing all that Kintyre has to offer under one roof # a one-stop-shop for the consumer and businesses.The Tarbert information boards are due to be located at One Fyne Deli and at The Gather restaurant."},{"url":null,"title":"island residents and friends have a happy 20th gigha day","story":"Celebrations were in full swing this week as residents on the Isle of Gigha marked  years of community ownership.After extensive community fundraising alongside securing grants and loans from Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the National Lottery, Gigha was purchased by the community for the sum of £m on March  .On this day the island was handed over to the Isle of Gigha Heritage Trusta day that is marked on the island every year as #Gigha Day#.To commemorate this -year milestone all Gigha residents and key island stakeholders were invited to watch Gigha’s eldest female resident Ina McNeill raise the island flag on Tuesday.This was followed by a display from the pupils of Gigha Primary School and a performance by the Kintyre Schools Pipe Band, who made the journey over from Campbeltown to attend.The Isle of Gigha Hotel then welcomed the guests for refreshments and to view a display of island memorabilia and photographs from the past  years.Since the buyout the permanent population of the island has grown from around  up to  residents.This has been achieved through housing renovations and new affordable housing, coupled with increased economic development.Gigha has several businesses which support employment on the island and IGHT now employs  people across its office, maintenance team, Achamore Gardens, new campsite, marketing, and ranger service.This includes two apprentices who are contributing to the restoration of Achamore Gardens.The trust is managed by a board of voluntary directors who are elected by the membership to develop the assets of the island and take forward plans and projects for the community.IGHT  retains ownership of the majority of the built and land assets of the island, worth over £m.Since the buy-out in  IGHT has renovated  houses as part of an ongoing investment programme, sold  plots for private self-build development, developed four wind turbines which help fund development, installed moorings and pontoon facilities, successfully marketed Gigha’s tourism assets as well as working to protect and conserve Gigha’s heritage and environment.One of the trust’s biggest challenges has been managing its financial position.The trust’s debt levels increased to £.m in  after taking out loans to deliver housing renovations.This debt burden is now reduced to £,, which has been achieved through asset sales and income from its renewable and trading companies.The trust has a number of projects underway including a new campsite, km of new and upgraded path networks, on-site and online heritage interpretation, five new housing units, and a -year restoration plan for Achamore Gardens.The trust is actively trying to reduce the island#s carbon footprint through  e-bikes for hire from the activity centre and is also soon to install the island#s first electric vehicle charging point."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Its kirkyard gives testimony to the thriving trades that existed here, and the personal struggles and tragedies of families who lived in harsher times.The Witches Stone in Spott I heard once that a minister not so long ago oversaw the recording of the graves, many of which are now worn by the sea winds which sweep over this beautul but exposed place.One gravestone is so worn by the weather a hole has appeared in its centre. I stood by it and hoped that the story it once told had been caught before the words finally vanished.I showed Suu the jougs which hang at the entrance to the kirk: a metal collar attached to the wall by a chain.Here its victims would be chained up, humiliating them and exposing them to the judgement of other members of the community who deemed themselves morally superior, or at least hoped their own transgressions would never be discovered.It was the poor, of course, who were subject to such humiliations, and women in particular, not the rich and powerful men who made the rules they set for others.As we stood by the kirk, I told Suu the well-kent tale of the Rev John Kello, who was minister at Spott after the Reformation.A memorial to the women ly executed as witches Despite his pious pontications and apparent high moral standards, he murdered his poor long-suffering we Margaret because of greed. He then tried to make it look like suicide.The fact he stood in the kirk, giving a sermon on morality, holding the Bible with the same hands which he had used, just an hour before, to strangle his we to death, is breathtaking in its horror and hypocrisy.But actually at the heart of this crime is misogyny, a contempt and hatred of women, which was, and is, far from unusual.Kello was eventually caught out and confessed that is the unusual part of the story, not the murder. Women regularly died at the hands of partners and, despite changes and progress, they still do.The jougs were just part of that system of misogyny, a terror of humiliation that dangled before them as they went to church, a reminder that they had a place set for them by men they best not challenge.I took a photo of the jougs and accidentally caught Suu’s shadow as well.The image seemed symbolic of the many women history has forgotten, or didn’t even notice, who remain unnamed shadows in the events catalogued by self-important men.Further down the road, there is another place which shows the final societal conclusion of this perception of women: the Witches’ Stone.Jougs at Spott Parish Church It stands on a site where, it is said, women were horribly executed for the trumped-up crime of witchcraft as late as .There is no space here to get into the debate about which women actually met their end here, and when, and what the evidence tells us.There are times that historical pedantry is promoted on this issue, usually by men, which ignores the very real horror of these events.Suffice to say, this is a location that bears the memory,not all the names, of many women who were persecuted by a system and ideology which had misogyny at its heart.There are statistics, of course: , accused of witchcraft in Scotland, the vast majority women, with evidence that more than , were actually executed, many in or from East Lothian.The real number will be more, and even then statistics don’t tell even half the story.Many of those accused who managed to avoid being ‘worrit’ at the stake will still have had their lives ruined in so many ways. They will have lived with the vilication and suspicions.None of these women were guilty of being witches who had made a pact with the Devil.That was nonsense.They were mothers, healers, midwives, grandmothers, poor servants, old women, young women, usually poor women many were convicted on evidence we would now recognise as compassion and care for others.They were victims of the misogyny cast in the iron of the jougs. Their real crime was being a woman.That’s why I support the move by the Scottish Government to have a full legal pardon for all those who suffered from the insane brutality of the witch hunts. Men were victims too, but it was overwhelmingly women.It’s not just about historical justice, it’s about recognising that while, thankfully, times have changed a lot, they still haven’t changed enough.Misogyny isn’t historical, it’s very current and very real today, all over the world, as well as on our doorstep.That’s why a national monument would be a good idea too, in addition to recognising the local memorials such as the one at Spott, and in my home town of Prestonpans.They need to be made accessible too, not tucked away on a dangerous corner of a road where there is no safe place to stand and remember.And let’s stop calling the women witches, because they weren’t what they were accused of being.And as we commemorate their persecution, let’s also celebrate their role in society, their bravery, their talents and contributions."},{"url":null,"title":"schoolchildren-visit-scottish-parliament-first-time-since-pandemic-began","story":"Students visited Holyrood as part of the Scottish Parliament’s education visits programme to learn more about the work of MSPs – a trip that was not possible for almost two years due to coronavirus restrictions.Two Higher modern studies classes attended Holyrood last Tuesday and were met by Martin Whitfield and Brian Whittle, South Scotland MSPs.Mr Whitfield, who was previously East Lothian’s MP and a teacher at Dirleton Primary School, was delighted to welcome the pupils to the Capital.He said: “The suspension of public visits to Parliament has been one of many disappointing impacts of the pandemic over the last two years.“It was a pleasure to meet the Knox Academy students and answer some of their questions, and I look forward to welcoming many more young people from other local schools over the course of this parliamentary session.”S pupil Mara Popa described it as “an amazing experience for everyone” and said: “During this time, we were able to ask our MSPs questions about what an MSP does, committees that they are members of, and how they can hold the Government to account.”"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-1997-1972-1922","story":"THE school bell was ringing for the last time for Dunbar Grammar School’s headteacher, reported the East Lothian Courier on March , .Will Collin today walks through the gates of Dunbar Grammar School for the last time as headteacher.After almost  years in the senior post, and five years before that as assistant head, he is taking early retirement at the age of .Explaining his decision, Mr Collin said: “I feel I am ready for retirement and putting my feet up.”Born and raised in Eyemouth, he began teaching maths and physics at the high school there in .Five years later he moved to Arbroath before coming to Dunbar as assistant headteacher in .Following an -month sojourn as the deputy head of Selkirk High School in the early s, he ed to Dunbar in .Looking back over a career spanning three decades at the school, Mr Collin, who lives with his we Val in Rosebery Place, said: “The best part of the job is working with young people.”...and  years agoVandals created ‘a reign of terror’, told the East Lothian Courier on March , .A wave of vandalism in East Lothian recently was likened to a “reign of terror” by a county official this week.He said damage amounting to almost £, had been done to a pavilion in Prestonpans.“We are fighting a losing battle,” said Mr George B.

The developer of Hallhill North would also need to pay for the development of the new football pitch and the changing rooms.The planning application also included a play area and open space in front of the primary school. That all has planning approval and work will proceed on site before the summer. However, a group of concerned parents were at the same time looking for a site to locate a skate park and pump track in Dunbar they did a presentation to the community council on their ideas. I have for the last several months been working with these parents and iniduals.We are aware that skateboarding and BMX bikes are now Olympic sports and the idea of linking these facilities with the fantastic sporting facilities we have at Hallhill developed into the idea of locating it on the land we have available at Lochend. We have been developing this idea and, along with the changing rooms, we feel that a community cafe would be fantastic for our young people when they use this area. It would provide some supervision for the area and provide toilets and refreshments for the people using the facility.We are all aware of the anti-social behaviour that has been taking place within our community. Our young people are currently using Lochend Woods at nights and over the weekends to meet up but have no supervision and are getting involved in anti-social behaviour. We see lots of complaints about our young people on social media and now all young people have been banned from using McDonald’s in the evenings. The situation will not improve and will become dangerous unless we do something to support them. We need to provide these young people somewhere they can meet up in a safe area along with some supervision.The outdoor activity can be used by anyone despite their age, sex or ability. I would expect to see adults and children using this facility at the same time along with some quality coaching in all activities. We are fortunate in Dunbar that many of our young people use skateboards, scooters, roller skates and bikes they will all benefit from using this facility. My hope is all our young people can feel this is a place they can come and feel safe and be involved, or just sit in the cafe with friends for a chat.As for the woodland, I am fully committed to doing everything I can to protect it and the wildle within it. We need to find a way of engaging with our young people to respect it and support the work we need to do protect it and its wildle. I hope the new centre will make young people think they are part of the community woodland and will want to be involved.I am committed to delivering this project on the ground quickly, as I did with the Hallhill Sports Complex that was £ million. I have already secured signicant funding to deliver this project soonI am re-elected as a councillor to represent my community.As for a facility at DunBear Park, at present we do not have any land, funding or a proposal and,it comes together, it could be five to  years away, but our young people need facilities now.NormanHampshireLeader, East Lothian Council"},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-pensioner-praises-aldi-staff-saving-pet-mauling-out-of-control-dog","story":"Andy Henderson, , and his West Highland terrier Angus were both attacked by an out-of-control Staffie while enjoying a walk in Haddington.Andy, who is currently battling stomach cancer, was dragged to the ground and bitten by the animal as he attempted to save four-year-old Angus from the attack.Workers from the nearby Aldi store rushed to Andy’s aid after hearing his screams for help and managed to fight the dog off before its owner ed and calmly took the animal away.Angus was left covered in blood after suffering puncture wounds to his face and neck and had to be rushed to a local vet for emergency treatment.Andy and we Caroline, , have now been left with a £ vet bill and are appealing for the dog’s owners to come forward.Police Scotland and East Lothian Council have also launched a hunt for the owner of the Staffie following the incident at Haddington Retail Park at about pm on Thursday.Andy, a taxi driver for the past  years, said: “Angus and I were walking past the Aldi store and I saw the Staffie tied up but only by a choke chain.“It must have slipped the chain as the next thing I knew it had jumped on Angus’s back and was growling and biting him.“I tried to grab it but it turned on me and bit me on the hand and dragged me to the ground as I struggled with it.‘Fortunately some guys from the Aldi shop must have heard me shouting as they came running out and tried their best to help us.“Some passers-by also helped and eventually they kicked and punched the dog so hard they managed to get it off us.“I can’t thank the shop staff enough asthey hadn’t jumped in to save us who knows what could have happened.“Angus was covered in blood and we had to rush him straight to the vet where he was cleaned up.“He had cuts and puncture wounds to his muzzle and his neck but we’ve been told he should recover alright.”Andy said after the attack that two men walked out of the Aldi store and grabbed hold of the Staffie before walking off without saying anything.He added: “The two guys just walked off with the dog butthey have anything about them then they should come forward to admit what has happened.“I would hate to think that it might be a child next time.”A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “Around pm on Thursday, March , police received a report of a dog attack at Haddington Retail Park.“Officers spoke to the reporter and gathered more information.

Holding back a smirk as he does so, the straight-talking celebrity chef announces the single is set to experience something of a revival, forming the basis of a brand new MasterChef challenge as part of the forthcoming series.Using the songs descriptive lyrics, \"things like crunchy, slimy, slippery, wobbly\" according to Torode, contestants must create an adjective-inspired dish, a task set to make their minds \"work in a very dferent way\".\"Its open to interpretation,\" says Torode. \"Whether it be sweet or savoury, it doesnt, in any way, have to be a cheesecake.\"Now, heading into its eighteenth series, the show is no stranger to embracing online trends. In fact, Torode estimates that three-quarters of the shows contestants admit to drawing culinary inspiration from the internet.Heaping praise on the instantaneous nature of social media, the chef says online s offer on-demand access to recipe ideas, making them \"much more accessible than a cookery book\".Recounting how a past contestant memorably skinned a salmon using only their hands, \"not with a kne, with his hand!\" exclaims the celebrity chef, the contestant in question attributed the trick to a YouTube video hed accidentally stumbled upon. Going on to describe the \"enormity\" of online food trends, Torode cryptically recalls how more recently a contestant \"did something odd with a prawn\", an idea also discovered whilst browsing videos, this time on social media  TikTok.\"Social media is quite an egalitarian playing field, isnt it \" adds fellow judge and former greengrocer Wallace, .\"Its evened things up considerably. Where before it may have actually been cookery school or parents that knew how to do it, now of course, there it is.\"A culinary journey that incorporates extreme highs and crippling lows where MasterChefs contestants are concerned, Torode says it is also worth sparing a thought for the health of both he and Wallace. Noting a single tasting session can easily see the pair consume upwards of  calories in a single sitting, filming can often be spread over five days, totalling an eye-wateringly caloric intake. It is something the health conscious pair are actively aware of, with Wallaces lockdown weight-loss transformation regularly flaunted across social media.\"Youve got to try and find a way of actually staying fit. And I think, at the same time, staying mentally fit,\" says Torode. Going on to describe the MasterChef filming process as \"draining\" and \"emotional\", the Australian-born chef says that le as a judge is actually a lot tougher than it looks.\"Regardless of what you think about us as judges - and we might be a bit mean, sometimes - its dficult to say to somebody: Im really sorry, but thats not cooked.\"The comments come as British culinary queen Dame Delia Smith labelled MasterChef \"awful\" for its hard-handed approach to criticism in a recent interview with The Daily Mail, describing it as \"the opposite\" of her own cookery style.It is a notion Wallace rejects, adding the \"problem\" with MasterChef is that it is a competition that can \"only have one winner\".\"Id like to think that any programme that celebrates cookery and celebrates achievement would be inspirational for people rather than off putting,\" says the presenter. \"Im not sure the Olympics puts people off running, and Im not sure that Wimbledon puts people off playing tennis.\"Despite highlighting the demands of the job, Wallace is also quick to admit that le as a MasterChef judge is not all doom and gloom. Describing how Torode, husband of actress Lisa Faulkner, is not one to talk about his personal le, he speaks on the chefs behalf when he describes the way in which the pairs attitudes towards le have changed with age.\"Were just two very old, comfortable, settled down, happy blokes,\" chuckles Wallace. \"Ill tell you what is happening, Im going classic and Johns getting younger as he gets older. He likes it more daring. Thats whats happening with the food.\"As with any long-running television series, change is all but to be expected. MasterChefs format is being shaken up with the introduction of multiple new rounds, including five weeks of auditions in which nine contestants create a signature dish served blindly to the judges.Paired with the all-new pressurised Chefs Table challenge featuring Gordon Ramsay, series  will see  hopeful amateurs, from an NHS worker to a beer bike tour guide, step behind their work benches in a bid to impress the professionals.\"MasterChef changes, because food changes,\" adds Torode. What does not change, however, is the frequency with which contestants succumb to the pressures of the MasterChef kitchen.With each new season comes a new, often bizarre stumbling block. A seemingly simple ingredient that brings the aspiring chefs dreams crashing down. Series seventeen saw lamb become the enemy, with contestants seeming unable to perfect a perfectly a finely cooked chop. This year, however, it seems the humble potato has becomes the contestants arch-nemesis, or to be more specic, \"raw potatoes\".\"Bloody potatoes. Just cook a potato. I mean for goodness sake, its a potato!\" exclaims Torode, himself on the verge of boiling over. \"You deep fry it, it becomes a chip. You put in some butter and stock, it comes a fondant. You boil it, it becomes mash. Just cook the bloody thing!\"But with the hearty carbohydrate clearly putting in a lacklustre performance this series, what is it that makes MasterChef a recipe for success  According to Torode, the answer is simple.\"Its bloody brilliant contestants, who are doing bloody brilliant things, who have gone on to create some bloody brilliant restaurants.\"MasterChef s to BBC on Wednesday, pm."},{"url":null,"title":"black-isle-childhood-proves-inspiration-rising-artist","story":"The Black Isle is known for its beachfront villages such as Rosemarkie and and a historic harbour at Avoch.And it was its openness and wild landscapes that proved to be such an inspiration for a Scots artist Erraid Gaskell who says her childhood growing up on the Black Isle is something she has never forgotten and enthused about being able to roam forests and fields.Read more: Nairn banker murder: Police hunt two men seen with handgun in areaLike many graduating students celebrations didnt go quite to plan in  as the country was plunged into a national lockdown.

There I experienced ‘Holi, the two-day Hindu spring festival, also known as ‘the festival of colours,’ which made a huge impact on me. You just couldn’t escape being surrounded by all the colours of the rainbow and to me these colours also represented the warmth and generosity of the people.”Ms Gaskell moved back to Scotland to continue her education at boarding school where an art teacher spotted her talent and encouraged her to experiment with colour and form. Although separated geographically, she remained close to her parents, calling them my \"biggest supporters”.“Both my mum and dad are very creative people and my mum has the most amazing eye. Wherever we lived in the world she had a real flair for making a home.”Her first major solo exhibition, ‘Fragments of Home,’ showcases a range of colourfully compelling pieces reflecting m Gaskells interpretation and memory of the dferent places she has lived - including the Australian Outback for a time after her parents orced.The family will be reunited on Sunday for her show - her father is coming over from Australia especially for the occasion.She remarked: “I couldn’t think of a better way to celebrate my graduation - and Mother’s Day.”  The Green Gallery is owned by Becky Walker who will also be marking Mother’s Day at Ms Gaskell’s exhibition. Ms Walkers mum, Ann Johnston, a professional painter, established the the gallery nearly  years ago and has also taught many well-known artists.Ms Walker, who now runs the business, said: “Mum is always on hand with advice and I’m very aware of her legacy of only showing good work of the highest quality.\"Erraid continues this tradition. She has very distinctive style and a level of artistic maturity that’s unusual for someone her age. As soon as I saw her paintings I knew she would be an artist very much in demand and I’m delighted to be giving people the opportunity to buy a piece of art to help create their own sense of home.”‘Fragments of Home,’ featuring the work of Erraid Gaskell will preview on Sunday, March  at the Greengallery from -pm.

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus. At this stage it’s just baby steps, andthe interest is enough, we’d like to resurrect the indoor winter league, which hasn’t been played since  .“If there is enough interest over in Caithness, we’d like to get the inter-county going too.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

He doesn’t always understand why there is a change. Monday, after being off over St Patrick’s weekend, was slightly less worrying. He still doesn’t quite understand why he isn’t going to school, but he was more accepting of it this morning.“As the day has gone on he has needed more and more reassurance. He’s constantly giving us his schedule and showing us his pictures for school.“Unfortunately we’re now telling him he’s not going to school again. He’s already showing his displeasure around that.“It may come across that this is an issue primarily with transport, but that’s not the case with my son’s school,” said Seamus.“If it was just a case of transport, myself and probably a lot of other parents would be able to try and make other arrangements to get the kids into school.

The union has said no.“Again, we’re just waiting for more information on what’s going to happen on Wednesday, and possibly Thursday and Friday.“I don’t think anybody would have any issues with the reasons that workers have for taking strike action. I’m sure it wasn’t an easy decision to go ahead with the strike, however, the likes of the special schools should always be exempt from industrial action.“We’re not talking about mainstream schools and kids who can carry on their learning at home, through online lessons. We’re talking about the most vulnerable in society who have already suffered immensely during the past couple of years with the pandemic.“Special schools always seem to be hit harder when something happens,” he said. “Some exemption should have been given to allow a school to be able to provide for those very vulnerable kids who suffer greatly when they can’t go in.“I’m not a politician, or an expert, but surely there could have been some sort of compromise “I can only speak for my son, but going back to the bad days of the pandemic, we’re talking meltdowns, complete and utter frustration, crying. He lives for his schedule and it’s not just about getting an education, it’s getting the therapies that are part of that special school. Like a lot of children, it’s not just the case of missing a certain lesson.“If Eoin continues to not be at school he will show extreme frustration. His behaviour will deteriorate.

They are supported by Duane Fitzsimons, from Ardglass, who is a walking trails expert.ldquoThe Columban Way forms part of the wider European lsquoVia Columbanirsquo heritage trail supported and promoted by the Council of Europe. It traces the route from Mount Leinster to Bangor through eight European countries to Bobbio in Italy, explained Cllr Enright.ldquoIt is instructive to see how rapidly other countries have rolled out sections of the trail since  and the th anniversary of Columbanus. Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany and the Low Countries have demonstrated the ability to deliver that we can learn from locally.Cllr Enright praised the support of Ards and North Down Council which has already delivered  miles of walk as far south as Comber.ldquoThis -mile section of trail is designed to encourage more people to learn about the history of North Down and Ards, including the impact the area had in a European context through the links with Columbanus, he explained.ldquoOur big challenge will be to engage with Newry Mourne and Down Council to deal with their huge gaps in the Saint Patrickrsquos and Ulster Ways.

But that could be about to change.Last year, the estimated repair bill for the clock, whose interior mechanism was removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, was in the region of pound,.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into continued disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come, reinforcing its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.The factory was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Now there is fresh hope that it can be restored to its former glory.Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey, who have been campaigning for the clockrsquos restoration, are also hopeful that progress can be made.Welcoming the recent developments, they hope plans to acquire the clock and restore it to its former glory will prove successful.The MLAs said Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long made it clear last year that the huge cost of repairing the historic clock was something the organisation was not willing to meet at the time.The housing chief said at a time when it was experiencing a signicant funding shortfall for investment in tenantsrsquo homes, it was not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration of the Shrigley clock.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey then raised the issue with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey, who has overall responsibility for the Historical Environment Division.They detailed the clockrsquos history and its local signicance, explaining that it is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in Shrigley.The MLAs said it was ldquounacceptable that an old clock of such important signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of disrepair.ldquoWe urged the communities minister to take the necessary steps to prevent this important listed monument from further deterioration and urged her to consider a partnership approach with ious interested bodies, explained Ms McIlveen.ldquoI am pleased that the Housing Executive is now in discussions with an interested local party regarding a proposed feasibility study to consider options and prepare design concepts for the area that would involve the acquisition and restoration of the historic monument.Ms McIlveen said discussions are ongoing and that she and Mr Harvey have made clear to the government department and Housing Executive their desire that these discussions should be centred on the interests of the Shirley community, with the outcome safeguarding the future of the cherished monument..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Council set to review museum joint curator restructure role  ","story":"THE controversial decision to restructure the districtrsquos museum services is to be reviewed.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos decision to appoint a joint curator to oversee museum services in Downpatrick and Newry mdash which was taken without consulting local councillors mdash is to be reviewed by the local authorityrsquos Audit Committee.The newly appointed curator will be based in Newry, a move which has angered a number of councillors and highly respected organisations, including the Friends of the Down County Museum.Council officials have been accused of downgrading the status of the Downpatrick museum with stinging criticism continuing of the decision to have one curator in charge of the local authorityrsquos two museums.Council officials insist they are ldquofully committed to the continuous improvement and development of both museums and that updated staffing structures for both ldquoprovides an unparalleled opportunity to build in this work.The restructuring process has been referred to the Audit Committee by Downpatrick councillor Gareth Sharvin, who is disappointed that despite signicant opposition to the move, the new joint curator is already in post.He wants the process which led to the councilrsquos decision to be reviewed, with the referral coming on the back of an update on the new staffing structure recently provided in secret to members of the local authorityrsquos Strategy, Policy and Resources Committee.Cllr Sharvin said while the press and public were prevented from hearing the update, he understands that the new curator will be based in Newry and shared across both museum sites.He continued: ldquoThe new staff structure is seen as an activity under the so-called scheme of delegation that enables the councilrsquos senior management team to conduct the change without the need to consult or inform any stakeholders in the process.ldquoThe new staff structure is currently being implemented and cannot be subject to change, as the roles have been offered out. We are told this is an operational matter that councillors are not involved in.Cllr Sharvin says he is disappointed to have to confirm that the new staff structure will be implemented at Down County Museum, which means it will have no permanent curator in the building.ldquoGiven the lack of information around the new roles and how the existing complement of skills are being integrated into the new museum structure, it can only raise concern as no one outside the senior management team have the information and understanding of how the fantastic services provided in Downpatrick will continue to be offered and delivered, he continued.ldquoThe campaign by the Friends of the Museum and the many groups associated with the Down County Museum was very much focused on the skills needed to run the museum and offer the excellent experience many hundreds of thousands of people have enjoyed over the years.Cllr Sharvin insists that a strategic review should have been undertaken first to understand the vision for the museum services in the district, design a plan around that vision and identy the staffing structure needed to support it.ldquoWhat has happened in this case, is that the staff structure is being implemented and a strategic review being held afterwards. The strategic review could easily identy that a dferent staffing structure is needed as opposed to the one being implemented now, he continued.ldquoI want to see the Down County Museum grow in size, reputation and service offerings. When you research the top  museums in Northern Ireland on Which Museum, the Downpatrick museum is placed th compared to Newry which is st.ldquoSimilarly on TripAdvisor, the Downpatrick museum is listed th, with Newry in th place. This shows a clear dference in status for each museum and where the councilrsquos main museum asset is.Councillor Sharvin explained he has referred the museum process and procedure to the councilrsquos Audit Committee for a number of reasons, even though he accepts the review will have no signicance in relation to the staffing structure as that will continue.However, he said the move will ensure that ldquolessons are learnt for any future changes and the Downpatrick museum is protected and respected.Cllr Sharvin explained the role of the audit committee is to review internal procedures and that is what he has asked to be examined.ldquoThere is no clear one approach when it comes to restructuring in council and the review of the procedures undertaken in this case will help the organisation identy were gaps are, what risks have been identied and the improvements that need to be implemented, he said.Cllr Sharvin said he has asked for a timeline of the start and completion of the strategic review being implemented and how key stakeholders such as the Friends of the Museum will be consulted as part of the process.He added: ldquoThe strategic review is now the focus of the campaign to ensure that the Down County Museum is not downgraded in any way. I will be approaching the strategic review with the sense of growth in visitor numbers, educational outreach, advertising campaigns, collection and exhibition offerings and the wider service offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dawn launches debut novel  ","story":"THE debut novel by a local childrenrsquos writer is already one of the top selling books in its age category on Amazon.Felicity Flipflops is the work of Dawn Gelston, a teacher living in Dubai but who has strong links with Drumaness and Teconnaught.She is the daughter of Paul and Maura Gelston and sister to Shona, Aisling, Janine and Paul.Aimed at children aged  to  years old, the book tells the story of mental well-being, adventure, and friendship by a young girl named Felicity.Dawn explained: ldquoAs teachers, we encourage children to believe in themselves and to work hard and dream big.

includes three  metre swimming lanes and a dedicated heated play pool for children.The new leisure facility will also feature an ultra-modern gymnasium and once demolition work has been completed, the new complex will be bolted on to the side of the existing centre.Redeveloping the existing Newcastle Centre has been ruled out due to the scale of the costs involved and itrsquos understood that the planned new-build will be larger than the current centre which is a listed building, posing major problems for the council in transforming it into an energy efficient facility which meets current building regulations and standards.Cllr Mason described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as ldquowelcome news and is delighted that the development plans are in the final stages of development.ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike, she said, confirming that the proposes new complex will feature a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.ldquoFor too long, people of Newcastle have had to put up with these substandard facilities, the chairwoman continued. ldquoThe plans highlighted safety concerns with the old part of the building which is to be demolished as it simply isnrsquot fit for purpose.Cllr Mason said she hopes to see the finalised plans and formal site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.ldquoIt is essential that the council moves in a timely manner to ensure this project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access these new facilities as soon as possible, said the chairwoman.ldquoSinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure these much-needed leisure facilities are delivered and I will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to deliver these essential services right in the heart of communities.Last week, formal planning approval to bulldoze the rear extension of the existing Newcastle Centre and the adjoining Tropicana swimming pool was agreed by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.Detailed work has already been carried out at the town centre site, including geotechnical surveys which examined ground conditions to provide architects and designers with key information ahead of construction work getting underway.While no detailed timescales are in place, politicians hope that major progress to deliver the project can now be made, with planning permission and all other associated approvals secured in a timely fashion..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Fin tasic with formation of new angling club  ","story":"A NEW course angling club has been formed in Downpatrick.Known as Quoile Angling Club, the organisation is holding its inaugural meeting this Friday night at Murphyrsquos Bar in the town at pm, with an open invitation extended to anyone who would like to attend.The club was formed in response to the growing interest in course angling at the river and with coronavirus restrictions largely gone, anglers have joined forces to form the new club and aim to encourage greater involvement in angling, particularly for coarse fish in the lower reaches of the River Quoile.The picturesque river is home to rudd, roach, hybrids, bream, pike, and eels.The new club is hoping to run a few competitions and, in the future, provide coaching courses for young anglers.A key concern for the new club is addressing the current state of the fishery which runs from the below the Belfast Road bridge to the Steamboat quay.The aim is to engage with a raft of statutory agencies to raise the profile of the river and its angling potential, alongside improved access for anglers and visitors.While there has been signicant investment over recent years and additional upgrades in the pipeline, the anglers will hope this paves the way for greater emphasis on the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset.Anglers say the Quoile basin is a designated nature reserve and, as such, there are ious regulations which govern its usage, with those who fish along its banks keen to maintain the waterwayrsquos biological ersity and general appearance, ensuring it is an asset everyone can enjoy.At the clubrsquos inaugural meeting this Friday evening, members will adopt a constitution and select a new management committee.

He was inch-perfect through the morningrsquos slippery conditions, quickly building up a sizeable advantage and catching his rivals on the hop.This continued his fine form after the local driver also won the opening stages.In the space of two stages, he had amassed a lead of more than  seconds ndash a huge margin on the single venue event.From there, he managed his lead and with the sun shining, Greer powered home in his Citroen C to eventually win by . seconds and claim another maximum points haul in his bid for this yearrsquos championship spoils.ldquoIt was a brilliant day, said Greer.ldquoThe car was faultless and was really well suited to the event. We kept it clean and everything went to plan.In the battle for second overall, Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson held an early second in their Skoda until a stage two overshoot cost them around ten seconds.Aaron McLaughlin and Darren Curran also hit trouble with a puncture and a broken rim, while Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson were already out of contention after they spun and stalled on stage one.That left McGarrity and McLaughlin battling for the runner-up spot. McLaughlin quickly recovered from his puncture and moved into second after stage three. McGarrity tried hard to fight back but in the drying conditions, McLaughlin had the edge in his Fiesta WRC.He was really enjoying himself and an attempt to secure the fastest time on the final stage saw him come to within one-tenth of a second of rally winner Greer.ldquoHersquos a machine, said McLaughlin.ldquoI was really hoping for a fastest stage time. I just wish we had started the day as good as we finished it.Derek McGarrity and Graham Henderson had to be content with third overall in their Skoda. Their stage two overshoot potentially cost them a position but they still secured an armful of points for their McGrady Insurance NI Championship campaign.ldquoIt was a silly mistake on the second stage, said McGarrity.ldquoThen we had a small misfire on the last stage but it is what it is.Joe McGonigle and Ciaran Geaney clipped a bale and damaged the front wing of their Fiesta on stage two but they survived to tell the tale.Seventh after the test, they climbed back up the order to secure fourth overall ahead of Joe and Ashleen Hegarty, who were lucky to escape a high-speed spin on stage four.ldquoWe were using new tyres and the car broke away from me at high speed, explained Hegarty.ldquoWe went over a few trackside tyres and ended up on the grass.Darren Gass and Sam Hutchinson would have been in the mix too but they took a wrong route on stage five and were handed a stage maximum. Instead, Michael McGarrity and Damien Garvey were overjoyed to claim sixth overall in their Fiesta.They lost time when a boost pipe came adrt and also struggled with some brakingissues during the closing miles but were full of smiles at the finish.Also in a Fiesta, David Kelly and Dean OrsquoSullivan finished seventh ahead of Mark Massey and Alistair Wyllie.Massey was lucky to escape with some superficial bodywork damage after a stage five altercation with some trackside stage furniture so a top eight finish was a good result for the crew.Emma McKinstry and Kenny Hull lost time with some intercom issues but finished ninth while Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson completed the top ten and secured the two-wheel-drive honours in the process.In the two-wheel-drive category, a titanic battle developed between a number of crews. James and Heather Kennedy were quickest out of the blocks, closely followed by Andrew White and Paul Hughes.Then White lost ground with an overshoot, leaving Kennedy to fend off a challenge from Robert Erwin and Andrew Wilson.As the track conditions improved, Erwin started to pile the pressure on the Kennedys who were suffering with a down-on-power engine.The chasing Toyota MR crew moved in front after the fth test and another strong run over the final stage sealed the category win as well as tenth overall.James and Heather Kennedy had to settle for second on this occasion as well as th overall, with Matthew McGaffin and Ryan Lowry coming home third in class.The McGrady Insurance NI Rally Championship now has a two-month break before the Maiden City Stages on May .In the interim period, a rally social night is being held at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel on Friday, March .

In  it was decided to move both date and venue to have the best chance of fitting in with Covid- restrictions.While the event at Bishopscourt Racing Circuit last June was well received, many were glad to see the race brought back to its origins as a road race taking in the iconic sites of East Downrsquos home town.Months of planning go into a race and this year was no exception. The EDAC race committee had an A and B routes on file in case of flooding on the Quoile towpath.They had worked with and through Covid- restrictions, secured road licences and Athletics NI permits, and employed professionals for timing, first aid and traffic management among others.The club rallied members and friends of the club to marshal the roads, man the water station and prepare the post race food tables.The race committee were out at am on Sunday to finalise the cones and signage when news broke that a fallen tree had brought down a power line directly impacting the planned route.East Down AC volunteers were straight into action. They were at the scene in minutes and had even a tree surgeon on speed dial, but they could not gain access.They were determined not to cancel and set about re-routing the race. This is not as simple as it may seem. With a traffic management plan to take into account and new sections to measure as well as the clock ticking, there was a lot of pressure.The wind and rain didnrsquot help and mindful of the wellbeing of runners, a delayed start was not even considered.With some sharp thinking and speedy manoeuvres a new route was hurriedly drawn up.Having advised the athletes that it was no longer a measured K, the start team herded them on to the start line in Ballydugan Estate and the hooter went only a minute or two behind schedule.With a huge sigh of relief Mags Mathieson, the official starter, waved the  strong crowd on their way. Thankfully everything  went to plan and post race comments have been nothing but positive from those who took part.There was high praise for the volunteers along the route, who cheered, clapped and gave out water. It was not the race that East Down AC had planned but with  fresh in our memories, most were simply glad that they got the chance to run.With all that had gone on pre-race there was barely time to consider who the winner might be, but there was a wave of excitement when Neil McCartan of East Down appeared in the home straight and crossed the line  seconds ahead of Owen Carleton of Annadale Striders.This was a bucket list moment for Neil as he is a longtime club member and he ran well to achieve it.It tops off a great season so far and leaves him primed for the track season which is his first love. When Aaron McGrady, also EDAC, was third, the stress of the morning was washed away in the joy of having two members on the podium.Mal McGrady of M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants presented Neil with the Jimmy Murray Memorial Shield at the finish line and the top three received cash prizes.The ladiesrsquo race was almost pre-determined when Emma Mitchell ndash the current , metre track championndash decided to throw her hat in the ring.However, given that she has been targeting half marathon timesand that the pandemic has played havoc with both racing and training, it is hard to gauge where iniduals are form wise.In the end she had a clear win finishing in . with Sinead Murtagh of Newcastle and District AC taking second place in ..Eimear McCracken of City of Lisburn came third in . to complete the podium.Emma was presented with the Joe Quinn Perpetual Trophy for first female and she took the time to say that she was delighted to support the magnicent Jimmyrsquos Ten and that the hospitality from the host club was first class.From an athlete who has raced at top level all over the world, it was praise indeed.Two shields are presented for club teams in the K and this year Newcastle and District took the honours in the menrsquos race and East Down AC retained the ladiesrsquo title.It is based on the top four men and the top three women home. There is also a relay event where two people split the K with one runner starting on the line and then passing over a wristband at the changeover point.Their team-mate then heads home to record a joint time. Ollie Robinson and Jacob Crawfordwere the quickest all male team.Holly Scott and Willow Farrington of Scrabo took the all female prize and the mixed title went to mother and son duo Maureen Kelly and James Wright .With the podiums decided the spectators turned their attention to looking for friends and family.The race is a highlight for local runners, many of whom do not belong to a club. This does not mean that they are not well able and plenty of fast times were recorded as the runners flooded in.Some were running to test their pace, some to seethey could run the distance with no speed in mind, others were raising funds or dedicating their run to causes.In short, there were all sorts of reasons and all sorts of runners but they were united in their efforts and the thrill of crossing a line to cheers.The fact that they were then brought to tables laden with food was a big surprise as for so long hospitality has been withdrawn, but with restrictions eased and a bit of careful planning the hosts were able to entertain their guests outside.Even the weather played ball by that stage as the rain had stopped and there were shreds of sunlight to lt the atmosphere.Jimmyrsquos Ten is always a memorable event but the  event will definitely be lodged in peoplersquos minds as the race that went ahead against all odds.EDAC would like to pay tribute to their full list of sponsors McMahon People Solutions, PCG Fitness, MC Dental Laboratories, Duffyrsquos Killough, JS Flooring, Murdock Brothers , P. Gardiner Carpets, Bells Supervalu Crossgar, McDonalds Downpatrick, Gordons Chemists, Plusprint, Wrap and Roll, McVeigh Traffic Management, Soaring Productions and main sponsor M.B. McGrady and Co Chartered Accountants. The financial backing is what makes this race an event.Thanks are also due to the members and even more so to those who are simply friends of the club, who give up their time to make the race happen. The hard graft that they put in cannot be underestimated.Finally, last but not least, there is heartfelt gratitude towards every single runner who signed up.Without runners there is no race. The smiles of the finishers and the kind words of support post race make all the hard work worthwhile. Well done and see you all next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Kilmore overrun Grove in league  ","story":"KILMORE Rec kept their promotion hopes on track with an impressive one-sided victory over a physical Grove United outfit at Robert Adams Park on Saturday.An early penalty kick converted by Anton McGrattan and two further second half goals from Eoin McGrattan and Joe McKinney was enough to see The Blues home and dry in bitterly cold yet sunny conditions.The Blues came firing out of the traps from the first whistle with Kilmore striker Joe McKinney the first to try his luck within the opening minutes, although his effort trickled harmlessly into the gloves of Grove number one Michael Davidson.However, it wouldnrsquot be long until the home side opened their account and after six minutes they were awarded the opportunity to do just that.Following a long ball over the top, Kilmore midfielder Eoin McGrattan spun his marker before he was clumsily clattered from behind inside the danger area.The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty kick, which Anton McGrattan dispatched confidently by drilling his effort low and hard to the bottom left corner beyond the reach of Davidson.The Bluesrsquo good start continued as they relentlessly pressed the opposition and didnrsquot allow Grove out of their own half.McKinney danced his way past three opposing defenders before his opportunity at goal was thwarted by a wonderfully timed last ditch tackle from Grove defender David McCallen.This wouldnrsquot deter the ever-dangerous Kilmore marksman, who continued to be a thorn in the side of his United counterparts when he battled to win back the ball before laying off team-mate Patrick Grant for a shot at goal.Grantrsquos effort did swing wide of the post but it was an encouraging sign for the Kilmore team, who clearly had their tails up.Man of the match, Barry Walsh, was enjoying the freedom of the middle of the park, as the Kilmore newcomer flung himself into every tackle necessary in order to gain possession for The Blues.Grove were very much stuck in first gear and were being overran in essentially every area of the park. Kilmore were dealt a blow when Grant came off second best in a crunching tackle with Grove defender Adam McKnight, leading to The Bluesrsquo defender to be substituted on  minutes.However, the silver lining for the hosts came in the form of substitute Joshua Smyth, who made an immediate impact when he entered the fray.Smyth quickly gained possession and whipped in a fast-paced cross to the head of incoming team-mate John McCarthy, whose effort was stunningly saved from point blank range by the reaction of Davidson in the Grove goals.This garnered applause from the sizeable home crowd, who had turned out to support their local side.With half an hour played, Kilmore looked to inflict further damage and almost did so following an eye-catching move which was unfortunate not to double the deficit.Smyth was yet again involved as he played a delicate one-two with the back heel of McKinney before his pass inside to the chest of Eoin McGrattan allowed the midfielder to find team-mate Michael Carvill unmarked at the edge of the box.Carvill unleashed an effort towards goal but it was smartly stopped yet again by Grove custodian Davidson, who was quickly becoming his sidersquos top performer.Any hint of a counterattack from the visitors was quickly dealt with by the confident backline of Christopher Magee, Gary Kennedy and captain Jack Larkin, with Magee in particular winning his inidual battle with Grove striker Jake Long time after time.With less than ten minutes to the interval, Carvill played a short free-kick to McCarthy, who swtly passed to Kennedy  yards from goal.After examining his options, the Kilmore defender decided to take a touch forward before firing a long ranged effort with conviction which ultimately crashed onto the post before falling to the feet of skipper Larkin.The Kilmore captain turned his rebound over the bar although his blushes were saved by the offside flag.Despite Grove proving they were a physically strong side ndash as they never shied away from a tackle ndash they failed to garner any substantial chance throughout the opening  minutes.The half ended with Grove midfielder David Johnston picking up a yellow card for a late challenge on Anton McGrattan.The first real opportunity of the second half fell to Kilmorersquos Walsh, who after a pinball of passes, saw his effort from the edge of the box saved.However, just two minutes later and The Blues would double their scoring tally after marksman McKinney latched on to a long ball before squaring his pass to team-mate Eoin McGrattan for an easy tap in.To their credit, Grove were certainly showing more of a presence in the opposing final third, although they were lacking the end product required to trouble the hosts.Kilmore continued to cause problems and goal-scorer Eoin McGrattan almost added another when he once again showed his marker a clean pair of heels and barrelled down on goal.This time his effort struck the side netting as Grove momentarily escaped conceding a third.The home side refused to settle for just two goals and were almost granted a third when McKinneyrsquos whizzing pass across the box marginally escaped the boot of the onrushing McCarthy.Grove managed to manufacture a seldom chance when captain Michael McNerlin struck a first time volley from  yards which required Kilmore lsquokeeper Christopher Turley to spring into action and tip the ball over the crossbar.However, this seemed to ignite the Kilmore flame further and with  minutes to go they registered their third, courtesy of a surging Walsh run which ended in a pass to McKinney inside the box.The Kilmore striker kept his cool and confidently placed his right footed effort into the net to drown out any chance of a dramatic comeback.Eoin McGrattan made way for substitute John Patterson, who almost added to the scoreline when once again McKinney was allowed to play a pass across goal.However, the substitute fluffed his lines and sent his effort over the bar in what was an escape for the now weathered looking Grove outfit.The visitors were gted a consolation goal in the th minute, after substitute David Long was adjudged to be fouled in the area by Kilmore captain Larkin.Grove midfielder Johnston confidently tucked his effort into the top right corner but seconds later the final whistle sounded.Following the match Kilmore goal-scorer, Anton McGrattan, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance.ldquoI thought we controlled the game, he said.ldquoWe could have gotten two or three goals before half-time but we didnrsquot panic.ldquoWe will just take it one game at a time now, we had a setback against Dromara Village a couple of weeks ago but we have now won two on the bounce.He added: ldquoThere is a massive week ahead, we travel to Rosario for a big three points.Kilmore Rec: C Turley, C Magee, P Grant, J Larkin , G Kennedy, B Walsh, J McCarthy, A McGrattan, J McKinney, M Carvill, E McGrattan.Subs: J Patterson, J Smyth, C

This has been an incredibly stressful and anxious time for so many of our population and no less so for our GP workforce and their teams who have been in the vanguard of our response to Covid.South Down UUP councillors Jill Macauley and Alan Lewis also paid tribute to Dr Smith.ldquoAlison has served the community of Clough and Dundrum with such attention and dedication over the years, and we have no doubt that her presence will be missed in the local surgeries, their statement said.ldquoWe thank our party colleague and Health Minister Robin Swann MLA for taking the time to call with Alison and all the staff at Clough Health Centre to acknowledge her retirement, as well as seeing around their impressive state of the art facilities.Dr Smith and her husband moved to the Newcastle area in  when he got a job at the YMCA.Originally from Edinburgh and having qualied at Edinburgh University, Dr Smith spent a short time working on the surgical ward of Downe Hospital with Mr Crawford Bell, consultant surgeon.She then worked part-time with Dr Edith Cunningham in Killyleagh and Dr John Kyle in Newcastle before joining the Dundrum and Clough Family Practice as a partner with Dr Kieran Walshe and Dr Alex Greer in . She replaced Dr Ronald Hamilton.Dr Smith said that while she is looking forward to having some time to spend with her family and to travel, she will greatly miss her patients and all the practice staff.ldquoItrsquos been a very exciting, go-ahead practice to be part of and our list has more than doubled since I joined, she said.ldquoItrsquos a lovely team to work with and I will miss all my colleagues and staff terribly after I go, particularly after Covid when our le was so restricted at home.ldquoThe last two years have been quite bizarre in many ways the team has really come together. This is history that we have actually been living and working through which has been good to have been part of that. But I definitely feel ready to move on and itrsquos time for new doctors to be in the practice.She said it was the speed of change that the practice had to contend with at the beginning of the lockdown that proved challenging.ldquoThere is always change in general practice and some of it is not easy but having to work safely through the pandemic while providing a service to our patients was challenging but I think we managed to do that.Dr Smith, who has three adult children mdash Alistair, Sandy and Corinne mdash added that it has been quite emotional for her saying goodbye to her patients over the last few weeks.ldquoThey are like old friends and it was good to be part of their lives. Itrsquos a privilege to be helping people at some of their worst times of their lives.She and her husband are looking forward in several weeks time to welcoming Corinne home from the US for the first since the pandemic.Dr Smith intends to continue to remain on the board of two local charities, MyMy in Newcastle and RIOT in Dundrum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Patrick Kielty’s love for Northern Ireland  ","story":"PATRICK Kielty has talked about his le, his loves, his passion for Northern Ireland and growing up in Dundrum.Patrick was interviewed by Gerry Kelly last Wednesday night as part of the lsquoIn Conversationrsquo series at the Saint Patrick Centre.He also revealed his thoughts on fatherhood, Brexit and the peace process.Reflecting on his childhood, Patrick recalled the terrible news of the murder of his father, Jack, and how looking back it seemed odd that there wasone bus for one community to go to school and another for the other.ldquoBrexit really was a wake-up call for me, he said and outlined his determination to find common ground. ldquoWeird and wonderful things happen when you decide to share.Patrick also described how he had jumped on a plane after a late night telephone call to his now-we Cat Deely and surprised her the next day in Los Angeles for her birthday lunch.ldquoThe taxi driver from the airport turned to me and said lsquoDo you want me to wait for you rsquo.Even after almost ten years of marriage he said he couldnt believe his luck and joked that being on the red carpet with his we, who is so successful in America, sometimes made people think ldquohes someone sponsored by a charity tagging along.The St Patrickrsquos Choral Society, who are celebrating their th anniversary this year, sang at the sold-out event mdash their first public engagement in over two years.St Patrickrsquos Grammar School student Eva Rowan, who hasjust won the BBC School Young Soloist of the Year competition, performed as part of the evening.The next in the series of events is a conversation on April  with Richard Moore, who was blinded by a rubber bullet in Derry in .Having forgiven and befriended Charles, the soldier who shot him, he has been celebrated world wide as a peace maker by the like of the Dalai Lama and is often described as the lsquoDerry Lamarsquo.Charles will also be part of the conversation by videolink.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMark Drakeford is scheduled to announce the results of the latest review on Friday, while health minister Eluned Morgan will give a press conference at lunch time today, Tuesday, on the latest situation regarding Covid-.A spokesman for the Welsh Government said the future of policies like mask-wearing will be announced on Friday.Earlier this month, the first minister said he hoped the nations remaining rules could be scrapped at the end of this month, given the improving situation.But a recent rise in infection rates may yet cause a few bumps in the road out of the pandemic. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon decided to keep mask rules in place there for another month, despite ending the rest of the nations Covid rules on Monday.It means people in Scotland must continue to wear face coverings on public transport and in shops - the same rules that we currently have in Wales - throughout April.England, however, has operated without any coronavirus rules for nearly one month, after Boris Johnson introduced his Living With Covid plan at the end of February.Public Health Wales confirmed , new cases on Monday , and nearly one in seven patients currently in Welsh hospitals has coronavirus. But infection rates remain well below the levels seen during the height of the Omicron wave in December and January. :Given the current Covid situation, the Argus asked the Welsh Governmentit was confident the nations remaining Covid restrictions would be lted when ministers reviewed the rules this week.We also askedthe Welsh Government believed it was currently safe to lt those restrictions.A spokesman for the government did not respond directly to those questions, but said: \"Throughout the pandemic we have kept regulations under regular review, with our approach being informed by the latest available scientic and medical advice. The outcome of the current -day review of regulations will be confirmed on March .\".removeEvenWales abandons its Covid rules on Friday, it is highly unlikely Mr Drakeford will follow the \"clf-edge\" approach seen in England. The first minister has criticised Mr Johnson for the abrupt end to restrictions over the border, and reinforced his own beliefs in the \"step by step\" strategy preferred in Wales.That strategy will involve a gradual winding down of most of the public-service response to coronavirus in Wales.Testing will continue here for the next three months, but lateral flow tests will be used instead of more expensive PCR tests during that time.Likewise, self-isolation policies will continue until the end of June, but they will become a matter of advice - not a legal requirement - from the end of March.We will bring you all the updates from Eluned Morgans Welsh Government coronavirus press conference at midday today, Tuesday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityWith England having removed all of its covid restrictions, it comes as little surprise that the Welsh Government is fielding calls to follow in Boris Johnson’s footsteps.Following this, it was announced that a decision will be made on the future of restrictions in Wales on Thursday, March , ahead of first minister Mark Drakeford’s three week review the following day - Friday, March .If the public health situation allows for it, an announcement lting restrictions in Wales will follow, the Welsh Government said.But, the BA. strain of covid has recently emerged, and it is growing – having overtaken omicron as the most prevalent iant in Wales.As a result, the situation is finely poised, with restrictions disappearing, additional measures being put in place, or continuing in an uneasy middle ground all on the table.Speaking at a briefing earlier today - Tuesday, March  - health minister Eluned Morgan summed it up, saying: “It is going to be a very finely balanced judgement in terms of whether we continue with our planned approach to releasing those final restrictions which we still have in place here.”Below, you can find out more about all of the moving parts in place, before the decision can be made.Why restrictions should be ltedNeighbouring England has lted all of its restrictions, and with many commuting across the border from Newport and Gwent - and vice-versa - there is a logical argument to bring the two nations in line.From a data point of view, Wales is actually in the best place of any of the home nations to lt restrictions.Wales currently has the lowest case rate in the UK - lower than England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.Health minister Eluned Morgan and The Grange hospital, one of the frontline hospitals in the fight against the virus What’s more, the omicron covid wave appears to be under control.Ms Morgan said: “Since the end of January, we have seen a steady decline in cases of coronavirus as the winter omicron wave receded”..removeSo, based on the above, all restrictions should be lted  Unfortunately, there are a number of other factors at play.Why restrictions should remainWhile omicron might be on the decline, there is a new menace in town – the BA. covid strain.In the last three weeks, the number of covid cases per , people in Wales has more than doubled, well above  per , people.BA. has also overtaken omicron as the most prevalent strain.BA. has now overtaken omicron But perhaps the biggest reason to keep restrictions in place is the pressure that the NHS once again finds itself under.There are more than , people in hospital with the virus, and, while most of these are not in intensive care, it is the highest hospitalisation rate since March .Simply put, the NHS is creaking once again.So, what decision can we expect It might sound like a bit of a cliché, but the decision as to whether restrictions will be lted could come down to the wire.The Welsh Government is set to make a decision on Thursday, before announcing it on Friday.Ms Morgan said: “It is going to be a very finely balanced judgement in terms of whether we continue with our planned approach to releasing those final restrictions which we still have in place here.\"There are no foregone conclusions. Were analysing the data, were giving ourselves as much time as we can. We will act in the best interest of the NHS and the public health in Wales.\"We have got to consider the pressures on the NHS at the minute. Our hospitals are full already. Any additional new pressure is going to lead to more dficulties in terms of access to accident and emergencies, dficulties with getting ambulances to people. All of those things will be considered as well.\"These are dficult judgements. Weve always tried to follow the science, but this is going to be a finely balanced judgement.\"It may be that well be keeping some restrictions, but there are no decisions that have been made so far.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityDavid Hill, , died on Saturday while playing rugby for a cross-party team from the Scottish Parliament in Dublin against the Dail and Seanad XV.The Dumfries-born staffer and campaigner was most recently the head of office for Tory justice spokesman Jamie Greene – who led the tributes in Holyrood on Tuesday. vw,vw,px, px\"Jamie Greene said Mr Hill had died ‘doing what he loved’ “We politicians like to speak, but this is one speech I would rather not be making,” Mr Greene said.“The news of the sudden passing of our friend and colleague David Hill came as a shock to each and every one of us, but the outpouring of messages of condolence also has been overwhelming.“I hope that brings some comfort to his family – reading the many messages of kindness from across the political spectrum and watching today’s proceedings.”He added: “He passed away on Saturday afternoon doing what he loved – playing rugby with his friends.“David was a people person – a true gentleman. He was kind, generous, respected and well liked. He was a friend to all.”Mr Greene, who was visibly emotional as he paid tribute to his friend, spoke of Mr Hill’s love of rugby, saying: “As it so often does, sport brings together those with dferences of opinion and dferent views, and it forges unlikely friendships and alliances.”The Tory MSP said Mr Hill’s father Rodger had told him his son had died “living his best le”.“Isn’t that the highest accolade or aspiration for any of us ” he said.“He was taken from us living his best le, doing what he loved with the people that he loved.”Mr Greene also stressed the importance of political staff to elected representatives.“We often spend more time with our staff here than we do with our families and friends, and I’m sure my team WhatsApp messages drove David to utter distraction – but he never, ever once complained,” Mr Greene said..remove“Because our staff are always there for us they shield us, they support us, they humour us and they do so with a sort of humility and patience that I can only aspire to.”He added: “When we applaud David in the response to the remarks spoken today, let us also applaud each and every one of our own respective teams too.“Because David’s legacy will be his passion for crossing political boundaries and isions with no motivation other than to simply be kind.“That is a lesson we could all learn – let us be kind and friendly to one another as David was to us.“Let us all be a little more like David as we go about our business.”Before Mr Greene’s statement, Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone, herself visibly emotional, said MSPs were “shocked and saddened” to learn of Mr Hill’s death.Justice Secretary Keith Brown also expressed his and the SNP group’s condolences over Mr Hill’s death..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Parliamentary tributes paid to  utrue gentleman u Tory staffer article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: PA Twickenham Stadium, London​Saturday, February .pmNew Wales flanker Jac Morgan admits playing at Twickenham next week would be special given the historic rugby rivalry between England and Wales.Morgan won his first cap on Saturday as reigning Six Nations champions Wales bounced back from a Dublin drubbing against Ireland to beat Scotland - in Cardf.The Welsh-speaking Ospreys openside says he was so nervous before kick-off that he almost forgot the words of the national anthem ‘Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau’.“It’s always a dream to play for your country from a young age,” said the -year-old.“Growing up England is one of the biggest games with the rivalry between the two countries over the years.“Everybody knows how big the game is with the history between the two sides.\"Morgan produced an impressive debut display last weekend, as Wales revived their Six Nations title hopes before heading to Twickenham next Saturday.Courtney Lawes has resumed full training in time to reinforce the middle phase of England’s Guinness Six Nations title push.Lawes was unable to play in the opening two rounds of the tournament because of concussion but has now completed histo play protocols and comes into contention to face Wales next Saturday..removeDefence coach, Anthony Seibold, said: \"Courtney trained fully today , which is obviously really good news for himself and England. He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The comments were made as the UFU launched its annual schools’ competition. Open to all playgroups, nursery, primary, and special schools, this year’s theme relates to the UFU’s food and farming education resource “Dig in!”, which encourages pupils to learn more about food, farming, and the countryside. UFU deputy president, David Brown said, “This year’s schools competition theme ‘Dig in! to food, farming and the environment’ provides an opportunity for teachers to start the discussion in the classroom about the importance of food and farming in NI, allowing pupils to learn more about how farmers work hard to produce the delicious, high-quality produce on our tables, and their contribution to shaping our landscape in NI, which everyone enjoys. “Climate change has been the front runner in NI this year and our farmers play an essential role in combating the global issue, as they are a key part of the solution. The schools competition helps pupils to enhance their understanding of how farmers create dferent environments in NI which support our economy, rural communities, tourism and recreation.” Mr Brown says every year the competition judges are impressed by the number, standard and creativity of entries for the schools’ competition. “We would encourage all nursery, playgroups, primary and special schools to participate in what is a very worthwhile competition. It’s a great opportunity to express their creativity while learning about one of the most important sectors in NI as they will discover the importance of local food production,” he said. The UFU is pleased to have competition sponsor Asda on board for another year with a range of prizes available for the lucky winners. Joe McDonald, Asda NI corporate affairs manager said, “Asda is a proud sponsor of the school’s competition. It is great to see competition entries grow year upon year, especially with the introduction of a dferentiating foundation category last year - the standard is superb. It is vital to create an awareness of where our produce comes from, and this competition is a great opportunity to do so - educating children on the ‘farm to fork’ story.” Now in its eleventh year, BOIOFW is the perfect partner for the schools’ competition. As part of the prize, the winner of each category receives free transport for their class to the nearest participating BOIOFW farm, and all competition entries will be on display throughout the weekend. Mr Brown says schools don’t need to be competition winners in order to visit real, working farms. “This free event showcases NI’s world-class ‘farm to fork’ journey and reconnects consumers with our farmers, the primary food producers.The weekend underlines the importance of supporting local producers to benefit the rural community and wider economy in NI. BOIOFW is taking place on Saturday  and Sunday  June, and I would certainly encourage all schools to consider organising a trip to a local participating farm on the schools’ day, Friday  June,” said the UFU deputy president.
