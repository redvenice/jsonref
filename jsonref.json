The stunning venue has attracted a list guests like Jack Nicholson and Michael DouglasAckergill Tower is believed to date from 1475 and over its 500-year history it was often besieged during feuds between Scottish clans.It was extended in the mid-19th century by Scottish architect David Bryce and was restored in the 1980s to its former grandeur.   Businessman Mike Clare, who founded bed retailer Dreams, bought and converted it in 2009 but he is now selling the impressive property.The property currently operates as a country house hotel but has also been an exclusive wedding, party and conference venue in the past.The five-storey tower is steeped in history but has had 21st century luxuries added and has 32 bedrooms, 31 bathrooms and ten reception rooms including the impressive wood-panelled Great Hall.There is plenty of additional accommodation in the 30 acres of grounds, including the converted stables which sleep ten people and Europe\u0027s largest treehouse, which sleeps two.The treehouse is in a 150-year-old Sycamore tree and has a 7ft round bed and a large circular bath, as well as 360-degree views of the surrounding woodland and a \u0027twilight ceiling\u0027 so guests can gaze up at the stars through the tree\u0027s branches.          Private parties and weddings have been held in the wood panelled dining room. The stunning property is near John O\u0027Groats in Caithness, the most northerly point in Scotland          The tower, complete with a huge tree house and 32 rooms, guest houses and seaside cottages is near John O\u0027Groats in Caithness          The tower has classic, executive and deluxe rooms which guests have been enjoying for decades. The castle itself was built 600 years ago           The striking 15th century Scottish castle stands on the shoreline at Sinclair Bay on the northernmost tip of ScotlandThere is also the Smugglers Inn pub, a beautiful Victorian walled garden, a Bothy and a boathouse.It also has a lease of shooting and fishing rights over a neighbouring 3,000 acres.Michael Jones from Knight Frank said: \u0027It\u0027s a totally unique property, the tower is spectacular in itself and the location is also spectacular right on the sea.\u0027It\u0027s currently running as a hotel but for some wealthy people it would be a great place to have a private residence as well - you could certainly do a fair bit of entertaining.\u0027You could use the main castle as your home and use the other properties on the site as guest accommodation when you need it or as holiday rentals.          The tower has attracted some world famous guests including entrepreneur Richard Bransom, Jack Nicholson and Michael Douglas          A treehouse has been built around a 150 year old sycamore tree in the grounds of the luxury tower. The treehouse features a large circular bath, 7ft round bed and use of a microwave and fridge          Fine dining and events have been held at the castle for decades. Weddings and functions are also held at the £3.9m venue            The Ackergill Tower Estate has its own pub called the ‘Smugglers Inn\u0027 which features a log fire and a fully stocked bar for guests to relax in \u0027There\u0027s a whole variety of possible uses and we\u0027ve had a real mix of interest from the commercial sector and private owners.\u0027It looks a long way north, it is at the top of Scotland but there\u0027s an airport nearby and helicopters can land at the castle itself.\u0027It\u0027s got stunning views across the water and it\u0027s a spectacular position on the clifftop.\u0027This is a very rare opportunity. There are one or two Scottish castles that come on the market every year but something in this condition, of this magnitude and location is pretty much a one-off.\u0027I think the last time there were was a property of this calibre on the market was when this was sold ten years ago.\u0027          There is room for ten in the tastefully designed \u0027Smiddy\u0027 with mezzanine level combines traditional architecture with modern equestrian style décor          Ackergill Tower says: \u0027All bedrooms have their own bespoke design and unique character with period details, sumptuous furnishings and all the modern luxuries you need to make the most of your Highland escape\u0027          The tower has numerous bedrooms and self-contained cottages for guests to say in.

The Stables \u0027smiddy\u0027 is a four bedroom Scottish luxury holiday cottage sleeping up to ten people          The lavish tower and surrounding grounds are going on sale for £3.9million. The tower itself has a whopping 32 rooms, but it also has its own pub, ceilidh hall and the impressive treehouse is just one of six self-contained holiday cottages"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/14/4E05618300000578-0-It_didn_t_go_too_well_for_one_man_in_Clapham_Junction_London_who-a-10_1531055187100.jpg","title":"England football heroes enjoy earned day families","story":"Share this articleShare this article   And the Leicester defender joined in the fun on Sunday, tweeting a caption alongside the picture: \u0027Can you ask the neighbours to put the bins out on Monday?

Then the Prime Minister swept in wearing a purple dress trimmed in green. ‘The colour of the suffragettes,’ observed one minister who thought it ‘very significant’ in the 100th anniversary of the first women securing the vote. The topic for discussion was a 120-page document on the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) which most had received only the afternoon before. Questions went back and forth rapidly.Someone asked for clarification of some of the figures and Chancellor Philip Hammond answered. Ten minutes later he was still talking, at which point he was cut off by the PM who chided that it wasn’t the time for speeches.As the temperature steadily rose – there is no air conditioning at Chequers, the weekend retreat of every prime minister since the end of the First World War – most people took off their jackets.Even Britain’s bearded ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow, in his trademark three piece suit, stripped down to his waistcoat.Brexiteers blast \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 Gove for backing May\u0027s...Furious Brexiteer Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence in...Share this articleThen Mrs May asked Julian Smith, the Chief Whip, to speak.‘Oh God,’ said Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary. Quick as a flash, the PM retorted: ‘He’ll like that as an introduction.’ Smith’s assessment was crucial to May’s subsequent victory, because he bluntly warned that without the FCA compromise the Government would certainly lose a Commons vote on July 16 and be forced to stay in the Customs Union. His remarks had a sobering effect. They broke for a buffet lunch, on the sun-drenched patio, of barbecue chicken thighs with a selection of salads made using produce from the Chequers estate. For dessert there were scones and cream and sticky tea loaf.Boris Johnson, a Cabinet heavyweight in more ways than one, was seen prodding the loaf with a fork but resisted taking a bite.At 2pm, they reassembled in the Grand Parlour as the thermometer on the wall hit 27.3C. Windows were thrown open and the Chequers team ferried in chilled Diet Coke and elderflower cordial.For those who needed more of a sugar rush, a bag of Haribo sweets also went round, with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt photographed ing in, although nothing passed his lips apparently. ‘He’s thinking about his public image all the time,’ observed one source drily.The Prime Minister then spoke for six minutes looking down only occasionally at her notes.‘There was a touch of Elizabeth I about her. Haughty, almost regal, she was confident and assured,’ one minister said admiringly.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy PM, went next. A former Europe minister, arch Remainer, and fully paid-up cheerleader for May, he banged the drum for the FCA. No surprise there.    The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove (pictured), who said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work’All eyes, however, were on David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, whom May then called to speak. It was a pivotal moment. Davis had little to do with the FCA, which was drawn up by civil servants who now appear to be leading the negotiations. He made clear he disagreed with the plan and warned the EU would come back for ‘even more concessions’. But it was clear that he would accept the majority view.One senior source said: ‘He is a realist who knows we are leaving the EU albeit not exactly on the terms he wanted, and he also relishes his Cabinet role.’ Boris Johnson appeared surprised to be called next. In a six-minute ‘rant’ or ‘whinge’, depending who you spoke to, he despaired that the customs plan had ‘emerged zombie-like from the coffin’.The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary. Stressing that the FCA was not his preferred option and arguing they must make more plans for ‘no deal’, he said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work.’The words had the desired effect. ‘It changed everything,’ said another source.

Any idea what I’m doing wrong or are they just selling before I have change to buy?”Richard Boggis posted: “Same here. I almost got one lunchtime but I had the problem selecting collection now it just says something went wrong even if I try to select medium availability for Tuesday game.“Don’t know if I’m wasting my time. Any advice much needed.”          Manager Gareth Southgate roared with jubilation as the referee signalled full time   England have booked their place in the semi-finals of the Russia World Cup after defeating Sweden 2-0 in SamaraAlthough flights and match tickets will be expensive, fans can still grab themselves a bargain when it comes to accommodation.Single rooms within a few miles of the city centre are available online for less than £20 a night via Trivago with more central options starting at £60 - but some four and five-star Moscow rooms will cost at least £1,000-per night.Match tickets are limited via the FIFA website but are being offered on resale sites.This is because Russians were offered thousands of tickets are face value before the tournament, which they can then sell on.Fans from countries like Germany, Brazil, and Spain, who expected to be in the semi-finals instead of England, are also selling off the tickets they no longer need.    If England fans get a ticket they\u0027ll need to apply for a visa by tomorrow to ensure they can enter Russia in time for the game.  Fans wishing to travel this week will either need a valid visa or a FIFA FAN ID, which acts as a visa for people visiting Russia for the World Cup.Although it\u0027s possible to fast-track a visa application, the shortest time-frame offered online is 72 hours, making it impossible to obtain one before you\u0027d need to fly to Moscow for the Croatia game.You can, however, apply for a FAN ID here, providing you have a ticket number for an upcoming game or one that has already been played.Applications take about 10 minutes and should be approved within 24 hours. You can then either print your FAN ID or collect it in Russia. The document - which includes a unique number and passport-style photo - is also used to enter stadiums and to book free rail travel.              For the very richest people can charter a private jet for at least £22,000 for a one-way tripSaturday’s 2-0 victory over Sweden secured a place in the semi-final in the Russian capital on Wednesday evening.It also guarantees England will play twice more, in that game and hopefully in Sunday afternoon’s final against either France or Belgium, which will also be in Moscow.But even defeat to Croatia in Wednesday’s semi-final would mean playing in the third-place match, which takes place in St Petersburg on Saturday afternoon.  BBC football pundits in Moscow joined in the raucous celebrations. After analysing the match – which was played 500 miles away in Samara– from their studio in Red Square, Alan Shearer, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker posted videos of themselves belting out songs in a bar.Egged on by former Germany star Jurgen Klinsmann, Shearer sang Lionel Richie’s All Night Long, using breadsticks as a pretend microphone. Earlier he and his colleagues sang along to the Three Lions anthem. Shearer told fans: ‘It’s coming home. A little bit of a party going on.’The Football Supporters’ Federation predicts that more than 10,000 fans will make the pilgrimage to Moscow for Wednesday’s clash, the first time in 28 years that England have reached a World Cup semi-final. However, many will face problems finding flights, accommodation and – more importantly – match tickets.Some England fans already have tickets for Wednesday’s game as the FA sold an allocation of 2,180 back in January. Thousands more were sold to England fans through world governing body Fifa. A Fifa spokesman said yesterday: ‘Tickets which become available for the remaining matches are sold via fifa.com and it is a dynamic process. It depends on the numbers which are resold by fans who have bought them but no longer want to attend matches.‘We advise fans of availability through a traffic light system of colours. For France v Belgium there were still some available. Those not being used come up for sale automatically.‘There were some in the red zone for England v Croatia meaning they were available but they are now in grey which means they have been purchased. You must have a fan ID issued by the Russian authorities to get a visa to get into Russia.’ Supporters’ chiefs predict the rush for Wednesday’s semi-final will match the last-minute dash to Italy for the 1990 World Cup semi-final against West Germany in Turin. That match ended in tears for England – and star midfielder Paul Gascoigne – with defeat in penalty shoot-out.The only other occasion England reached the semi-finals was on home soil in 1966, on the way to lifting the trophy.England manager Gareth Southgate said yesterday that winning the World Cup in Russia would be an even bigger triumph.‘We’ve talked, touched briefly, on the team which won. How they’re still held and revered,’ he said. ‘Perhaps in the modern era that would be even crazier, social media and everything else, the global thing is so much bigger.’ Captain Harry Kane said: ‘We are not finished yet. We want to go all the way.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/12/4E0DC35A00000578-0-image-a-2_1531134271903.jpg","title":"Student 100 online job applications gets job days handing CV commuters","story":"    The accounting and finance student woke up at 5.30am, printed off 35 copies of his CV and made his way to Liverpool Street station, London, for 7:30am After just four hours of standing on the street he only had four CVs left and the interview offers started rolling in.The next day he was called into interview, accepted a job offer and is now set to start his new role as a transaction executive for a marketing firm on Wednesday.The 21-year-old said: \u0027My gamble paid off.

The stunning venue has attracted a list guests like Jack Nicholson and Michael DouglasAckergill Tower is believed to date from 1475 and over its 500-year history it was often besieged during feuds between Scottish clans.It was extended in the mid-19th century by Scottish architect David Bryce and was restored in the 1980s to its former grandeur.   Businessman Mike Clare, who founded bed retailer Dreams, bought and converted it in 2009 but he is now selling the impressive property.The property currently operates as a country house hotel but has also been an exclusive wedding, party and conference venue in the past.The five-storey tower is steeped in history but has had 21st century luxuries added and has 32 bedrooms, 31 bathrooms and ten reception rooms including the impressive wood-panelled Great Hall.There is plenty of additional accommodation in the 30 acres of grounds, including the converted stables which sleep ten people and Europe\u0027s largest treehouse, which sleeps two.The treehouse is in a 150-year-old Sycamore tree and has a 7ft round bed and a large circular bath, as well as 360-degree views of the surrounding woodland and a \u0027twilight ceiling\u0027 so guests can gaze up at the stars through the tree\u0027s branches.          Private parties and weddings have been held in the wood panelled dining room.

The castle itself was built 600 years ago           The striking 15th century Scottish castle stands on the shoreline at Sinclair Bay on the northernmost tip of ScotlandThere is also the Smugglers Inn pub, a beautiful Victorian walled garden, a Bothy and a boathouse.It also has a lease of shooting and fishing rights over a neighbouring 3,000 acres.Michael Jones from Knight Frank said: \u0027It\u0027s a totally unique property, the tower is spectacular in itself and the location is also spectacular right on the sea.\u0027It\u0027s currently running as a hotel but for some wealthy people it would be a great place to have a private residence as well - you could certainly do a fair bit of entertaining.\u0027You could use the main castle as your home and use the other properties on the site as guest accommodation when you need it or as holiday rentals.          The tower has attracted some world famous guests including entrepreneur Richard Bransom, Jack Nicholson and Michael Douglas          A treehouse has been built around a 150 year old sycamore tree in the grounds of the luxury tower. The treehouse features a large circular bath, 7ft round bed and use of a microwave and fridge          Fine dining and events have been held at the castle for decades.

Then the Prime Minister swept in wearing a purple dress trimmed in green. ‘The colour of the suffragettes,’ observed one minister who thought it ‘very significant’ in the 100th anniversary of the first women securing the vote. The topic for discussion was a 120-page document on the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) which most had received only the afternoon before. Questions went back and forth rapidly.Someone asked for clarification of some of the figures and Chancellor Philip Hammond answered. Ten minutes later he was still talking, at which point he was cut off by the PM who chided that it wasn’t the time for speeches.As the temperature steadily rose – there is no air conditioning at Chequers, the weekend retreat of every prime minister since the end of the First World War – most people took off their jackets.Even Britain’s bearded ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow, in his trademark three piece suit, stripped down to his waistcoat.Brexiteers blast \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 Gove for backing May\u0027s...Furious Brexiteer Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence in...Share this articleThen Mrs May asked Julian Smith, the Chief Whip, to speak.‘Oh God,’ said Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary. Quick as a flash, the PM retorted: ‘He’ll like that as an introduction.’ Smith’s assessment was crucial to May’s subsequent victory, because he bluntly warned that without the FCA compromise the Government would certainly lose a Commons vote on July 16 and be forced to stay in the Customs Union. His remarks had a sobering effect. They broke for a buffet lunch, on the sun-drenched patio, of barbecue chicken thighs with a selection of salads made using produce from the Chequers estate. For dessert there were scones and cream and sticky tea loaf.Boris Johnson, a Cabinet heavyweight in more ways than one, was seen prodding the loaf with a fork but resisted taking a bite.At 2pm, they reassembled in the Grand Parlour as the thermometer on the wall hit 27.3C. Windows were thrown open and the Chequers team ferried in chilled Diet Coke and elderflower cordial.For those who needed more of a sugar rush, a bag of Haribo sweets also went round, with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt photographed ing in, although nothing passed his lips apparently. ‘He’s thinking about his public image all the time,’ observed one source drily.The Prime Minister then spoke for six minutes looking down only occasionally at her notes.‘There was a touch of Elizabeth I about her. Haughty, almost regal, she was confident and assured,’ one minister said admiringly.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy PM, went next. A former Europe minister, arch Remainer, and fully paid-up cheerleader for May, he banged the drum for the FCA. No surprise there.    The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove (pictured), who said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work’All eyes, however, were on David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, whom May then called to speak. It was a pivotal moment. Davis had little to do with the FCA, which was drawn up by civil servants who now appear to be leading the negotiations. He made clear he disagreed with the plan and warned the EU would come back for ‘even more concessions’. But it was clear that he would accept the majority view.One senior source said: ‘He is a realist who knows we are leaving the EU albeit not exactly on the terms he wanted, and he also relishes his Cabinet role.’ Boris Johnson appeared surprised to be called next. In a six-minute ‘rant’ or ‘whinge’, depending who you spoke to, he despaired that the customs plan had ‘emerged zombie-like from the coffin’.The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary. Stressing that the FCA was not his preferred option and arguing they must make more plans for ‘no deal’, he said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work.’The words had the desired effect. ‘It changed everything,’ said another source. There was a rumble of supportive noises and suddenly the little bubble of rebellion had burst – although critics were determined to have their say. Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom was ‘vehemently’ against the policy but ended by saying: ‘I will support you, Prime Minister.’Another notable contribution came from Penny Mordaunt, the International Aid Secretary, who made clear her own misgivings, while Esther McVey, the Work and Pensions Secretary and close ally of backbench Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith, also trashed the plan.After all 29 ministers had spoken, with seven making clear their opposition, the PM addressed them again saying there was a majority for the policy and demanding a return to Cabinet collective responsibility.‘We have seen what happens when a team is united and gets behind their leader,’ she said – a clear reference to the England footballers’ World Cup success.With the discussions over, they toasted a rare outbreak of Cabinet unity with Pol Roger champagne, the favourite of Churchill. In a jocular speech Boris Johnson proposed a toast to the Prime Minister, who interrupted to say: ‘If only people could see how united we are now.’ But can it last? "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/04/4DFB7DFA00000578-5931823-Cabinet_ministers_gathered_at_Chequers_on_Friday_pictured_but_pl-a-3_1531106663014.jpg","title":"Weakest Thai soccer players extracted caves Adelaide doctor said ready move","story":"    Dr Richard Harris is an anesthetist from Adelaide who went into the cave at the request of Thai authoritiesAn Australian doctor convinced Thai officials to change their rescue plans and first get some of the weakest boys out of the cave where they were trapped, it can be revealed. Cave er and anaesthetist Dr Richard Harris, from Adelaide, ed with the rescue team on Sunday afternoon to check on the 12 boys and their coach.The initial strategy was to extract the strongest boys first because they would have more chance of making it to safety while the others could stay back and build up strength.But that was revised after Dr Harris\u0027 health assessment found some of the weaker boys may not survive if they were left behind, according to Thai media.Four of the 12 trapped boys were brought to safety on Sunday evening. Operations to bring out the other eight and their coach will start this afternoon as ers place fresh oxygen tanks along the exit route. Dr Harris, who was requested by British ers leading the operation, is working alongside the Thai Navy and 18 other Australians in the rescue efforts.The 53-year-old has 30 years of ing experience and has worked on retrieving bodies from caves.He famously found the body of stunt er Agnes Milowka who ran out of air in the Tank Cave near Tantanoola in the south east of South Australia in 2011, The Advertiser reported.David Strike, a e event organiser who has known Dr Harris for more than a decade told Fairfax: \u0027He\u0027s been ing for over 30 years, and readily embraced advances in ing technology to better help him explore and photograph caves in Australia and overseas.\u0027\u0027In the past few years, he\u0027s been involved in cave-ing explorations in Australia, China, Christmas Island and New Zealand. He has an active interest in ing safety and accident investigation.\u0027Quite apart from his own cave exploration experiences, as an anaesthetist and a medical professional who is also involved in retrieval medicine, he has always struck me as a person who is capable of calmly assessing any situation and then acting appropriately.\u0027 The \u0027extremely dangerous\u0027 operation to free the boys, who have been trapped in the cave for 15 days, began on Sunday morning when rescuers decided to act before more monsoon rains flood the caves.            Dr Harris has 30 years of ing experience and will work with the Royal Thai Navy during the operation.

Beyond advances in the manufacture of clothing, the whims of fashion, and the occasional fad – who remembers Levi’s twisted seam? – cotton has remained cotton, and polyester is still polyester.But an award-winning Italian design duo is trying to realise the potential of smart technology in clothing to improve lives.Emanuela Corti and Ivan Parati, who met while studying at the Polytechnic University of Milan, have developed Sensewear, a collection of smart clothing and accessories for people who suffer from SPD. Also known as sensory integration difficulties, SPD can affect the way people, particularly those on the autism spectrum, process everyday stimuli, from light to touch.Their innovative work won Corti and Parati an AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You Award as part of the AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme, which aims to identify inidual champions, innovators and organisations that are creating exciting and pioneering health tech. In addition to winning awards, Corti and Parati’s work has also gained the attention of research academics and manufacturers in Italy.“If it is not treated effectively, it can result in clumsiness, behavioural problems, anxiety, depression or failure at school,” says Corti, a product designer specialising in textiles and furniture. She says hypersensitivity is often part of SPD, which can result in an enhanced sensitivity to sounds, smells and physical contact. “The textures, stitches and labels in regular clothes can cause unsustainably painful reactions,” she says. Left untreated, these symptoms can be disabling, leading to social isolation, anxiety and low self-esteem.The couple, who now have a young daughter, started with comparatively low-tech solutions, looking at the potential for 3D knitting processes, for example, to reduce potential rubbing points. They also looked at ways to redesign – or to build into clothing – some of the specialised toys and medical accessories already available. “Our focus was on incorporating those therapies into everyday objects that would not stigmatise the user as a disabled person,” Corti says. “We wanted to create invisible magic.”But the designers also wanted to think big. What if the elements of a wardrobe could talk to each other? For this, Corti and Parati looked at some of the smart clothing that is starting to become available, typically now targeted at the fitness market, such as Nadi X smart yoga leggings, which pulse on different muscles to encourage correct positions, and the sports vests that measures an athlete’s heart rate and position.“Our smart T-shirt will collect vital data – such as heart rate, breath frequency and movement – which is processed by an app to indicate the stress level of the wearer. It can then trigger the functionalities of other garments in the collection,” says Corti.One such garment is an inflatable pullover, capable of delivering a targeted “hug” to a wearer in need. “Deep pressure or deep touch pressure therapy (DTP) is a firm, tactile sensory input that can consist of firm hugs, stroking or cuddling,” says Corti. “It can have a calming effect on children and adults. Many people affected by autism refuse physical contact with others, but might be happy with a mechanical surrogate.” Other Sensewear innovations include Biteme, a biteable silicon necklace that measures pressure, and an aromatic scarf that can emit familiar, comforting scents.“This is a visionary concept that materialises ideas initially described by Mary Temple Grandin,” says Cesare Furlanello, head of the research group at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, and an expert in the way machine learning can be applied to biomedical and environmental data. Grandin, now 70, is a US professor of animal science and campaigner for autism awareness. She specialises in the emotional as well as physical welfare of livestock, and also invented a mechanical “hug box” for humans, after noticing how confined cattle calmed down before being inoculated.“As a child, I craved to feel the comfort of being held, but I would pull away when people hugged me,” Grandin wrote in 1992 in a description of the machine, a sort of pneumatic cocoon with pressurised padding that allowed her to control her own hugging. She suffered panic attacks throughout her teenage years before building the device in early adulthood. “Gradually, my tolerance of being held by the squeeze machine grew. Knowing that I could initiate the pressure, and stop it if the stimulation became too intense, helped me to reduce the oversensitivity of my nervous system.”Medical vests that replicate this mechanism have already been developed, but Corti’s priority is to make smart clothing that looks cool. “If you have a difficulty you don’t want people to stare at you, right? You don’t want to feel different,” she says. This summer, a team including Furlanello will introduce some of the Sensewear range to children with autism, to explore its potential to make their lives easier. “Patients are very often reluctant to ‘wear’ cumbersome and ugly scientific devices,” says Furlanello, “but we expect Sensewear smart clothes will be much more acceptable, which will help researchers to collect data and expand the context of the study.”Corti now hopes that the ideas behind Sensewear’s smart clothing might one day find broader applications. “We would like to expand our philosophy to furniture, interior design and objects,” she says. “We think that everyone faces a certain degree of discomfort, so we are also thinking about people who just live in a hectic urban environment and might want protection from overwhelming sensations or stresses.”Imagine having a slow, firm hug, administered automatically and invisibly, on a delayed, crowded commuter train. There might well be a market for that.We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream. Innovations in health technology are transforming the way we care for our minds and bodies.

This year sees the annual AXA Health Tech \u0026amp You programme return, with new categories including the Women Entrepreneurs in Health Tech award, created to encourage and support women pioneering some of the most innovative health technology.It’s certainly not that women aren’t enthused by the world of technology. We’ve spoken to three finalists, budding health tech entrepreneurs – who happen to also be women – to find out about their experiences within the industry.BrightSign develops communication tech for children and sign language users. Its founder, Hadeel Ayoub, travelled with a team to South Korea during her PhD studies to take part in a global hackathon, entering a smart glove that translates sign language into text or speech. They won the competition, which led her to develop the technology further and create BrightSign.“The tech arena in general is definitely male dominated. In digital health specifically, when I take part in trade shows or give a talk in a conference, most often I am the only woman on the programme. I am not necessarily treated differently, but the look of surprise on people’s faces when I am walking to the podium, into a meeting or presenting my technology cannot be overlooked. My name doesn’t always give me away as a woman, so it has happened to me several times that I am mistaken for the assistant while ‘Mr Hadeel’ is coming shortly.”Although Ayoub is encouraged by the progress the industry is making when it comes to being more inclusive to women, she sometimes feels she can be treated like a box to tick.“I feel I have been invited to events so they can even out the numbers and check the inclusivity and ersity boxes. That’s a shame, because I would rather be included for my work, not my gender.“I have to say that in the past couple of months, I have been very happy to see other female names presenting, and CEOs no less. There are a few women in tech in London. We have joined together and meet up regularly to share our challenges and support each other.”Hsin-Hua Yu, known as Sheana, was inspired by her own experiences with scoliosis (curvature of the spine) to create Aergo, a low-cost, inconspicuous postural support system. Sheana, who graduated with a double master’s in global innovation design at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, was motivated by a research visit where she met with young people who used wheelchairs but struggled to sit comfortably and maintain a healthy posture.“Students and carers complained about the social stigma caused by not being able to sit upright, which led to people excluding them from conversations or activities. This motivated me to create a solution that helps children to break free from the need for constant assistance and build their self-confidence,” she says.Despite her complex and life-changing work, Sheana feels she faces something of an uphill struggle to be taken seriously.“As a female founder, I feel I have more to prove in front of colleagues, investors and business partners. I find the medical industry is particularly male-dominated and this can sometimes be quite intimidating. I’ve learned that by being clear, firm and professional, people begin to look past my gender and see me for my abilities.”Sheana would like to see a more “inclusive” health tech industry in future.“I’d like to see health tech designing solutions for all members of society. A lot of health tech today focuses on the medical condition and not the person. This often leads to a solution that can contribute to prejudice and social stigma. I believe in creating tech that is accessible to a wider range of users because it has the power to transform lives, remove social barriers, and change perceptions of disability within our culture.” Before creating iBreve, Wahl was working at Google’s legal department in Dublin and Boston. While travelling with her co-creator in Rishikesh, India – known as the yoga capital of the world – the pair saw an opportunity to combine breathing techniques from eastern culture with the western world and its modern stresses.“The growing trend of mindfulness and the increasing popularity of wearables reinforced our endeavour,” says Wahl. “We decided to focus initially on women’s health and wellbeing. So we designed a beautiful and discreet wearable that attaches to the bra and helps to improve stress resilience by analysing breathing patterns with machine learning.”Wahl wants to inspire more women and more ersity as a whole in the tech world.“Inspiring more girls and women to join the tech world is going to contribute to this ersity and benefits society with better answers to the current big challenges we face. My time at Google and at iBreve showed me that working together with a erse team from different backgrounds and with different experiences is productive, insightful and fun.”She would encourage women wanting to break into the health tech industry – and the tech industry as a whole – to listen to their instincts and follow what comes naturally.“The most important thing is to believe in yourself and do what you are passionate about. Trust your instincts and share your ideas and passion with others.”We’re here to promote the people who dare to dream.

But many now fear the city’s regeneration threatens their traditional way of lifeby Karin Goodwin and Chris LeslieFamilies living in Glasgow’s carnival yards can trace their heritage back hundreds of years. But many now fear the city’s regeneration threatens their traditional way of lifeby Karin Goodwin and Chris LeslieOn Water Row, sandwiched between Glasgow’s former shipyards and the dark waters of the River Clyde, it would be easy to miss the showpeople’s yards.Look closely and you’ll see a carved dancing bear, chained to an old telegraph pole, or behind high metal railings the folded-up fairground rides waiting repair – tantalising snatches of “the shows”.But now some are saying the pace of 21st-century development is pushing them out of the city.Their concerns are focused around Govan, where regeneration plans are threatening two large extended families. Glasgow city council claims that proposals for Water Row will bring new housing, jobs, businesses and leisure facilities to the community, which undoubtedly needs investment.To some, however, the proposals are hard to stomach as they will mean eviction. Teresa Johnstone was born on Water Row into the Wilmot family, a well-known family of Scottish showpeople. She married and raised her sons here, and has lived on this neat and tidy site for 29 years, paying rent and council tax. Now a £17m development is planned for the site of her home, so she will be relocated.The council says it has been “in regular dialogue with the representatives of the families, offering the full support of the council to move to alternative and fully serviced sites in the local area and beyond”. Johnstone, however, says her family only found out days before the public announcement. It took months to get anything in writing, and though a potential relocation site has now been suggested, there is still no firm solution on the table.Jimmy Stringfellow, who lives in the next yard along with his wife, Diane, their son and grandchildren, is also on tenterhooks. He is currently challenging an eviction notice he was served this year.“It feels like a game of ping pong,” he says of the communication with officials over relocation. “And I can tell you it doesn’t half pong. We’re an endangered species but there is more protection for butterflies and crocodiles than there is for us. It feels like they don’t want us. We are being shoved out of the way and into corners.”Showpeople offer an important service, she says, providing entertainment at galas, fair holidays, fetes, festivals and firework displays, and that should be recognised.“We are governed by the Showman’s Guild – we can’t just pull into derelict land, we’d get fined,” says Johnstone. “We pay council tax, we are regulated. And yet we are getting treated like second-class citizens. We should have equality.”Follow the winding River Clyde a few miles east and you’ll get to Cuningar Loop, a gated site where rows of chalets with neat front gardens house around 100 people. Yard owner Norman Thomas claims the Govan situation has left people rattled. Thomas bought this land, next to a filled-in rubbish dump, 28 years ago. He worries that he doesn’t ultimately control it – a few years ago, South Lanarkshire council tried to move these showpeople to a new site. The plan was only abandoned due to rising costs. Fresh in Thomas’ memory, too, is a relocation programme prior to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, when 22 yards in South Dalmarnock home to some 600 people, were earmarked for redevelopment.After much consultation only 75 chalets were affected. The regeneration partnership, known as Clyde Gateway, says it is proud of the way it managed the programme to “ensure that every family or business affected would have options” for being rehoused. It developed two new yards and invested in improvements to existing sites. Next to the site, Clyde Gateway has developed a popular woodland park, and recently the British Geological Survey put in planning permission for a geo-thermal research site. Both organisations are at pains to explain how carefully they have consulted with the community, but trust isn’t won easily here.“We were brought up to be proud that we are from an entrepreneurial background that goes back for generations, and that we are all very community focused,” says Thomas’ son Royce, who returned here with his husband after studying at university in London. “But there is stigma. So when we hear about what’s happening in Govan yes, we do worry.”The community feels its entire way of life is under threat. In a wagon at the bottom of the site, Preston Irvin is painstakingly airbrushing a children’s ride. He loves this life, but says it is far from easy. There are ever-stricter licensing regulations and soaring costs fairs are shorter and competition for punters fierce. In the winter, he takes on other jobs to help him survive until the season starts again.“Years ago it was different,” he says. “I don’t want to give up this way of life but it is getting harder and harder.” He, too, fears for the future. “You’re think you’re settled. Maybe that could change. And not everyone is happy to have a fairground way of life on their doorstep.”A short drive away in Parkhead lives illustrator and researcher Mitch Miller. There are no development plans for his small, traditional site either, but Miller knows it is a precarious way of life. “What’s happening in Govan can happen anywhere.”He moved back several years ago after living in a Glasgow tenement, where he missed the community. His father, who still runs hook-a-duck stalls and other sideshows, likes to tell stories of acrobat ancestors, boxing grandmothers and trick riding aunties.Miller is one of a small group of campaigners who have written to local politicians with their concerns about the lack of due process in Govan. He hopes a solution will help others fare better in the face of future development.“We are not asking for the moon but for the procedure to be followed,” he says. “Those families have a claim to be there. They put a community in when there was nothing else.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f0a520e5b316814abf7e1cf4a6a35cfb3b64228/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496da1b398abed95595a6c599c6276c","title":"brexit trade eu theresa may david davis","story":"No sooner does Theresa May win her cabinet critics over to her Brexit compromise than David Davis rains on her parade. Her chief Brexit negotiator has had enough. His resignation letter suggests a long-disaffected colleague, sidelined from negotiations and fed up with being the butt of feuds. Quite what he wanted from his job that was remotely achievable remains obscure. Now he is yesterday’s man.Brexit steams ahead. The referendum outcome is to be honoured. Basic parliamentary sovereignty over dealings with the EU will be restored. But the modalities of Britain’s trade with its European neighbours demand workable arrangements. From the start, these have meant some sort of “friction-free” customs union and ease of movement for millions across the English Channel and the Irish border. Despite foolish pledges by May that Brexit would not mean these things, it always did mean them and it will. Few Britons ever indicated that they wanted a true “breakaway” from Europe, just from the EU. Since last week, that distinction has acquired meaning.May now has a battle on three fronts. She has her cabinet in overwhelming and explicit support, including known opponents and rivals such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. They live to fight a later day. It is hard to believe there will be any support for a leadership challenge – despite media glee at the prospect – and if there is one, May would surely win. Loyalty to the leader in a moment of crisis is now her strongest card.The next battle is to ensure support for “soft” Brexit in parliament. May can probably rely on the minority parties for her compromise, but Labour remains mealy-mouthed. Jeremy Corbyn has finally supported a customs union, but his Brexit colleague, Keir Starmer, has declared that May’s version will not work. He should be persuaded otherwise, or at the very least drawn into the final negotiating stage. Brexit must shift from being a partisan issue to being a campaign for common sense. Unity is not all, but it helps.The reason for this is May’s third battle: to strengthen her hand with the EU negotiators in Brussels, who have been left virtually to get on with it by the EU’s ided and distracted council of ministers. It is clear that “Norway plus or minus” is on the table, but it must be tweaked. Britain is not Norway. Much has to be argued at the margins of the customs union and single market.The derision shown by Brexiters towards those responsible for the British economy has been not so much arrogant as illiterate. Relations between states require the give and take of regulation and arbitration. Trade is not the end of sovereignty, but it does mean accepting the need for compromise to maintain access to Britain’s biggest and closest market. Now surely is the moment when Brexit can move on and reality dawn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/945b88697b9afa7e7b9a0599c2d5f9ff751c019a/193_0_3375_2025/master/3375.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=833ef0c4133e1c6845e5e05e2242fb86","title":"labour brexit jacob rees mogg","story":"Brexit is not really a matter of opinion. Of course, some people believe it a good idea: others, including me, think it a disaster. But as David Davis’s resignation today shows, that’s not now the point. It simply is not deliverable.The only way Brexit might have worked without an economic collapse is the Norway model of close integration with the structure of the European customs union and single market without being part of the formal EU institutions.In the end, after much anguish as she tried and failed to identify a workable “hard Brexit”, Theresa May recognised this. Hence her Chequers fudge, which was a decisive move towards Norway, with the clear intention to go further in negotiations. She tried to coax her party into a policy that kept the Brexit label but junked most of the Faragist content. At Chequers she, in effect, agreed alignment with the EU on swaths of economic regulation, accepting elements of jurisdiction by the European court of justice, crossing each and every one of her previous red lines.But it hasn’t worked. As with the poll tax in its dying months, ever more elaborate fudges and “transition” and “interim” proposals can’t bridge a chasm of this size. If she tries to move further towards Norway, she loses her party but if she doesn’t, she loses any possibility of a workable deal with the EU.May is now in the desperate position of Anthony Eden after Suez and James Callaghan in the winter of discontent. She has no policy to govern or unite the country, and her party and government are imploding. Whether it takes days, weeks or months, her government is over – and Brexit too, unless it can be reconstituted under a new prime minister or government.That now is the question facing parliament – and in particular my Labour party, which has a crucial part to play. Jeremy Corbyn needs to make it clear that he will not be a party to any Brexit. Hitherto he has declared opposition to “hard Brexit” but since there now isn’t a workable soft Brexit, the political and economic necessity is for Labour to oppose Brexit entirely.Corbyn hopes for a general election and entry into No\u0026nbsp10. Maybe the government will implode to such a degree that this happens before the key parliamentary votes on Brexit. But if this doesn’t happen quickly – and I doubt that enough Tory MPs would vote for a motion of no confidence to bring it about – then the next best course is a people’s vote.Precisely how and when a people’s vote can command a Commons majority depends upon whether May, or her Tory successor if she falls soon, is able to negotiate anything with Brussels. But since negotiations of some kind are likely to continue for a while, even if they fail, decision time will probably be at the end of the year. A people’s vote – with the choice being between staying in the EU, as against the Tory “bare bones” deal if there is one, or no deal if there isn’t – would then be in the first half of next year. Labour, with Tory pro-Europeans, would lead the campaign to stay in the EU.The original sin of Brexit – the lies, contradictions, half-truths and omissions on which it was built – have come back to haunt the Thatcherite Tories who started all this with Nigel Farage and Ukip.It is simply not possible to achieve the “freedom” from EU economic institutions that Brexiters want without undermining Britain’s economy and security. But anything short of hard Brexit leaves Britain exactly as Jacob Rees-Mogg has described it – “a vassal state”, a colony of France and Germany in key respects, because we are forced to follow their trade and regulatory systems without a seat at the table in devising them.It is not often that I agree with Rees-Mogg. But on the imperative not to become a “vassal state”, I agree entirely. The fact that we would both fiercely oppose such an outcome demonstrates that it is politically non-viable and would not command a parliamentary majority.The only way now to reassert British sovereignty and national interest is to vote to stay in the EU. We tried a different course. It hasn’t worked. It can’t be made to work. It is time to end this national farce and humiliation, and stop playing politics with people’s jobs and livelihoods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/def8ca74ee1b1ce1732bbc2e6e026876606ee376/0_168_5025_3015/master/5025.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d57d2729b598abf187022a1f72c0d1f","title":"one in three fish caught never makes it to the plate un report","story":"Global fish production is at record levels thanks to fish farming, says the UN FAO, but much is wasted and many species are worryingly overfishedOne in three fish caught around the world never makes it to the plate, either being thrown back overboard or rotting before it can be eaten, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.Its biannual report on the state of the world’s fisheries, released on Monday, also shows that total fish production has reached a record high thanks to more fish farming, particularly in China, with over half the fish eaten in the world now coming from aquaculture.Fish are a crucial source of nutrition for billions of people around the globe, but overfishing is rife in some regions, with two-thirds of species overexploited in the Mediterranean and Black Seas and the Southeast Pacific. Previous analyses that include estimates for illegal fishing indicate that wild fish stocks are declining faster than FAO data suggest and that half the world’s oceans are now industrially fished. “Since 1961 the annual global growth in fish consumption has been twice as high as population growth, demonstrating that the fisheries sector is crucial in meeting the FAO’s goal of a world without hunger and malnutrition,” said José Graziano da Silva, FAO director general. Many challenges remain, he said, but recent initiatives to crack down on illegal fishing will mark “a turning point” in favour of long-term conservation.The FAO report sets out the huge scale of global fishing: it employs 60 million people and there are 4.6m fishing vessels on the planet. This huge effort is worrying in many places, the FAO says, with too many boats chasing too few fish. As a result, the number of species being overfished has trebled in the last 40 years. The report also states that climate change will drive fish away from warm tropical waters, where nations are often especially reliant on seafood, towards more temperate regions.Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe, said huge improvements were needed across the fishing industry. “Food waste on a hungry planet is outrageous,” he said. “The fact that one-third of all fish caught goes to waste is a huge cause for concern for global food security.” On overfishing, particularly in the Mediterranean, he said: “We know the situation, we have the solutions: setting fish catch limits to scientific advice and stopping illegal and destructive fishing. All we’re missing is political action.” Gustavsson added: “Aquaculture is far from being the magic bullet, as it is often unsustainable. Using 20m tonnes of fish like mackerel, sardines and anchovies to feed farmed fish instead of people is a blatant waste of food.”Prof Daniel Pauly, at the Sea Around Us research initiative at the University of British Columbia, Canada, has been very critical of previous FAO reports, which he says significantly underestimated the total catch by failing to account for illegal fishing.

In the sprints he was up there with the best. During the warm-up exercises he barely lost the ball. You could see that he takes care of himself and his diet.His name? Thierry Henry, of course. Such details enhance the former Arsenal forward’s status as an idol in the Belgium set-up and help to make him a perfect link between the players and staff.But suddenly there are other links to consider, too. This week Henry has been thrust into the position of trying to help those players defeat the country of his birth, for whom he won 123 caps, not to mention a World Cup and European Championship.Henry’s presence on Belgium’s bench for their semi-final against France on Tuesday has prompted no shortage of comment from Les Bleus. “It’s bizarre,” Didier Deschamps, the coach, told Téléfoot. Olivier Giroud was more forthright. “I would be proud to show Titi that he chose the wrong camp,” he said. The striker believes it will be a “peculiar match” for Henry.What Henry makes of it remains a mystery. Interview requests and demands to get him to a press conference were brushed aside. He prefers to leave the talking to the others. The 40-year-old does not want his massive shadow to take limelight away from those who have a bigger influence on performances.No one in the Belgium camp carries a reputation as substantial as the former Arsenal striker’s. He is the most decorated staff member, with a Champions League and five league titles to add to those honours with France. He was – and still is – worshipped by millions of fans. He presents an image of charm, wit, intelligence and flair.Even in Russia, 20 years after he won the World Cup, you can feel his aura. Journalists covering Belgium are starting to get slightly annoyed by it. At every press conference comes the same question. A Belgian, Dutchman, Frenchman, Spaniard or Englishman begs for the microphone and asks the player about … Belgium’s second assistant‑manager: “How does it feel to be on the pitch with him?” “What does he add to your game?” “Does his experience help you in the race to the final?”Last week there were plenty of sighs among the reporters but now it is even worse. The Thierry Henry game is on. In the buildup to France‑Belgium the Belgium assistant will have most of the spotlights on him: the temporary enemy of France. His reputation, nationality and past drawn as a shadow over him, at a moment when he was enjoying a role in the shade.Henry joined the Belgium squad in 2016, a few weeks after Roberto Martínez had been appointed as manager, and since has given one interview: to Belgium’s public broadcaster, in which he emphasised that he wanted to stay out of the limelight. “I am not the national manager, neither am I the assistant manager,” he said. “I’m the T3, the third coach. From the beginning I have said that everybody had to keep calm. It’s not the Thierry Henry show I’m here to help the manager and the squad. The manager is the one who will do the talking, I will try to make the team better. As a coach you don’t have to mention what you have done as player in the past. And as a coach I haven’t proven anything.”That was something he made clear to the Belgian football federation (KBVB) too, when an agreement was concluded in August 2016 in Monaco. In support of Martínez and his first assistant, the Englishman Graeme Jones, the governing body wanted a coach who had copious experience as a player, had won trophies and could transfer his know-how and winning mentality to this generation of players.It was early in the process of searching out a successor for Marc Wilmots that Ralf Rangnick, now the director of football of RB Leipzig but then one of the three main candidates, mentioned that Henry was interested in joining Belgium.Rangnick said that, if he got the job, Henry should join him as an assistant. Rangnick was not appointed but Martínez welcomed with open arms the suggestion of taking Henry on to his staff. KBVB directors have never hidden that Henry was getting work experience for his coaching badges. He was allowed to keep his well-paid job as a pundit with Sky and his demands were modest – he earns about €2,500 (£2,200) a week and apparently donates his wages to charity. Unlike Martínez, who signed a new two‑year deal before the World Cup, Henry has not accepted an offer to continue. The Belgian FA hopes he will extend, too.When Henry was introduced to the players in their hotel in Zaventem in September 2016, some were amazed to meet him. He was one of their childhood idols. Some, such as Christian Benteke and Michy Batshuayi, had posters of him on the wall. A source in the KBVB said: “You should have seen their faces. Priceless reactions.” Batshuayi, master of social media, immediately posted a picture of Henry and him: “Learning from the best.”Henry acts like a teacher, too. He regularly pulls the attackers aside to talk about their movement and positioning. At one of the first meetings he asked Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and co to show clips and would give his observations. Henry, a perfectionist, does not mince his words. He can be very hard and forthright with the players. His little tricks help them. The younger squad members, in particular, listen to everything he says.Lukaku was one of the first to knock on his door. They are similar characters and have a very natural relationship. “I have already told Thierry Henry that I have found out his technique to score goals,” Lukaku has said. “I’m not yet there, but I’m slowly getting there.”Even in England they sometimes meet. “We discuss what I have to do better. I also talk him sometimes through some old games. One with Arsenal in the 2005-2006 season, for instance. I can tell you all about it, and then he brings out details from one of my matches, and together we look for ways in which I can do even better. I learn from him every day. The way of moving, how to find the spaces, control the ball as well as possible. He could do it all. I have learned so much from him.”As a coach Henry is in the first place an observer. He takes care of the attacking set pieces but during the open group sessions he stays in the background. Others do the talking. Before each session he puts out the cones and at the end he removes them. Usually, while waiting for the players to leave the pitch, he does tricks with the ball. “I think that this is mainly school for him – these are his first years as a coach,” Dries Mertens has said.Among the players Henry still likes to behave like one of the boys. He was seen playing basketball with Hazard and Benteke he watches games with Vincent Kompany, who lifted him in the air after the Brazil game he jokes around. “He is an idol for everyone within the group,” Youri Tielemans has said. “Someone who laughs very often and still has a boys’ mentality.”But will he be laughing if he helps Belgium to slay France?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/365065c8144f3d7eca36ee3c317eadd7fc1f79b7/0_148_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10acd68aa2624ce70659bd83d92e0d94","title":"football transfer rumours eden hazard to join real madrid","story":"Today’s fluff is still taking it all inFlorentino Pérez has not had time to sign off Cristiano Ronaldo’s £88m move to Juventus, for he has been scouting Russia high and low in search of his next golden galáctico.

The Croatia midfielder would spend four seasons at White Hart Lane and it was a period in which he had a close-up view of the travails of the England team the angst, anger and ision that characterised the feel of it.England would qualify for the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012 but there was little to write home about from either. They flopped at the former, with one of the low points being Wayne Rooney’s on-camera critique of the jeering travelling support after the group‑stage draw with Algeria, while they went into their shells at the latter to exit on penalties to Italy.Modric remembers all of the stuff about the disconnect between the nation and the squad how managing England was the Impossible Job. It would remain the case after his transfer to Real Madrid. As he racked up the titles, including one Champions League after the other, England continued to resemble a stuck record.What worries Modric and the rest of Croatia, as they prepare for the World Cup semi-final against England in Moscow on Wednesday, is their opponents’ new-found unity. Quite simply, it is not supposed to be this way but, listening to Modric and other members of the Croatia set-up after their penalty shootout victory against Russia in the quarter‑final on Saturday night, it was plain that Gareth Southgate’s work has left them wary.“They are looking strong as a team,” Modric said. “I don’t know if there is a different mentality but it seems that they are more like a team. They have this togetherness that is very important to have success.”Davor Suker, the former Croatia striker, who is now the president of the country’s football federation, echoed Modric’s sentiments. “What I would like is to face the England team of before but now they are very strong and we have to respect them,” Suker said. “It is not money that will play – or Ferraris or watches. It will be 11 warriors against 11.”Modric played with the England defenders Kyle Walker and Danny Rose at Tottenham while he remembers the baby steps of Harry Kane into the professional game. Kane played a clutch of Europa League ties at the beginning of the 2011‑12 season, including one – a 2-1 home defeat against PAOK Salonika – in which he and Modric started.“Harry was young and just coming up,” Modric said. “He was always a hard worker. I actually remember one story about him but I will keep it to myself.”That little tease drew a predictable reaction from the journalists in attendance but Modric was more forthcoming about a couple of matters that stand to shape the semi‑final – England’s set-piece prowess and the respective levels of fatigue.Modric and his team-mates watched England’s 2-0 regulation time win over Sweden in the quarter-final earlier on Saturday and they noted how Harry Maguire’s headed opener from a corner had shaped the occasion. Corners or free-kicks have led to seven goals for England in the tournament.Croatia suffered a damaging lapse on a Russia free-kick deep into extra time, which enabled Mario Fernandes to head the equaliser. They have conceded only three goals at the finals and one of the others came when they failed to defend a long throw into the box during the last‑16 penalty shootout victory against Denmark.Some of the Croatia players looked out on their feet during extra-time against Russia and bodies have started to buckle. The goalkeeper, Danijel Subasic, had carried a hamstring problem into the game, which he would feel at the end of normal time only to play on after treatment, while the right‑back Sime Vrsaljko was forced off in extra time with a knee injury.“England have suffered less than us,” Modric said. “And we have fewer days to recover for the semi-final than we did for the quarter-final. But it’s a semi-final. We will find the extra motivation, the extra everything.”Modric was excellent against Russia, his influence growing in the second half after Zlatko Dalic introduced the defensive midfielder, Marcelo Brozovic. Previously, Modric and Ivan Rakitic had played in the centre of a 4-2-3-1 formation now, they were released further forward, either side of Brozovic, in a 4-3-3. Modric has consistently looked better when he has played higher up the pitch and it is plain that one of England’s major challenges will be to nullify him.What has shone through from the Croatia camp is how much relish there is for the meeting with England. The belief is that, unlike Denmark, in particular, and Russia, Southgate’s team will try to make the game they will play on the front foot.“We like to play against teams like England because we have fast players and it will be open,” Vedran Corluka, the former Manchester City and Tottenham defender, said. “We both want to have the possession, we want to win. England’s style is a bit like Manchester City’s, especially with Stones who is always on the ball. Hopefully it will be like Wembley in 2007, when we won 3-2!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60b6c0dc4a15f4f3002a65591c2d4d27d3035bd0/0_34_2344_1406/master/2344.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026amp;s=2d09c97dbb84d9ef21c9b3d2d2ecfec3","title":"transfer window deals missed world cup europe big leagues","story":"While events in Russia have hogged the headlines, the market has rolled along.

In another sign of the changing times, Santi Cazorla and Jack Wilshere have left after their contracts expired.José Mourinho has spent big on reinforcements at Manchester United, with Brazilian midfielder Fred joining for £43.7m and right-back Diogo Dalot signed from Porto. Mourinho retains an interest in Lazio’s Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, who could cost close to £100m. Anthony Martial appears set to leave.Liverpool have been arguably the busiest of the top six, signing Fabinho and welcoming Naby Keïta to a revamped midfield now missing Emre Can. Attacking reinforcements are still required, with a move for Lyon’s Nabil Fekir stalling and Danny Ings set to depart. Tottenham have made another slow start to a summer window – but at least Harry Kane and manager Mauricio Pochettino have agreed new contracts.Manchester City are yet to complete a signing but are closing in on long-term targets Jorginho and Riyad Mahrez. Chelsea remain in a state of flux with Maurizio Sarri poised to replace Antonio Conte. Goalkeeper Alisson and Aleksandr Golovin are among their targets.West Ham have signed Toulouse centre-back Issa Diop for £22m, Swansea keeper Lukasz Fabianski for £7m and full-back Ryan Fredericks on a free.

Fulham have not made any signings, while Cardiff have bought Josh Murphy, Alex Smithies, Greg Cunningham and striker Bobby Reid from Championship sides.After a nail-biting title race Juventus are prepared to spend big to stay on top.

Emre Can arrives on a free, while £13m keeper Mattia Perin will battle for the No 1 jersey after Gigi Buffon’s departure.Napoli will be without manager Sarri and midfielder Jorginho after narrowly missing out on the title but new head coach Carlo Ancelotti has begun rebuilding, signing Bologna’s forward Simone Verdi, Betis midfielder Fabián Ruiz and goalkeeper Alex Meret, who joins from Udinese for £31m.Internazionale are back in the Champions League and have spent £33m on Radja Nainggolan and £20m on Argentinian prospect Lautaro Martínez, a striker. Defenders Stefan de Vrij and Kwadwo Asamoah have joined on frees. Milan have reined in their spending after falling foul of FFP rules but have added Pepe Reina, Ivan Strinic and Alen Halilovic on frees.Roma sporting director Monchi has brought in nine players, including Javier Pastore and Justin Kluivert. Lazio have spent £12.5m on signings including Salzburg midfielder Valon Berisha and may spend more if Milinkovic-Savic moves on.Fiorentina have landed promising Toulouse goalkeeper Alban Lafont for £7.5m, while Cagliari have signed veteran defender Darijo Srna and Sassuolo have picked up Kevin-Prince Boateng on a free.In the six weeks since Real Madrid won their third straight Champions League, Zinedine Zidane has been replaced by Julen Lopetegui and Ronaldo has edged towards the exit. The club have also signed Real Sociedad full-back Álvaro Odriozola for £35m, young goalkeeper Andriy Lunin and Santos midfielder Rodrygo, who will arrive next summer.It’s been a busy window across the capital at Atlético, too. Monaco’s Thomas Lemar will arrive for £52.7m and Antoine Griezmann has signed a new contract. Diego Simeone has also signed former academy player Rodri from Villarreal, and Argentinian defender Nehuen Pérez. Barcelona missed out on Griezmann but Brazilian midfielder Arthur is set to join. Another Brazilian, Paulino, has returned to Guangzhou Evergrande.Valencia have signed Geoffrey Kondogbia after a loan and spent £13m on Lyon defender Mouctar Diakhaby. The sale of Cancelo means the club are in credit. Villarreal have been busy – Cazorla returns on a free, Ramiro Funes Mori joins from Everton, and forwards Gérard Moreno and Karl Toko Ekambi have been signed for £36m.Real Betis were La Liga’s surprise success story last season and the free signings of Sergio Canales and World Cup star Takashi Inui look like excellent business. Across town, Sevilla have signed Lille’s Ibrahim Amadou and Swansea’s Roque Mesa.Bayern Munich got their main target in January, agreeing a deal to get Leon Goretzka from Schalke on a free. Schalke finished second last season and have spent smartly. Five players have been recruited for a total £25m, including Hannover centre-back Salif Sané and Hoffenheim forward Mark Uth.Ahead of Julian Nagelsmann’s last season at Hoffenheim before the manager joins Leipzig, forwards Vincenzo Grifo and Leonardo Bittencourt have joined from Gladbach and Cologne. Dortmund are rebuilding under new coach Lucien Favre, who has signed defender Abdou Diallo and Danish playmaker Thomas Delaney.Brazilian winger Paulinho could be one to watch at Leverkusen, who have also brought in defender Mitchell Weiser and Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky. Leipzig have used the Keïta fee to sign Montpellier defender Nordi Mukiele and attacking talents Matheus Cunha and Marcelo Saracchi.Paris St-Germain will be among the heavy spenders again – having agreed a £160m fee for Kylian Mbappé with Monaco last summer – and signed Buffon on a free. Pastore has departed, along with Bilbao-bound Yuri Berchiche and striker Odsonne Édouard, who has joined Celtic. Monaco have continued to invest in youth, with 16-year-old Willem Geubbels joining from Lyon for £14m.Lyon have signed Nantes full-back Léo Dubois for free, while Diakhaby has left for Valencia. Marseille have been linked with a move for Mario Balotelli, while Dimitri Payet may make a shock return to West Ham. Patrick Vieira’s Nice have signed midfielder Danilo from Braga, while Toulouse have made six signings including John Bostock from Bursaspor."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba6e87bad7269df3ab3338da2928f19063019cc/0_118_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1c5d258458e948e6e4fa5d01436f32","title":"england into semi finals croatia end russias run world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s quarter-final win, Croatia’s punishing victory over hosts Russia, Cristiano Ronaldo transfer machinations, Croydon bus stops and baby choices"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01149fd9270da71428b8abdd7352f86da95ed28b/0_43_3394_2037/master/3394.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db37a1b426a0469182165b82f02208d4","title":"martinez southgate belgium england world cup semi finals","story":"Roberto Martínez lives on the outskirts of Wigan, the dormitory village on the edge of the Lancashire plain proving as convenient a base for managing Belgium as it was for his previous jobs at Wigan Athletic and Everton.It is already becoming easy to forget the man who sent Brazil home early from Russia was practically run out of town while in his last Premier League post certainly by the end of the 2015-16 season there were not too many Everton supporters sorry to see him go. It is quite a neat trick using a World Cup to reinvent yourself without actually changing very much, though that is exactly what Gareth Southgate has also managed to do with England.Should Belgium and England end up facing each other on Sunday, an almost laughable prospect when the tournament started but a very real possibility now, the similarities between the managers will be difficult to ignore. Both were in charge of teams relegated from the Premier League for a start, which whatever his other faults was not a charge that could be levelled at Sam Allardyce.Martínez will always have that rather splendid FA Cup final win of 2013 on his CV, though he and Southgate seemed to have their managerial limitations exposed when tasked with taking Everton and Middlesbrough forward. Southgate claims his best work was done at Boro, Martínez can look back at one encouraging season after promising to take Everton into the Champions League, but the inescapable reality is that no Premier League club was beating a path to either manager’s door once they became available.Both in slightly different ways were considered too open and naive for the sharp-elbowed Premier League. Martínez because he placed too much emphasis on possession and paid too little attention to defence, Southgate because no one could imagine him raising his voice in the dressing room or resorting to scrapping tactics when the need arose.Those perceptions have changed now the pair have reached the World Cup semi-finals, yet the managers in question have stayed the same. Southgate is being lauded for the very politeness and honesty that seemed to undermine him at club level – people are even saying his guileless decent-bloke persona would make a refreshing change to the political landscape – while Martínez has found himself in charge of some of the best attacking players on the planet.A suspicion of defensive frailty remains – not too many teams in the knockout stage would have found themselves having to come back from two goals down against Japan – though Martínez does not appear too worried about it. What do you do when you are blessed with attacking players of the quality of Eden Hazard, Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku? Appoint Thierry Henry as your assistant of course.So have Bob and Gary just got lucky, or does international football suit some managers in a way club football does not? A bit of both is the probable answer. Anyone in the world would consider themselves lucky to be in charge of the present England and Belgium squads.Southgate might have been promoted by default but he found it easy to make a natural break with the past and let some emerging young talent come through. Belgium have had a winning team on paper for some years and Martínez was by no means an obvious candidate for the opportunity to release that potential on the pitch but even those who still choose to regard him as a smooth-talking chancer will have to admit that putting out Brazil represents significant improvement.It may well be the case also that tournament football, because it is intense and short term, suits some managers better than the season-long slog at club level. At national level a manager does not have the responsibility of sourcing players or spending the club’s money either, and anyone familiar with Martínez’s wildly inconsistent forays into the transfer market will understand that is sometimes a relief.Yet though it might be true Southgate and Martínez are managing to make the most of promising situations, like Chris Coleman harnessing team spirit and riding a wave of national fervour with Wales at Euro 16, it should not be assumed their success shows anyone can do it.Southgate in particular has changed the way England play. It was his preference to select Harry Maguire, play with a back three and move Kyle Walker in from full-back, and all three bold decisions have been vindicated. Jesse Lingard might not even have made some managers’ squads, yet Southgate has turned him into a key member of the team. Southgate stood behind Jordan Pickford when the goalkeeper drew some criticism in the group stage and it is fair to say that call also went well.Martínez managed to think on his feet when Belgium went behind against Japan, something he did not always seem capable of doing at club level, and effectively turned the game with the introduction of Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli. That reconstructed midfield remained in place for the Brazil game, where Martínez also deserved credit for devising a shape to bring the best out of his three most potent attackers. He played Lukaku and Hazard up front but not central, with De Bruyne allowed to come through the middle as the forward tip of a midfield diamond. Lukaku’s strength and De Bruyne’s deadly finishing were both seen to good effect in Belgium’s second goal against Brazil, as classically executed a counterattack as you will see at this tournament.How the story ends remains to be seen, though it will end, in just less than a week. By that time either Bob or Gary could be striding the world like a colossus, installed as national manager on a more or less permanent basis like Joachim Löw, or they could be tormenting themselves by recalling what happened to Coleman after Wales, when he was obliged to try to prove himself all over again at Sunderland.Right now, however, club football and relegation concerns must seem a world away. Reaching a World Cup semi-final is already an outstanding achievement but there could be so much more to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d7d5f6a10a5a671c9c9b1a151c91476ef289fe/0_0_4648_3132/master/4648.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ce2cd67768d6526330b481d7fa390ea7 960w","title":"world cup 2018 buildup to the semi finals begins live","story":"Hello, Gregg here. Right, back to the news that Luis Enrique has taken the Spain job. The president of the Spanish Football Federation, Luis Rubiales, has said that their new coach turned down better paid roles to take on the challenge of reinvigorating the national team. At first glance, it seems somewhat of a coup but then this World Cup has shown that managers who haven’t had stellar club careers can do just as well as those who have.Right, I’m going to pop away for a bit of luncheon. Gregg Bakowski will fill in. I leave you with an email: “Has anyone else noticed the parallels between Gareth’s boys and the all conquering England Rugby team of 2003?” wonders Duncan Watanabe. “Both teams, while perhaps not as pleasing to the eye as other sides, arewere extremely well-prepared, well-organised and well-drilled with new set play ideas and a well mannered hero who you can always depend on to slam home the penalties!”The BBC are showing the 1990 World Cup semi-final between England and West Germany in full online at the moment (if you’re in the UK you can watch it here). The most striking thing about what I’ve seen of it so far (the second half has just got under way) is the prevalence of the back-pass as an easy way of getting out of defensive difficulties.News just in: this sad-looking bear thinks Belgium are going to beat France, based on it doing something it didn’t understand.Official: Luis Enrique is the new coach of Spain:This, meanwhile, was the half-time entertainment at Xolos Tijuana in Mexico on Saturday, midway through a friendly against the Costa Rican side Herediano. It’s a “Neymar Challenge”, in which participants compete to see who can roll along the ground the greatest distance while screaming in pain (courtesy of FourFourTwo).It’s all happening in Spain, where a new head coach is expected to be announced this afternoon. This from Reuters:The Spanish Football Federation has appointed Jose Francisco Molina as Spain’s new sporting director but it has delayed naming a new national team coach until after it holds a board meeting later on Monday. The new head coach of Spain’s national team needed to be a person of strong character, President of Spain’s Football Federation Luis Rubiales said during a press conference. “What we are looking for is an undeniable leader in the dressing room, who sets a pattern and that no one deviates from that pattern, and that is the selection of the future we have devised,” Rubiales said, adding that an official announcement would be made this afternoon. Local media reported earlier on Monday that former Barcelona coach Luis Enrique will be the next national team coach. It must feel absolutely bizarre to be Gareth Southgate at the moment.England have held a behind-closed-doors training session, and are declaring that everybody is fit and well, though as we’ve discovered there is always the possibility that this is just disinformation, and in fact England’s last two fit players went to the cinema.This just in from the Corrigan Brothers, the people behind the Irish No24 hit, There’s No One as Irish as Barack Obama:The Irish band the Corrigan Brothers from Limerick are celebrating a fellow Limierck Man in song. The brothers who have played President Obama’s inauguration and charted all over the world with their multi million youtube hit “There’s no one as Irish as Barack Obama” are celebrating Limerick’s Harry Kane and have released “There’s no one as Irish as Harry Kane”. Ger Corrigan, lead singer with the band said: ‘We heard that Harry’s Grandmother Theresa Fitzgerald is from Caherline in Limerick and we felt we had to celebrate Harry. He is not the best striker that Limerick has ever produced, he is second to Des Kennedy, our Limerick Legend, the man who couldn’t stop scoring against Real Madrid in our great European Cup Campaign in 1980.’ The Corrigan Brothers look forward to performing the song for Harry when he brings the Golden Boot home to Limerick. “While I don’t think that Mark Geiger of USA was baised, his performance in England vs Colombia wasn’t very assured,” writes Mike MacKenzie in Canada. “I’m surprised that he wasn’t sent home, especially with 12 refs still on hand.” I have to agree with this. I’d still be extremely surprised to see him back on the pitch in this tournament.So there are still 12 referees, and only four games left for them to officiate. The only referee to have taken charge of a knock-out game who has subsequently been sent home is Damir Skomina, whose officiating of Sweden 1-0 Switzerland obviously displeased somebody.Fifa have taken the pruning sheers to their referees’ list, and these are the officials that are still on it:And here’s Luka Modric on England, in which he refuses to tell us an interesting story about Harry Kane. “Harry was young and just coming up,” Modric said about his time at Tottenham. “He was always a hard worker. I actually remember one story about him but I will keep it to myself.”Here’s a piece on Jordan Henderson:Jordan Henderson limped away from the Samara Arena on Saturday evening offering up a few optimistic soundbites as he went. “It doesn’t feel too bad,” was swiftly followed up with “hopefully it’ll be fine”. But it says everything about the impact the Liverpool midfielder has made in Russia that the admission he had overstretched an already tight hamstring late on in the victory against Sweden instantly spread a sense of dread among his audience. Henderson, a figure who has rather ided opinion over the years, is established as this team’s heartbeat. Colombia’s team doctor has admitted he lied about James Rodriguez’s injury, and says such misinformation is “part of the game”. I report this without judgement: I think he’s right, and in a similar position would say pretty much anything that seemed useful:On the subject of Russian cuisine, here’s a mouthwatering picture of Barney Ronay’s breakfast buffet yesterday:In the absence of actual football to report on, Reuters have sent over a piece about Russian food:Many soccer fans knew little or nothing about Russian cuisine before the World Cup, but have tucked into local gastronomy with relish, trying everything from luxurious caviar to staples like veal tongue.Russian food is often thought of as bland and heavy, and indeed many dishes seem geared towards getting people through the gruelling winter rather than amusing their palates. But 28 year-old Egyptian Ahmed Morsy has made it a point of trying a new Russian dish every day. Meat-filled pelmeni dumplings and Beef stroganoff rank among his favourites. “I love it, honestly. It’s better than I expected. I don’t like spicy food myself so for me it was perfect,” said Morsy as he perused a restaurant menu in the sweltering southern city of Volgograd. “The whole country has exceeded my expectations. I had never been to Russia before, I thought the people would be grumpy and the country not that organised,” he said. Indeed, most fans have been impressed by Russians - some in remote or industrial towns where tourists rarely tread - bending over backwards to help, dispelling preconceptions and spreading an upbeat atmosphere. “I thought Russian food might be weird. I haven’t found it weird. But I do prefer the Uzbek and Azerbaijani barbecue,” said Morsy’s university pal Mamdooh El Eleila, 29, who ordered Kiev chicken, a fillet that is either fried or baked. Indeed, food from nearby countries - particularly spicier Georgian cuisine - has been particularly popular with fans looking for a little more piquancy in their plates. Caviar bars and vodka cocktails have also been prized. Still, some fans from countries like India and Mexico, renowned for their succulent spicy fare, have not been impressed. “The flavours here are quite salty. And of course we miss chili,” said Ricardo Garcia, a 32 year-old programmer decked out in the green Mexican football jersey. “We brought hot sauce with us from Mexico but we forgot it in our last hostel and now were suffering a little. We found some ketchup with chili in a supermarket and that helps a little, but it’s not the same.” His pal Heriberto Gonzalez, however, was far more upbeat. “There are some soups that any Mexican mothers could prepare! Borscht, for example, because they use the potato in a very similar way. Of course, there’s a little bitter Russian flavour to it,” said Gonzalez, a 37 year-old who works in marketing. “But if I wanted Mexican food, I would have stayed in Mexico!” Some fans, however, have found temporary refuge in their own cuisine - like Egyptian physics student Ahmed Nasr, who was queuing for a shawarma. But he said local waiters and chefs had also prodded him - via Google Translate - to try local fares including Russian lamb and buckwheat. “I was at a buffet and the staff encouraged me to try Russian food. I liked it. I did not even know what they ate in Russia,” said Nasr, 31, who lives in Canada. “In Canada we have Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern food, but I’ve never seen Russian. Maybe I will look for a Russian restaurant - hopefully I can find one!” he laughed.“Getting exciting, isn’t it!” writes Will Hargreaves. Well, I’d say it was exciting from the beginning, but has now become tense and nervous and a little bit surreal. “That acknowledged, I don’t think that Snr Martinez has actually wet himself. I think that striding across the middle of the sprinkler avoids this occurrence. Another piece of tactical genius from the Belgium leader.”Well, perhaps. I thought perhaps he’d misjudged it, as one of two streams of water coming out of the sprinkler appeared to end in his groinal area. Here, though, is something else that the Belgians have been working on in training: ball-levitation:This article in the New York Times about the bizarre circus that is the World Cup press conference is very good.There will be no ban, so long as he doesn’t repeat the offence: Fifa yesterday said their disciplinary committee had “sent a warning to the player Domagoj Vida due to his video statement following the 2018 Fifa World Cup match between Russia and Croatia”, which is as far as they are going to go for now.Belgium have been training already today, a session in which Roberto Martinez appears to have quite deliberately wet himself.There’s not a lot of official World Cup activity scheduled today, but this is what I’ve got (all times BST):1.30pm England “media opportunity”. I don’t know if this is a full-blown press conference or simply a game of darts.2.45pm France will hold a press conference in St Petersburg, featuring Didier Deschamps and Hugo Lloris.4pm Croatia hold a press conference in Moscow.5pm Belgium hold a press conference in St Petersburg, with Roberto Martinez and Kevin de Bruyne involved.Andy Perkins has come up with perhaps the definitive response to Naaman’s earlier call for a proposed list of England penalty takers: “My five penalty takers for England. Kane, RashfordVardy, Trippier, Young, Maguire with his head.” England’s official twitter account has recycled some old photos to mark Ashley Young’s birthday. They’d probably have liked to do something a bit more special, but are busy baking.Though while the World Cup was on there was also this giant cake and near-lifesize chocolate Messi:The World Cup cake bar was raised just a few days ago, when someone at Croatia’s team hotel baked this for Dejan Lovren:It is Ashley Young’s birthday today. I wonder what’s planned for him at the England camp. An awkward cake-cutting photo opportunity at the very least, I’d wager.I notice the Wikipedia page on Winchester has been updated to reflect someone’s strange fantasy that emerged from the fact that Ousmane Dembélé started a Football Manager game as manager of Winchester FC during this World Cup:Winchester has Winchester City F.C. who currently play in the Southern League and Winchester Castle F.C., who have played in the Hampshire League since 1971. The local Saturday football league, the Winchester \u0026amp District League, folded in 2010. After France’s crushing victory over England in the 2018 World Cup Final (10-0), Ousmane Dembele was appointed manager, with the intention of bringing a Southern American atmosphere to the club.Hello world! Simon Burnton here, taking over for the next, well, while. I start with more news on Belgium’s team quiz. This is a pretty hard photo round, in my opinion. How many faces can you put names to?And with that, I’ll be handing over to my colleague Simon Burnton. Thanks for reading along, roasting managers, and joining me as we wait for the football to start (but hopefully, never end). Goalkeeping kit disaster! George Garrett writes: “Disaster! Forget the white, the tweet said YELLOW goalkeeper shirts. Which is what Paul Robinson was wearing when Gary Neville’s pass-back bobbled over his foot in Zagreb in 2006 and what Scott Carson was wearing when Steve McClaren wanted shelter from the rain a year later. Terrible omen!”’s own Priya Ramesh has also made this point, and far better than I have. It’s not news that black players are always analysed and described in the vocabulary of brawn a little more than brain. But it remains something to keep an eye on, in my opinion.Romelu Lukaku is smart. We need to talking about it more. Too often the analysis boils down to the cliches of power and pace, but the evidence is before us. That run really is a thing of beauty, and a lesson in intelligence, quick wit and movement. In Russia, the Belgian striker has consistently excelled in his build-up play. It’s been a tournament for appreciating strikers’ off-the-ball work – Giroud, Griezemann, Firmino etc. – and it’s time Lukaku got the acclaim too. He’s nabbed the goals, made the runs and his passing, especially to De Bruyne for that lethal stab against Brazil, has been spot on. I’ve just been informed that Round 4 of the Belgian team’s trivia night is probably about past goals of the tournament. Answer no.3, Saeed Al-Owairan, is remembered for this effort from USA 1994.Could the question have been about best goals scored against Belgium?In a spot of non-World Cup transfer news, Cristiano Ronaldo has dropped what seems to be another hint at the Juventus transfer rumours swirling around.Also Paulinho’s headed back to Guangzhou Evergrande after a fairly successful season at Barcelona. Ok. Ok some tactics. This is required reading for any England fan. A breakdown of that super-effective, Lincoln City-inspired corner routine that brought Maguire’s opener against Sweden. Click through for the rest!  You can see the answers in the fourth photo, from which I am trying to reverse-engineer the questions. Round 1: Name all the Germans who scored in the 7-1 defeat of Brazil? Round 3: Which stadiums and cities hosted the 2010 and 1998 finals?Can anyone else shed some light? Step forward José Pékerman – or rather, don’t. KevBod has a great shout for the Colombian coach as Worst Dressed Manager.On the subject of worst dressed manager - while Sampaoli is an obvious choice, he could have got away with it with around 2 stone less girth and a permanent demeanour of shit, I\u0027ve left the gas on at home didn\u0027t help either (might partly explain why the team played like startled rabbits as well) . I\u0027d vote for Pekerman - absolutely fine until you look at his feet (not with a suit for goodness sake man!).Far out, this is spot on. Look at this unflattering photo I picked out from the exit to England. He looks like a toy soldier stuck on a hotplate – plastic all pooling down to his feet.Sampaoli owns a tanning salon in Macclesfield, drives an Audi A3 with £16k finance outstanding and stands at the bar in Yates\u0027s Wine Lodge drinking Czech lager FACT.Not only was Jogi Löw poorly dressed, but in a bit of a follow-up to his Euro 2016 scratch-and-sniff antics, this year he could be seen very slyly picking his nose and eating the \u0027treasure\u0027, seemingly not realising he was on camera being watched by millions of people around the world. Lesson most definitely not learnt.Crucial kit news. Sound the klaxon, England will face Croatia in all-white. I’m seeing a mixed response in the replies. The dreamers say it’s a good omen – England wore white in the semi in 1966, then went and won the thing in red. But the away strip has the stats behind it. England are on an eight-year unbeaten streak in red, with 9 wins and 8 draws since losing to Germany in South Africa. Folks this is gonna decide it all!Ah Tony06, I’m with you there. I guarantee I haven’t forgotten Aliou Cissé. Still my pick for the coolest manager, gutted that he and his team went home so early, and definitely a sex symbol. He trumps Sir Gareth for style icon in my opinion. Memories are short. Remember that before Southgate-mania swept the UK, it was generally agreed that the coolest manager was Senegal\u0027s Aliou Cissé. With his dreadlocks, unique body language, being the only black manager at the World Cup.... he was even asked about being a sex symbol at a press conference, for goodness\u0027 sake!Its very hard to pull off a v neck on a guy... got to be young and pretty with a nice flat chest for it to look elegant rather than naff..She said yes! Congrats Bozza and Sara. Here’s today’s plan for Belgium: I don’t quite get the activity listed for 8.30 though. Physio, games and squad bonding? Any suggestions? Oi everyone in the comments – fewer Brexit jokes and more submissions for Worst Dressed Manager please. Here’s the man to beat: And if you’re into the 28 club curse... Then don’t pick: Ashley Young (32), Gary Cahill (32), Jamie Vardy (31), Fabian Delph (28), Kyle Walker (28) or Danny Rose, who turned 28 just last Monday. At 19, Trent Alexander-Arnold is the youngest in the squad. Give him a go Gareth! The 28 club and Jordan Henderson. I’ve seen this stat doing the rounds, that the only England player to miss a penalty against Colombia was over 28. Kane (24), Rashford (20), Trippier (27) and Dier (24) all put them away – unburdened via youth of England’s past penalty horror. Hendo, who just turned 28 on the 17th of June, had a pretty good effort saved. This is just a roundabout way of asking – if it comes down to it again – who do you want taking the penalties? Send me through your first 5. Yep, what a World Cup.This is a summer that people will still be talking about when your kids kids are old.Full sun everyday, decent heat, a wonderful football tournament.... and it all just crept up on us.Just glad that Brazil, Germany and Spain cannot win again. World football needs a new champion or at least a team that has not won for a long time. France won in \u002798 so I would be happy to see England, Croatia or Belgium win.It’s fair to say hopes are high for Belgium v France. Neighbours, rivals, two fantastically talented attacking squads. And in the middle of it all, Thierry Henry. His influence on this Belgium team has given an already mouthwatering clash extra spice. Henry’s presence on Belgium’s bench for their semi-final against France on Tuesday has prompted no shortage of comment from Les Bleus. “It’s bizarre,” Didier Deschamps told Téléfoot. Olivier Giroud was more forthright. “I would be proud to show Titi that he chose the wrong camp.”He’s got no goals, but Giroud could Guivarc’h (I’m using it as a verb) France past Belgium and beyond, writes Stuart James.While Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann enjoy the limelight Giroud is quietly going about his business, out of the race for the Golden Boot but well in the running for a World Cup winner’s medal. Left out of the starting XI for the opening game, Giroud has selflessly played the role of target man since, giving Mbappé and Griezmann the freedom to flourish.Here’s how England’s players are spending their rest days. I have the exact same set up going now in the ’s Sydney office.Me and Mike Hytner are recreating this as we speak.Belgium to win it all, England to lose the final, and France and Croatia out in the semis. Well that’s what the latest power rankings say. Read on:Nakul Bhagwat writes in with the first email. And it’s a cracker. “Long time reader, first time writer,” he begins. “Sir Gareth seems to be the consensus choice for best dressed manager at this year’s World Cup. Who was the worst dressed? My nomination is Jorge Sampaoli with his slightly too tight t-shirts, which (fittingly) seemed to be buckling under the pressure.”Great pick, Nakul. I’ll say Joachim Löw. Eight years ago, I thought his wavy fringe and European v-neck were a breath of fresh air. But there was something about this year’s number, a thin blue t-shirt, that seemed to be tight in all the wrong places. And yes, the comments were off there for about 20 minutes, but they’re back now! Sound off below the line – who can take Sampaoli’s ill-fitting crown?Er...congratulations Bozza? Mark Bosnich, who is now plying his trade as a pundit for Fox Sports Australia, has just proposed to his partner. Via selfie cam. From Russia. With the wind all rattling in the speaker. Hope she says yes.Spain news: Luis Enrique is the national team’s new manager. It’s in all the papers and leading all the radio bulletins. It will be officially announced, by bigwig Luis Rubiales no doubt, later today. But it looks a done deal. The former Barcelona coach will be appointed permanently now that Fernando Hierro’s rather unsuccessful caretaker stint is over. Enrique, who won the 2015 Champions League with that fearsome trident of Messi, Neymar and Suarez, has been on sabbatical since he left the Nou Camp in May last year.In the eighth episode of the Simpsons’s fourth season (New Kid on the Block), Bart falls in love. Stay with me here. He’s so happy when Laura Powers, the object of his affection, touches his hand that he doesn’t wash it for days, trying to prolong that moment for as long as he can.Well this is my attempt – in vain of course – to do the same for this World Cup. I’ll say it. I don’t want it to end. If it would give us another week, another round, I’d never wash these liveblogging fingers again.But it doesn’t work like that. We are rocketing towards the end, everything converging inwards. The absolute tragedy of competition is this horrible exponential sense of footballing decay. Four matches left. How? After Saturday, one. So I’m grateful, more than you can believe, for today. This blog is another day to discuss, theorise, to imagine all those classic clashes-in-waiting before the reality hits – of a grim 0-0 in one, a match-ending Mario Mandžukić deflection in the other, and the end.This might only be a rest day, but that’s another day when this isn’t over yet. England are already in dreamland. Croatia and Belgium? They are too. Let’s try and stay there, at least a little while longer. Email me at naaman.zhou@the, and tweet me at @naamanzhou. Or as always, comment below the line. Let’s keep this going.

In an effort to encourage them, many state governments now offer money to couples when one partner is from a low caste or is a Dalit (formerly known as untouchable). On 3 July, the Orissa government increased the cash “incentive” from 100,000 rupees (£1,095) to 250,000 rupees. Hitesh Dhingra, co-founder of dating app TrulyMadly, believes there are two reasons for the enlightened views expressed in the survey. One is that young Indians, as users of the internet and social media, are exposed to new ideas that challenge traditional social mores.The other is that, as more millennials choose their partners using dating apps and websites, they are more likely to focus on personality and compatibility than caste and religion. “In an arranged marriage, the parents are going to stick to tradition and to caste considerations,” said Dhingra. “But when young people are out there looking for a partner themselves, then the criteria change. Caste, religion, and income are not uppermost. It’s the person’s personality and behaviour that are important. The whole approach becomes more open-minded.”“What we are seeing are the markers of a new generation that has been shaped by the internet and influenced by attitudes and behaviour they see in developed countries,” said Iqbal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdc38bf2f021229ba2a71f755c7a7dd7197caf29/0_881_6730_4038/master/6730.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5c19b182326585cdc26c5f4a86827a","title":"anna jones courgette recipes","story":"Try roasting small courgettes in a simple, one-pot dish, or grate and turn into cheesy fritters for a quick and easy light mealNow is the courgette’s time to shine.

It’s the moment to reach over your run-of-the-mill green courgette for the likes of scallop-edged patty pans, which I’ve been roasting whole with a hint of sweet and a hit of sour. The small, sweet courgettes I’ve sliced paper-thin and dressed with mint, basil, lemon, oil, salt and nothing more – and then I’ve turned any lingering in the fridge into these fritters: courgettes, halloumi and a quick chilli jam to perk up the plate.I use both rice flour and plain flour here, which I think together are key to the crispness of these fritters. If using two flours is a step too far, then plain, spelt or rice by themselves would work fine.

Is this a health risk, or no worse than coffee?When Red Bull launched in the UK in 1994, with its odd, cough-linctus flavour and novel billing as an “energy drink”, students and clubbers went mad for the stuff. The brand quickly became a cheap and legal staple for staying up all night. A quarter of a century later, the energy drinks market is still growing and flooded with Red Bull competitors such as Relentless, Monster Energy and Emerge. And it is no longer just young adults guzzling them to study or rave into the small hours these brands are catnip to children.Energy drinks are classified as soft drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. Many brands, however, including Monster, Rockstar and Red Bull (still the world’s bestselling energy drink) contain more than twice that amount. While, at about 300mg per litre, this is less than filter coffee (about 400mg per litre), the drinks are way more quaffable to children. The ESFA say just one can of some brands could exceed their recommended daily caffeine limit for children.Amelia Lake is a reader in public health nutrition at Teeside University and co-author of the 2017 study for which school children were interviewed. “Coffee is very different,” she says. “It’s hot, not necessarily full of sugar and you can’t gulp it down. You can’t have three or four one after another, like you can with these drinks.” With highly palatable flavours such as tropical fruits and blueberry, they are to coffee what alcopops are to vodka.Lake says that the health concerns don’t stop at sugar and caffeine. “There’s the cocktail of the other things in these drinks – the guanine, taurine, various other what are called healthy ingredients. We don’t have a lot of evidence about what the combination does to adults or children.” Taurine is an amino acid found in meat and fish that is claimed to enhance concentration (among its many other biological functions), especially when combined with caffeine and guanine – a stimulant derived from the South American guarana plant.In 2016, Lake and colleagues reviewed the academic literature on energy drinks from Europe and the US. They found associations between consuming the drinks with symptoms including headaches, stomach aches, hyperactivity, insomnia, fatigue and irritation. There were also higher incidences among energy drink fans of injuries, driving violations and road accidents. In the US in 2010-11, the National Poison Data System received 4,854 calls about energy drink cases. Almost half involved children under six years old, but it was among older children that more grave effects such as cardiac rhythm disturbances and hypertension were reported.Furthermore – perhaps indicating that the drinks are seen as a legal high for children – several studies in the review found strong links between choosing energy drinks, sensation seeking and other self-destructive behaviours such as binge-drinking, smoking and substance abuse, along with problems with behavioural regulation and metacognitive skills (such as planning and problem-solving). Lake is keen to point out, however, that, short of conducting unethical experiments that involve dosing children up with caffeine in a laboratory, we are having to make do with associations rather than finding any proof of causation.According to EU labelling guidelines, soft drinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre must carry a warning about the high caffeine content and state that they are not recommended for children. But wouldn’t this make the drinks even more irresistible to children? “I don’t think it’s a silver bullet,” says Lake, “but it’s a good first step.” Some of her research was prompted by concerned parent groups. “There was confusion around who and what these drinks are for, with incidences of children having them for breakfast,” says Lake, lamenting that even though “the cans say they’re not for children, we sell them to children anyway”. Energy drink consumption by children in the UK is the highest in Europe.Earlier this year, the major UK supermarkets committed to not selling the drinks to under-16s, but convenience stores and vending machines are ubiquitous. The government has now proposed a ban on selling the drinks to under-16s, to combat childhood obesity. “If you look wider,” says Lake, “other countries have been ahead of this curve for a while now. Some countries have outright bans some have banned sales to under-18s.”The health secretary has also proposed a 9pm watershed for junk-food advertising, but the way that energy drinks are promoted is many-tentacled. The brands have forged strong associations with gaming, extreme sports, Formula One racing, clubbing and music, using social media, event sponsorship and web content. As Beckett says, the marketing is “very attractive to young people, with a lot of social media, YouTube channels ... Monster has been very savvy advertising through the gaming world. These are whole other areas of a marketing universe that’s on the radar of young people, but not their parents.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef4f0544b595a2114db9a540734cad7fc66b471/0_2245_4008_2405/master/4008.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=097ffc943bef353960844a452c2c28e8","title":"seven ways to avoid urinary tract infections","story":"Ensuring you drink plenty of water throughout the day may decrease your risk of getting a UTI.Take regular trips to the toilet to empty your bladder. “Holding it in” may result in bacteria having the opportunity to multiply in your urinary tract, giving you an increased risk of infection.Women should be encouraged to empty their bladder after sex. Bacteria can be introduced to the urinary tract during foreplay or sexual intercourse, which should be expelled before the bacteria are allowed to multiply and cause an infection. Additionally, think about what type of contraception you are using – some people find using spermicides can increase UTIs, as can diaphragms.D-Mannose is a natural sugar thought to aid in the removal of E coli during a UTI and stop the infection in its tracks. Recent, small studies have looked at the use of D-Mannose oral powder and compared it with prophylactic antibiotics, and have shown promising results.If you are experiencing UTI symptoms (eg pain on urination, or increased frequency) you should see a doctor, particularly if you suffer from recurring UTIs. You may need a course of antibiotics or possibly an ultrasound scan to investigate the cause of the recurring infection. For example, it could be due to an anatomical abnormality or an inability to fully empty your bladder. A weakened immune system could be causing the repeat infections, which would need further investigation.After visiting the toilet, wiping from back to front can increase the risk of getting a UTI, as you could introduce faecal bacteria into the urinary tract. However, overcleaning is not the answer, as using too many products can alter your flora and raise the risk of getting a UTI.Oestrogen is believed to be protective against UTIs via a variety of mechanisms, meaning that menopausal women with declining oestrogen may be vulnerable to UTIs. In a meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials, it was found that topical vaginal oestrogen was beneficial in reducing UTIs in post-menopausal women.Cranberries and cranberry juice have long been suggested as treatments for UTIs. But studies have shown mixed data on how successful they are. Cranberries contain proanthocyanidins, believed to prevent bacteria from “clinging on” inside your bladder. But cranberry juice may not be that useful, as it can be minimal in actual cranberry content and full of sugar and additives instead – so make sure you get cranberries in a raw form if you want to try this method. If you try a vodka and cranberry while you have a UTI, be aware that the alcohol may irritate your bladder and bring you back to square one with the symptoms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

In an age of melting ice caps and deadly heatwaves, surprisingly few musicians have tackled the calamity awaiting us. But through his increasingly unclassifiable albums, American electronic musician Daniel Lopatin – AKA Oneohtrix Point Never – has been edging towards the precipice for a closer look. His latest, Age Of, is a dizzying synthesis of the concepts he has been toying with since his 2013 album R Plus Seven: high-definition computer music, abstract in shape yet piercingly emotional. Age Of, according to Lopatin, is imagined as the sentimental musings of some advanced artificial intelligence looking back on the follies of humanity. The album evolved from a “concertscape” called Myriad, which Lopatin brings to London on a sticky summer night.The multimedia performance is set against a backdrop of Nate Boyce’s grotesque CGI visuals and hanging sculptures, which loom like aborted HR Giger monsters. Lopatin is flanked by pianist Kelly Moran, drummer and percussionist Eli Keszler, and Aaron David Ross, who plays an array of cinematic synths and special effects They pull off a jaw-dropping performance: a faithful yet fluid rendition of an album that, on record, seems laden with computer-assisted compositional quirks no human could master.Lopatin’s band operate in blinding high-definition as they work through almost every track from Age Of, interspersed with brief, scrambled messages that seem to emanate from the ghoulish sculptures. With virtuosic skill, Moran replicates the knotty neo-baroque melodies of Toys 2 and Age Of, while the glittering chug of Warning harks back to one of Lopatin’s deepest influences, Tangerine Dream. Keszler’s unorthodox drum kit produces cloudbursts of rhythm, as if he was playing a prepared piano. These vivid, top-end details are ballasted by Lopatin and Ross’s thunderous electronics, which unlock the space’s full potential on Same and a seismic We’ll Take It. For an extra twist of surrealism, a troupe of dancing cowgirls rodeo-kick their way around the room during the melancholy outpouring of Black Snow, one of Lopatin’s rare vocal performances. On Babylon, too, his Auto-Tuned warble is tender and affecting – a digital tool adding a human touch.They end on a cover of British freak-folk singer Bill Fay and his cosmically attuned Never Ending Happening (“Just to be a part of it is astonishing to me  The never ending happening”) before dipping into the back catalogue for an encore of Child of Rage and the crowd-pleasing epic Chrome Country.Lopatin’s unpredictable blend of digital and acoustic sound has drawn comparisons with the Fourth World exotica of Brian Eno and Jon Hassell. Those artists used the cutting-edge technology of the 1980s to imagine a world of infinite connections across time and space, yet Lopatin’s vision is less utopian. Age Of is the sound of overload, of data dumps and leaking landfill, of the Anthropocene: the moment when our presence on Earth leaves irreparable geological scars. But where his collaborator Anohni (who adds soaring vocals to several Age Of tracks) warned of environmental collapse in the bleakest terms on her recent album Hopelessness, Lopatin seems more awestruck than alarmed about humanity’s spectacular own goal. He wrings every ounce of emotional resonance from these abstract arrangements, and there is something deeply human about his ability to grasp the sublime in our moment of implosion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dcc75fb6ac94d5032c7c17b0a15a5e8f67886dc/0_134_1655_992/master/1655.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf2ea10ab9fb841853032212f7366556","title":"david davis resigns as brexit secretary reports say","story":"Secretary of state’s resignation followed by two other Brexit ministers, forcing a reshuffleDavid Davis has resigned as Brexit secretary, shattering the hard-won consensus around Theresa May’s Chequers deal and plunging her government into crisis.His resignation was swiftly followed by that of fellow Department for Exiting the EU minister Steve Baker. It forces May to reshuffle her government, at the same time as trying to convince backbenchers to support her plan.Davis sent a bluntly worded resignation letter to the prime minister, saying he would not be a “reluctant conscript” to the plan agreed at Chequers, which he said was “certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense”.Davis has told friends he cannot live with the soft Brexit stance agreed between ministers on Friday, which proposes a “UK-EU free trade area”, governed by a “common rule book”.Davis is said to have been “livid” about hostile briefing from senior figures in Downing Street about how Brexiters would be treated at Chequers – including suggestions they would be given the number of a local taxi firm if they chose to resign.May will now have to confront furious pro-Brexit MPs in parliament on Monday, knowing she has lost the backing of one of the leavers’ champions in government.Downing Street was publicly bullish on Monday, with a source saying the mini-reshuffle to replace Davis and Baker would begin from 9am. The source said: “We have a plan agreed at Chequers, as the PM says in her letter to David Davis, and we are moving forward.”The prime minister is facing a growing backlash from the pro-Brexit wing of her party, with MPs warning they are prepared to trigger a leadership contest.If at least 48 MPs send letters to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the powerful backbench 1922 Committee, he would have to call a vote of no confidence – though many of May’s supporters in the parliamentary party believe she could win it.Dozens of Tory MPs have attended emergency briefings in Downing Street since the Chequers summit on Friday, at which Boris Johnson said that colleagues would be “polishing a turd” if they tried to defend the plans to the party and public.The pro-Brexit Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns said it was time for May to be replaced. “Honestly, I think yes,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“The time has come that we need a Brexiteer prime minister, really – somebody who clearly believes in Brexit and is really prepared to deliver what the people voted for.”Her fellow Tory MPs “need to think long and hard over the next few days”, Jenkyns added.Davis had clashed with May on several occasions in recent weeks, including over when the long-awaited white paper setting out the government’s Brexit position should be published.He would prefer a much looser, Canada-style relationship with the EU27 after Brexit — a proposal rejected by the cabinet on Friday.In her reply to Davis’s resignation letter, the prime minister emphasised he had quit “when we are only eight months from the date set in law” for the UK to leave the EU. She rejected his characterisation that the policy agreed at Chequers on Friday would not bring powers back from Brussels to Britain.He told Reuters the resignation was “crucially important” because it showed the extent of concerns about the Chequers agreement. “If the Brexit secretary could not support them they cannot genuinely be delivering Brexit,” he said.The pro-Brexit MP earlier wrote in the Daily : “If the proposals are as they currently appear, I will vote against them, and others may well do the same.”Labour capitalised on the turmoil in Tory ranks. Jeremy Corbyn questioned whether May could still “cling on” to power, while the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, released a tally of Tory resignations since autumn.Before Sunday night’s ructions, May was set to tell the Commons: “In the two years since the referendum result we have had a spirited national debate, with robust views echoing round the cabinet table as they have on breakfast tables up and down our country. Over that time, I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit.”The prime minister also plans a fresh round of high-level diplomacy this week, in a bid to persuade the EU27 not to reject her plan outright.She is expected to talk directly to European leaders including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron“Our message now is to the other side, to Europe, that it’s time to get serious and sit down and talk about it,” she said on Sunday. “It’s now for Europe to be prepared to sit down and move the pace of negotiations on and talk about it seriously and address what we’ve put forward.”Some pro-Brexit MPs fear the prime minister’s plan will be regarded as an opening salvo by Brussels and she will be forced to make further concessions, possibly on free movement, before the next crunch summit in October.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has said the EU is ready to adapt its offer should the UK’s red lines change. However, May has agreed to ramp up preparations for a “no deal” Brexit in case Brussels – which described her previous customs proposals as “magical thinking” – rejects them.One senior Tory said that the government would have to take “a couple more steps” towards the EU’s position before a final deal was struck, even if it meant Brexiters swallowing more bitter pills. “Behind the scenes there’s a recognition that there needs to be a bit more movement on both sides,” he said.However, a No 10 source said: “Yes it’s a negotiation, but this isn’t about making concessions, this is about challenging the EU. It’s a good, pragmatic, workable solution that benefits all our economies and also our citizens. It’s time for Europe to get serious.”However, May will need to get her proposals past the party first. She will make a statement to the Commons on Monday before facing a fractious meeting of the backbench 1922 committee in the evening.Michael Gove, who is understood to have been instrumental in getting the leave-supporting cabinet on board with the proposals, urged pro-Brexit MPs to rally behind May on Sunday.The leading Brexiter said the deal the prime minister achieved at Chequers was not everything he had hoped for, but it honoured the result of the referendum and the cabinet was behind it, meaning that collective responsibility would prevail.“Those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the prime minister in order to negotiate that deal,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.“I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t make perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the cabinet.“We achieved all of the things that we campaigned for in order to ensure we could leave the EU, but we also do so in a way which respects some of the wishes and some of the concerns of some of my colleagues that voted remain.”One senior pro-Brexit source told the : “It’s terminal. We think this is going to lead to a bigger split than Maastricht, on a more serious issue, with a smaller majority, and it’s not Tony Blair that lies on the other side of all of this, it’s Jeremy Corbyn. We think it’s an absolute disaster.”Most remain-supporting MPs welcomed the proposals as a sensible starting point, adding that the “devil was in the detail” of the Brexit white paper, although former minister Phillip Lee, who quit over Brexit, said it represented an attempt to find the “least worst” option that was not in the best interests of the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bc315037910d71f11d75b04fa1e5d8aa13718e0/841_206_1277_766/master/1277.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=879e5b48a1bc381747897aa1dfa7ac66","title":"dominic raab appointed new brexit secretary in uk cabinet reshuffle","story":"Dominic Raab, a Brexit-supporting minister, has been promoted to replace David Davis as Brexit secretary, No 10 has announced.Raab was previously housing minister and replaces Davis, who resigned late on Sunday night saying he could no longer support the government’s Brexit policy announced at Chequers last week.Other names that had been canvassed for the appointment included Michael Gove, the environment secretary, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, and Chris Grayling, the transport secretary and a May loyalist. Raab’s appointment was welcomed by one of the cabinet’s most committed Brexiters, Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary. The prime minister is battling to contain a revolt by Brexiters in the Conservative party who are unhappy with the declaration on Friday, in which May signed her cabinet up to a UK-EU free-trade area under a “common rule book” that will match EU standards on food and goods.May has two vacancies to fill: Raab’s job at housing, and that of Steve Baker, the junior Brexit minister who also quit overnightA clearly angry Baker said he was unhappy with the way No 10 had tried to bully cabinet ministers into supporting May’s plan last week, with a briefing that ministers resigning at Chequers would have to find their own way home. Baker told the BBC’s Daily Politics he was unhappy with “childish nonsense from No 10” and “furious at the childishness of the briefing”.May is due to give a statement to the House of Commons on Monday afternoon and meet Tory backbenchers on the 1922 Committee in the early evening. If 48 Conservative MPs send letters to the chairman of the committee, Graham Brady, May will face a vote of no confidence in her leadership.Brady declined to comment on whether he had received any letters calling for a no confidence vote. He said no comment would be made unless and until 48 letters were received.Raab was one of the first names mentioned when sources briefed ahead of the Chequers meeting that a “talented new generation” of MPs was ready to replace cabinet ministers if they resigned. The chief whip, Julian Smith, is said to have had a meeting with Raab before the summit.There were complaints, however, about his short, six-month tenure as housing minister. It means his replacement will be the eighth person to hold the junior ministerial position since 2010, when the Conservatives returned to government.Suella Braverman, another junior Brexit minister, remains in post despite intense speculation that she had joined Davis in resigning.In an interview a fortnight ago, Raab said he supported a “full-fat Brexit” but “never said there weren’t risks with Brexit”.Raab’s name has been frequently mentioned by colleagues who believe the Conservative leadership should skip a generation. Although he is a Brexit supporter, he comes from the liberal tradition of the party. However, some of his past comments could come back to haunt him, including branding feminists “obnoxious bigots” in 2011.Raab was in the news earlier this year when it emerged one of his researchers was selling sex while working for him at the Commons. She also revealed he liked to have the same lunch every day, which she dubbed the “Dominic Raab special” – a chicken caesar and bacon baguette, a superfruit pot and a vitamin volcano smoothie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/694add64f6e47241d0586998dc614353af16e774/78_365_3345_2008/master/3345.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8041da7eaee0740ebbc2d67cfeee5a36","title":"he didnt want to be left holding the baby readers on davis resignation","story":"Here’s how you reacted to David Davis resigning as Brexit secretary due to disagreeing with the cabinet’s soft Brexit stance Davis has wanted an excuse to do this for months: to resign on “principle” instead of having to actually figure out how to proceed with wrecking the country. He almost had it last month and then at the last minute decided it wasn’t going to look “principled” enough.All his “activity” in “negotiating” with the EU has mostly involved booking flights and hotel rooms. Nothing else was achieved. Every direction he turned he got the same answer: Brexit is a man-made disaster, and all his pontification over the years was based on his own complete ignorance of basic facts about the EU. He spent most of the referendum campaign claiming the UK would negotiate inidually with Germany, France, etc.! He literally had no clue about even the basics of how the EU works.The irony is that he is now being described as “principled” for running away from the very process he fought for so long to set in motion, now he’s realised what a disaster it will inevitably be. danielearwickerDavis told us that a deal with the EU would be the “easiest ever”. In the two years he’s been in the job he has failed to agree anything. He promised the “row of the summer” over the scheduling of the talks last year and yet caved in on day one. From time to time he threatened to resign, most recently over the sacking of Damien Green and yet he didn’t now he has decided to go apparently whatever it was that he quite happily signed up to 48 hours ago is no longer acceptable, how can you deal with such people? He’s just another spoilt Tory brat with a sense of entitlement and belief in his abilities that doesn’t match his actual abilities. He has no credibility, he achieved nothing and no one will miss him. Addicks123Davis’s plan was always to leg it before Brexit became a reality. He knew, for all his bluster and bullshit, that a good Brexit was complete fiction and that he didn’t want to be left holding the baby. Davis spent four hours in discussions with Barnier in two years. Davis will be sorely missed. WeallneedThneadsI have read a lot of comments from remain supporters excited by Davis’s resignation. They believe that this will hasten the end of the foolishness that is Brexit. They are sadly mistaken as this event is more likely to lead to a hard Brexit than no Brexit and as such is part of the hard Brexiteers strategy. DonkeyWanLet’s face it. The real reason Davis resigned is that May marginalised him in the negotiations, for good reasons:• He didn’t do his homework on the impact assessments - which were so poor in the end• He showed up for a mere four hours of negotiating time - who can forget that perfect metaphor of a photo where the EU team arrive prepared with stacks of papers, UK pretty much empty-handed• He stated he didn’t really have to be clever to do his job - he isn’t, but he needed to be. But will the 1922 Committee, that May was already set to meet, win tonight’s battle? Leadership contest (not a GE) beckoning? LearningIsLifeLet’s be quite frank about this: Davis had no idea what he was doing, and events have given him the opportunity to run away under the supremely ironic guise of “man of principle”. Loathsome. titmussThe truth is Davis or anyone can never deliver a Brexit that is good for the UK.The reasons behind a Leave victory in the referendum can only be addressed with investment in those Brexit voting areas that have been battered by Tory austerity. It’s no good blaming the EU for problems made in Britain! lisalaneLooking about Davis’s change of demeanour over the months, this was coming, of course. It was clear that in the beginning, he had much more personal investment in how Brexit was to be negotiated, until near the end he clearly stopped caring. He knew that the Brexit negotiations were a train wreck, he would be unable to deliver any of the cake and unicorns, and the only question for him was when to jump ship in order to avoid personal responsibility for it.

(See 1.20pm.)But the Sun’s Matt Dathan says Boris Johnson is at the Cobra meeting.This is from the Times’ Sam Coates.And this is from my colleague Pippa Crerar.This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.Paul Goodman, the former Tory MP who now edits the ConservativeHome website, is a close friend of David Davis’s. He has written a revealing post about what drove Davis to resign which says that Davis first drafted a resignation letter at least a month ago. Here is how Goodman’s article starts.“It is possible that you are right and I am wrong,” David Davis writes to Theresa May in his resignation letter. The phrase was in a draft that I saw just over a month ago on the evening of June 6. Earlier in the day, he had been asked, after delivering a speech at RUSI, whether or not he would resign if the prime minister did not offer a date by which, in the event of a Brexit deal, the backstop arrangement over the UK-Ireland border would end. “That’s a question, I think, for the prime minister, to be honest,” he replied. This was less of an evasion than a confession. The Brexit secretary was trying to think through, using the logic tree methods that he loves to deploy, what to do for the best – and what the range of outcomes of a resignation might be. He hadn’t made up his mind what to do.Goodman also defends Davis from the charge of not spending enough time talking to his EU opposite number, Michel Barnier. Goodman says:Davis feared that if the Commons wasn’t presented with a detailed trade proposal in the autumn, it would vote the deal down, projecting the government and the country into unknown and unknowable political territory. Hence the urgent need to get a move on: get a proper customs policy – the stand-off over agreeing one was helping to tick the clock down – get a broader approach agreed and a white paper published get back round the negotiating table. That he had spent only four hours since Christmas negotiating with Michel Barnier had been well reported. The bleeding obvious had gained less traction: that, until or unless the government had first closed its isions, there wasn’t much to talk about.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative chair of the pro-Brexit European Research Group who seems to appear on TV roughly every ten minutes today, has spoken to BBC News and has a couple of extra things to say. Firstly, he has praised Dominic Raab’s appointment – but only if he has some power:Dominic is very able. But the key is – who will be doing these negotiations? Will it continue to be 10 Downing Street or will it be done by Dominic?Secondly, Rees-Mogg claimed May would be able to get a hard Brexit-friendly Canada-style deal through the Commons, as Tory MPs would support it if the only other option was a no-deal departure. “So the parliamentary arithmetic is much more on the prime minister’s side than some commentators seem to think,” he said.On Friday Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK, said that a free trade deal with the UK was a priority for the US. The pro-Brexit  event splashed on the news. The UK-US trade deal is totemic of some Brexiters to them, it represents the bright economic future the UK will have when it leaves the EU.But now the trade deal is in doubt. In an interview with Anna Foster on BBC Radio 5 Live, Johnson was asked about the status of the proposed deal in the light of what was agreed at Chequers. He replied:I think that there was a briefing that came out, as I understand it. It was very short, a couple of pages. This is a lot more complicated than a couple of pages. I would say that the bilateral agreement, whether we have one or not, is totally up in the air at this point.On the Daily Politics Andrea Leadsom, the Brexiter leader of the Commons, and the runner up behind Theresa May in the Conservative leadership contest, said that the UK will not offer EU nationals preferential access to the UK after Brexit. EU nationals would be in the same category as workers from a country like India, she suggested.Freedom of movement will end and there will be no special favours for EU citizens over anybody else with whom you might have visa reciprocity. So, for example, with India we have some special visa arrangements for high-skilled jobs and so on ...When asked specifically if EU nationals would get any preferential treatment, Leadsom said no.But this is quite different from Theresa May was saying on Saturday. In an interview with the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, May specifically did not rule out giving preferential treatment to EU nationals. She signalled that this was an option, and said that the government would decide later.In Brussels it is assumed that any deal giving the UK half-decent access to the single market would have to involve EU nationals getting preferential access to the UK (and certainly a better deal than workers from a country like India, where there are regular complaints about UK visa policies being too restrictive.)And the three-page government document (pdf) summarising May’s Brexit policy released on Friday night clearly implied that EU nationals would not be treated like all other non-UK nationals after Brexit. It said the government plan would:include a mobility framework so that UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other’s territories, and apply for study and work – similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.And here is Theresa May’s response to Steve Baker’s resignation letter. (See 12.05pm.)In it, May suggests that Baker could return to the government in the future. “I know that you have much left to contribute in the future,” May writes.Number 10 has released the resignation letter from Steve Baker, the Brexit minister.It is noticeably less critical than David Davis’s letter. (See 8.10am.)The Ukip leader Gerard Batten has written an open letter saying Theresa May should resign, my colleague Peter Walker reports.Margaritis Schinas, the European commission’s chief spokesman, told journalists at his morning briefing this morning that the resignation of David Davis would not affect the Brexit talks.Asked if it was a problem, he replied: “Not for us. We are here to work.”As the Press Association reports, Schinas said the commission did “not have a specific comment” about the resignation and refused to be drawn when asked to pay tribute to the outgoing cabinet minister. He said the commission was “available 247”, including over the summer, to discuss Brexit. He added:In this house it is very clear that our position has always been very cool. We avoided positioning the commission in terms of psychological elements - concern, enthusiasm, disappointment and so on. We are here to do a job.No 10 is in full, “Everything is completely normal” mode today, with any suggestions of future turmoil dismissed. Asked if Theresa May had spoken to Boris Johnson in the last 24 hours, the PM’s spokesman said: “Not that I am aware of.”On cabinet unity, the line was: The government agreed to the position on Friday. The prime minister looks forward to working with Dominic Raab on delivering Brexit... We’ve set out our position and it’s is now the EU’s turn to move.There was, however, no answer on whether May might have to give way some more in response to EU demands. The only response to such queries was: “That’s our position.”Some Tory Brexiters are telling journalist they don’t think Dominic Raab should have accepted David Davis’s job.This is from Sky’s Beth Rigby.And this is from the FT’s Laura Hughes.Jacob Rees-Mogg, head of hard Brexit backbench contingent, has said David Davis’s resignation will buoy feelings among Tory MPs who hope to object to the Chequers plan. He told Sky News:What he has done is crucially important. If David Davis was going along with what was agreed at Chequers it was quite hard for Brexiteers like me to point out what seemed to be its obvious failings, because if it was supported by the people most directly involved, surely they knew more than we did and there must be something in it that I had missed. It’s now quite clear that this is not the case.Rees-Mogg was scathing about May’s position, saying: The problem with Chequers is it’s not a U-turn, it’s a handbrake turn … Chequers is not really leaving the European Union ... She has advanced backwards. She has advanced not to have Brexit.Rees-Mogg also indicated he felt May had broken her word: “What you are saying is that the prime minister is inconsistent with her promises, and that’s a very bad position for a political party to be in.”Saying he wanted a Canada-style trade deal, Rees-Mogg said May might now be reliant on Labour votes to get her plan through the Commons:It’s fascinating that the prime minister’s chief of staff is going to brief Labour members, because I think that if the prime minister wants to get Chequers through she will be dependent on socialist votes. That’s always possible. It’s very, very difficult territory for somebody to run a government on the back of opposition support.Asked if he would go for the Tory leadership if May was ousted, Rees-Mogg gave something of a classic non-denial. He said:My sole ambition is that we get Brexit. It is not about me personally – that is a complete distraction.Pressed on it, he said only: “There isn’t a vacancy.”On the Daily Politics Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, said he was “absolutely furious” about the hostile briefing coming out of Number 10 that was aimed at Brexiters on Friday morning. He said it was “childish nonsense”.Asked who was responsible, Baker said he did not want to name name.Baker was referring to the ‘We’ve got the number for a taxi firm if they want to quit’ briefing that was around on Friday morning. The best account was in Jack Blanchard’s London Playbook briefing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa0fcef8f0945eab73876efd84d3a17c905779ea/268_381_4531_2718/master/4531.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c612055e3b06830bed67029a90e37e","title":"uk fertility regulator to issue new rules ivf add ons","story":"Patients will have to be told when fertility treatment extras are not likely to be effectiveIVF patients will need to be told when expensive “add-ons” to fertility treatments are not likely to be effective, under new rules due to be issued to clinics later this year.The crackdown by the government’s fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, comes as an increasing number of clinics are charging patients top-up fees for experimental procedures that have not been tested in clinical trials, or have been shown to make no difference.Under a code of practice due to come into effect in October, subject to approval by the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the HFEA will require doctors to explain to patients whether there is any clinical evidence to support extra procedures being offered.Sally Cheshire, the regulator’s chairwoman, said the move was prompted by a recent surge in the variety of treatments on offer and the number of clinics offering them.“Clinics tell us it’s due to patient pressure,” she said. “We’re saying clinics need to be robust and ethical in what they offer, particularly if they’re asking patients to pay for those treatments.”“We know that some patients are being asked to pay double or triple that, or even £20,000 for a cycle, and there isn’t anything particularly different as far as we’re concerned,” said Cheshire. “There’s no effective evidence that these treatments work, and some of them may even be potentially harmful for some patients, which clearly isn’t ethical.”Cheshire singled out reproductive immunology treatments that suppress the mother’s immune system as being of particular concern. There is no good evidence these drugs improve pregnancy rates, and side effects can include chronic infections, septicaemia and severe allergic reactions. “When you are injecting immunosuppressant drugs into your body, it’s not a good thing,” she said.Another add-on offered by some fertility clinics is assisted hatching. It involves using acid, a laser, or other tool to thin the protein coating from which an embryo must break out before it can implant in the womb. The procedure, which costs £400-£500, has not been shown to improve pregnancy rates, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.Other treatments that have been questioned cost more. For £750, time-lapse imaging will track the day-to-day development of IVF embryos under a microscope to help doctors select the ones most likely to lead to a baby. But again, there is no good evidence it increases live birth rates. Jane Stewart, the chairwoman of the British Fertility Society and a consultant in reproductive medicine and gynaecology at Newcastle fertility centre, said: “Over and over again we see new ideas being brought in without the evidence it needs.“A lot of the time, patients are shopping around for what they think they need and that’s wrong, medicine is not like that.”According to a traffic light designation by the HFEA’s scientific committee, none of the 10 most commonly offered add-ons is backed by robust evidence to show an improvement in the success rates of treatment. Earlier this week, a large study concluded an add-on called an endometrial scratch does not improve the chances of a live birth. “The difficulty I have is that it becomes a commercial thing,” said Stewart. “In the clinic, a patient might be told about other treatments and say ‘OK, I’ll have that too’. It becomes a discussion not about the medical problem, but rather if you can afford this or that, then it might be what makes the difference.”The situation can be made worse when people do not get a proper consultation before they embark on fertility treatment. Many couples who are referred for fertility tests will not need IVF, but at private clinics the conversation may move quickly to when IVF will be given and with what extras.Prof Geeta Nargund, a senior consultant at St George’s Hospital in London and the medical director of Create Fertility, said she had previously raised concerns with health commissioners about clinics that were promoting add-ons to NHS patients.She welcomed the introduction of tighter rules, but said the HFEA should also require clinics to provide data on which procedures were being offered to each patient and make it clear what the sanctions would be for clinics that failed to comply with the guidelines. Prof Nick Macklon, the medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said many patients requested extra tests and procedures they have read about.“I spend quite a lot of my time putting patients off this and that, and my colleagues do too,” he said. “I think just to say it’s all nonsense and they’re all cowboys is not the case. Doctors are also looking for therapies that can help people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec4897cb9f037a9aeeb9a3db6cfe917ba0c1cc02/225_367_3051_1830/master/3051.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f9623b01593be93173a4a19418345a4","title":"dave brailsford sky cycling","story":"• Brailsford: ‘He has got local French mayor kind of mentality’• President of cycling’s governing body has criticised Team SkyDave Brailsford has launched a stinging attack on the recently elected president of world cycling’s governing body, the Frenchman David Lappartient, accusing him of having a “French mayor” mentality.“I gave him the benefit of the doubt when he started,” the Team Sky principal said of the UCI president. “I\u0026nbspthought, ‘OK, he is new to the job, he obviously doesn’t quite understand the responsibilities of a presidential role.’ I think he has still got the local French mayor kind of mentality.”Ironically Lappartient has in fact been the mayor of Sarzeau – population 6,143, in Brittany – which is hosting the finish of the fourth stage on Tuesday, for a decade.The war of words between the men has escalated since the publication of the highly critical DCMS select committee anti-doping report in March, following which Lappartient said that if Team Sky was “using substances to increase performances, this is exactly what is cheating”.Brailsford’s criticism of the UCI president come in the wake of comments Lappartient made at the end of last week when he appeared to suggest that Chris Froome had been cleared of any wrongdoing by Wada and the UCI because of his wealth.“Froome had more financial support to find good experts,” Lappartient said. Speaking to the  on Saturday the Frenchman reiterated that view saying: “It’s not just in cycling, that’s global justice. That’s democracy, you can’t prevent somebody from spending money on legal defence by capping it.”But Brailsford dismissed Lappartient’s position as a “cop-out”. Brailsford added: “Justice is justice and whether you are in the smallest team in the professional peloton or the biggest one, the justice and the rules that apply to you should be the same and fair. There should be no issue whatsoever there.“If you want to be the president of an international federation then protect everybody in that international community,” Brailsford said. “Don’t take a French angle or a nationalistic view on the international community. Protect the international community with no bias.“And I think he is still learning that really. The quicker he can get there, and learn what a president of an international federation’s responsibilities are, the better it will be for everybody. But he has got some work to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55fdab3da7d1abfda41c40a21009c4dcff16a8a9/0_119_3472_2084/master/3472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7995c460b4f26f68da5874ef3ef50815","title":"travis pastrana evel knievel jumps motorcycle las vegas","story":"Travis Pastrana succeeded in repeating three of Evel Knievel’s most famous motorcycle jumps on Sunday night.Donning his own Knievel-like costume, Pastrana used an Indian Scout FTR750 to jump 143 feet to clear 52 crushed cars, 192 feet over 16 Greyhound buses and concluded by jumping 149 feet to clear the fountains at Caesars Palace.Pastrana, who is nearing the end of an impressive career as a stunt showman and professional motorsports competitor, admitted he was nervous leading up to the event, which began in an empty lot behind off Las Vegas’s famous Strip.“This is all about\u0026nbspEvel, and the coolest thing about this whole thing, all of\u0026nbspEvel’s family is out here,” said Pastrana, whose outfit included a white jumpsuit with the blue V and white stars, a cape and high heel dress boots. “This is the home of the most iconic jump, one of the most iconic events that has ever gone down. And to end at Caesars Palace, to have a chance to jump the fountain.\u0026nbsp It’s not the longest jump but it’s definitely the hardest.”After his first two jumps over the cars and buses, Pastrana had a police escort while riding the same motorcycle along Las Vegas Boulevard all while popping wheelies and stopping to high-five and shake hands with fans.“To be able to get a police escort on the Las Vegas Strip, I mean c’mon,” said Pastrana, 34, who cleared the fountains over 50 years after Knievel\u0026nbspfamously crashed while attempting the same feat.Pastrana jumped the fountain in the opposite direction Knievel did. With the area much more built out than it was on New Year’s Eve in 1967, Pastrana had less space for his approach, leaving him a shorter distance to reach approximately 70 miles per hour before takeoff.Knievel, who died in 2007 aged 69, came up short on his attempt at jumping the fountain, hitting the knuckle just before the landing ramp and losing control. He flew head first over the handlebars and tumbled along the pavement, crushing his pelvis and fracturing several other bones in the process.Knievel jumped over 50 crushed cars at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 1973, and 14 Greyhound buses in 1975 at Ohio’s Kings Island amusement park.

Geraint Thomas is even one second ahead of them after he collected one second of bonification at the bonus point of stage 2. “Hot favourites Team Sky have to beat Bora-Hansgrohe by fifteen seconds to bring the Welshman in the yellow jersey. Their challengers are BMC whose highest ranked rider is Greg Van Avermaet with a deficit of sixteen seconds from Peter Sagan.”Stage two: Peter Sagan sprinted to victory in La Roche-sur-Yon and took the yellow jersey in yesterday’s stage, which was marred by a crash on the final bend. Here’s Jeremy Whittle’s report ...Ten years after hosting an inidual time trial won by Stefan Schumacher, Cholet is the venue for a team version of the Race of Truth in the third stage of this year’s Tour. Here’s William Fotheringham’s take on today’s route from our stage-by-stage guide to this year’s race.“This is the first chance for gaps to open – particularly if it’s breezy or wet – and all eyes will be on Team Sky, who have yet to win a Tour team time trial. It’s not a straightforward blast, peppered with corners and with two little hills after halfway to put any strugglers under pressure.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8384fc9c67ab6e546d3ded5a76c0e749de092ca/0_479_7114_4269/master/7114.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cefa84bb0c4bf01e3de955995e89105f","title":"5 of the best urban days out england kayaking yoga paddleboard","story":"Experience a burst of activity or just some scenic calm with these city-based trips, featuring a kayaking tour of Tyne bridges to yoga on a paddleboardFamed for their seven bridges ning the Tyne Gorge, the twin cities of Newcastle and Gateshead are best experienced from the water.

Eldorado was meant to be the new EastEnders – but 25 years since it was axed, it’s still a byword for disasterKai Maurer didn’t know that bleaching his hair would change his life. It was 1992 and the 18-year-old German was bumming around in southern Spain, searching for sun and all the other Ss. He dyed his long brown hair blond for a bet.Next thing he knew, a British TV production was looking to cast a young, blond German for some filming they were doing in the area. Kai went along. He hadn’t really done any acting before, but he’d played the trumpet as a kid, he’d been on a stage. And the audition went well, he got the part. In Eldorado. “I had no idea what anyone was talking about,” Maurer tells me today, over a quarter of a century on. “They were all going, ‘This is for the BBC, it’s going to be big like EastEnders, do you have any inkling how big?’ And I said, ‘No idea. I don’t even know what the BBC is.’”Eldorado’s final episode was broadcast 25 years ago this week. Today the soap opera, said to have cost the BBC £10m, is synonymous with extravagant fiasco. As in, be careful, it could all go Eldorado or we might have an Eldorado on our hands. The BBC hasn’t commissioned an open-ended soap since.It started so hopefully. The early 90s saw peak ratings cold war between the superpowers. ITV had Coronation Street and Emmerdale, the BBC just EastEnders. With the government breathing down its neck, the Beeb needed to add a cruise missile to its arsenal, in order to increase its market share, justify the licence fee, and perhaps its very existence. There was a competition, and a winner: EastEnders creator Tony Holland’s idea about expat Brits living in Spain. It had the key ingredients of a good soap: a sense of real community, of claustrophobia and isolation. There would be Germans and Scandinavians around the place, but it would centre on the Brits who brought their country with them. Little England was the original name. Tony Jordan, then a rookie writer on EastEnders, was brought in by Holland: he wrote Eldorado’s very first episode. Jordan remembers the hype growing until “at some point the commercial people started thinking, ‘Hang on, we’re part of Europe now, this could be the first Eurosoap, that could play not just in the UK but all over Europe.’ It became bastardised, those other nationalities were not on the periphery, they were in the centre. You had all these people tying themselves in knots in this kind of Europudding.”Jordan also talks about the terrible rush. Transmission was dragged forward to throw a curveball at ITV. The entire village they were building in Spain at a cost of £2m was hardly ready casting was rushed. As well as established actors, unknowns were hired – people like Kai Maurer. It couldn’t be called Little England any more, so it became Eldorado. The first episode aired on 6 July 1992 – and it was awful.The critics hated it. ’s Nancy Banks-Smith said it had “the look of a situation comedy whose laughter track has been lost” and wished for a tidal wave to wash the whole thing away. The punters hated it, too. The first episode had an audience appreciation index of 37, among the worst in memory. They’d hoped for 10 million viewers, but by the end of the first month the Friday episode (Eldorado originally went out three times a week) got just 2.8 million – fewer than Panorama. A year later the show that was supposed to save the Beeb’s ass was axed. Brake thinks the show was too ambitious, that it should have started more gently. But soon it was going out five times a week. “We were told we would have siestas in the afternoon, because we were terribly hot, and I remember one cameraman falling over because they were working so hard in the great heat.”She wasn’t convinced by the policy of hiring unknowns. “Some of the casting was unbelievably bad, considering how much talent we have in this country,” she says. Brake, who had worked with the RSC alongside Judi Dench and Ian Richardson, was now starring with Kai the German beach bum. Hey, he had been on stage, too, remember, even if it was only to blow his trumpet. Actually, if you look back at Eldorado now Kai is by no means the worst.Kai’s lines were in English. Some of the other actors spoke their own languages – Spanish, Swedish, Danish – which might have been authentic but also meant that most viewers didn’t know what the hell they were saying. Subtitles were added later, though a primetime popular audience wasn’t ready for them in the early 90s. “I think it may well have been ahead of its time,” says Kai. “Multiculturalism, there you have it, God knows how many different European nationalities under one roof.”Even the English bits weren’t always easy to understand – the sound quality was terrible. It turned out that a very expensive, purpose-built Spanish village had very echoey acoustics. The set still stands on the Costa Del Sol it’s used for paintballing. In spite of the stick it was getting, everyone I speak to who worked on it has fond memories of Eldorado. It might have been hard work, and not very good, but it was a lot of fun. Derek Martin, who played a gangster with a yacht, says the drive to work from his villa in the village of Mijas to the set, was the best he’s ever done. “We were all sad that it packed in,” he says. “The reason was because Mr Alan Yentob went to BBC One. If it had failed, it would’ve been his baby. But at the time it was shut down, it was getting eight million viewers. That should’ve been a licence to go again.”Eight million in 1993, when most viewers had a choice of four channels, wasn’t as many as eight million is today, but it’s a lot more than 2.8 million. A new producer had been brought in, new actors hired, some of the worst non-actors fired Eldorado had, to some extent, been turned around. Now it wasn’t really really bad, just not very good. And not very good wasn’t good enough for the new head of BBC One.So what does Yentob, who inherited Eldorado from his predecessor Jonathan Powell, have to say for himself? “There had been chaos up there, problems on the set, a change of producer, lots of things weren’t working. We saw costs not coming down, and I had other things in mind that would have been difficult to achieve given the investment in Eldorado.” Plus it was awful? “It was, and there you are. But when people are losing their jobs, it’s difficult to be that negative. I gave it a bit of a chance for a few weeks, looked at whether it was potentially going to get better. But, despite the fact it had a good producer, she couldn’t rehabilitate it, so, yes, I cancelled it.” Nancy’s tidal wave had finally arrived, in the form of Alan Yentob. Protests ensued from angry fans. “The stick has not stopped,” Yentob says. “People have been campaigning for it to be revived for such a long time. I’m sure people are sticking pins into pictures of me day and night. Which they are anyway.”Martin, who went on to play Charlie Slater in EastEnders, has heard rumours of an Eldorado reprisal. Now 85, would he go back? “Right now, this minute.”For Brake, just 76, it might not have been the long-term, mortgage-busting job she’d hoped it was going to be. “I think it was the end of my career really. Everything I’m proud of I did before.” But she’s not bitter it worked out well for her personally. If she’d stayed in Spain, she wouldn’t have met her husband. As for Maurer, it was something of a beginning. “I did it the wrong way round didn’t I?” he laughs. “I then went to the UK and I studied acting. I thought, ‘Right, I’m going to see what this is all about, see if I can improve anything.’ What has improved is I don’t sound German any more.”Not as German anyway. The acting lasted a while, but he found the only parts he was getting were comedy Germans or Nazis. He got tired of trying to impress casting directors: it was never as easy as it was that first time in Spain. He stayed in Britain, but changed career. Twenty-five years after the sun went down on Eldorado, Kai’s a flying instructor at Rochester airport, overlooking the River Medway in Kent.Oh and Jordan, who went on to become one of the biggest names in television writing, thinks it would be a good idea to bring it back. “Drama is a very crowded space,” he says. “We’re constantly looking for things that will make a noise, bring in an audience. If there was a broadcaster brave enough and smart enough to do a version of Eldorado, they’d get an immediate audience, though to keep them they’d have to give them a good show.” Over to you, broadcasters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b37a7f80ea04290d62acc1837f5ff1f36fe96e9c/0_69_1987_1192/master/1987.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ba33520ee3cbd2a0e983157ff6d77d6","title":"too much tv mr mercedes future man sweetbitter startup hap leonard","story":"Mr Mercedes, Future Man, Sweetbitter and StartUp – all real TV shows, all largely unwatched and unloved.

Mr Mercedes, remember? It’s about a cat-and-mouse game between a psychopath and a retired detective. David E Kelly is the showrunner. Brendan Gleeson is in it. Anyone? Mr Mercedes? Anyone? No?Oh, fine. I’ve never heard of Mr Mercedes either. And that’s ever so slightly worrying, because the whole thing drips with talent. Brendan Gleeson is a big deal, and so is David E Kelly. Stephen King you might also have heard of. On paper, Mr Mercedes should be enormous. If it was made five years ago it would have been enormous. But now that we’re all drowning in more TV than we could ever possibly watch, it has barely left a dent.But Mr Mercedes isn’t the only theoretically big show to get lost in the churn. Here are eight more real shows that really exist. Future Man is about a janitor who travels through time trying to save the world from aliens, kind of like Doctor Who if Doctor Who was so aggressively obscure that someone took up an entire paragraph in a newspaper article trying to convince people that it really existed.

It has just been renewed for a third series, even though literally nobody in the entire world has ever even heard of it. Worse, I just watched some of StartUp out of morbid curiosity, and discovered that Martin Freeman is barely even in it.James Purefoy plays Hap Collins, an ex-con with a femme fatale ex-wife and an angry gay best friend.

Nurses say they are overworked and underpaid, and hospitals are chronically understaffed.Nurses have not gone on strike in New Zealand for 30 years. Minister for health David Clark said the nurses’ discontent had been brewing after nine years of neglect under the previous, National government. “Their frustration is understandable ... I think everyone agrees nurses should be paid more than they are now, but it takes more than one pay round to address nine years of neglect.“We have a fiscal limit, and we’ve put out there the best offer we could put out there.”Primary school teachers have also voted overwhelmingly to strike for half a day on 15 August, their first strike action in more than 24 years. Other groups to strike since the Labour-led government took over in October last year include cinema workers, fast-food workers, and bus drivers. Unite union senior organiser Joe Carolan said the wave of strikes are “unprecedented”, and that workers felt emboldened under the new government and the “swing to the left”. Carolan said concerns the strikes could destabilise the government were not justified.“In the public sector ... some voices are saying this is not the right time to strike as we have a friendly government. So you wonder - when is the right time?” he said.The opposition National party has criticised the government for failing to listen to nurses’ concerns, and say they have a duty to meet the “hugely raised expectations” of workers under their government. There is a fear in some quarters that the wave of strikes was affecting business confidence, which hit a seven-year low in June.In the last significant win for unions, the New Zealand government banned zero-hour contracts in 2016, a bill supported by political parties across the spectrum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/809417b64e8b2fcb902cbcace17efdca643d59c2/7_510_3913_2349/master/3913.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71f38f1c665d5ccc86af82144824a2ad","title":"pride in london in pictures","story":"Huge crowds enjoy the sun and the parade at the city’s annual LGBT Pride celebration."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Food Safety Authority issued eight closure orders to restaurants and cafes in JunePatrick O\u0026rsquoConnor (24) was attacked while socialising in Fitzgerald\u0026rsquos bar on SaturdayRoyal newlyweds to visit Croke Park, Trinity College and Famine MemorialNovember strike for Section 39 workers on the way unless pay talks progressAdjournment to allow for analysis of electronic data from inquiry into death of Colm FoxAction, to begin on July 24th, is part of dispute about deduction of union dues at sourceDavid Davis says Chequers deal means UK will be giving too much away, too easily\u0026lsquoScattered showers\u0026rsquo forecasted this week will fall far below what is needed to restore water levelsJoe Lawlor died on Sunday after the car he was driving hit a tree in the village of PortroeTrade union Unite says archaeologists are earning close to the minimum wageIreland must not be perceived as being soft on large companies, warns EUNaughten to be pressured by families over home for adults with mental health issuesCoolquay locals say site is \u0026lsquohighly unsuitable\u0026rsquo as it is a flood plainLack of room in Central Mental Hospital means ill offenders in prison for long periodsWalk While You Can: Fr Tony Coote travelling Ireland to raise funds to tackle diseaseIHCA says system of consultants delivering services in public hospitals \u0026lsquoon a cliff edge\u0026rsquoTwo staff from each postprimary school to be trained in \u0026lsquoalertness\u0026rsquo programme"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3558391.1531129435!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dominic raab appointed brexit secretary after davis resigns","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit secretary David Davis who has resigned from the government. File photograph: Ian ForsythPA WireDominic Raab has been appointed as Brexit Secretary, Downing Street said, after David Davis and junior Brexit minister Steve Baker resigned on Sunday night.The prime minister is due to update the House of Commons this afternoon on the Brexit strategy agreed by the cabinet at Chequers last Friday and to address the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers this evening.In his letter of resignation overnight, Mr Davis told Theresa May the deal agreed at Chequers meant Britain was now unlikely to leave the customs union and the single market when it leaves the EU.Mr Davis said he was “very clear” on Friday that he did not back May’s Brexit plan and said he told the prime minister he would be the “odd man out” on it.Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Monday, Mr Davis said: “When we debated this at Cabinet on Friday my opening remark to Theresa was ‘prime minister, as you know I’m going to be the odd-man-out in this’. She knew this because I had written to her earlier in the week.“Cabinet collective responsibility applied so I didn’t say anything thereafter. That was because I was thinking about the consequences.“I took the view at the time this was not the best strategy, that there were better strategies available - we have been establishing them.“I thought it would be a risk at least of delivering a poor outcome. I was very clear on Friday and I took two days to think through some, for me, very important decisions.”He also said he believes Ms May is a “good prime minister” and insisted “oh yes, of course” she can survive as leader.In his letter of resignation, Mr Davis said: “In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real.“ As I said at Cabinet, the “common rule book” policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense. I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions,” he said.Ms May had been hoping to win over Brexiteers after a backlash against her plans for leaving the EU.Mr Davis, who signed up to the plan agreed by the cabinet at Chequers last Friday has left the cabinet with immediate effect.His exit may embolden Brexiteer backbenchers who have concerns about Mrs May’s leadership.The move, late last night, came just as Ms May faces a major test in the House of Commons on Monday and then a potentially stormy meeting of Tory MPs and peers.Ms May is expected to tell MPs that the strategy agreed at Chequers is the “right Brexit” for Britain.In her response, the prime minister said she disagreed with Mr Davis’s characterisation of the Chequers deal, which she described as a “precise, responsible and credible” approach to the negotiations.“I am sorry that the government will not have the benefit of your continued expertise and counsel as we secure this deal and complete the process of leaving the EU, but I would like to thank you warmly for everything you have done over the past two years as Secretary of State to shape our departure from the EU, and the new role the UK will forge on the world stage as an independent, self-governing nation once again,” she said.Last night British Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: “This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left. “He said Ms May was in office but not in power. “ She cannot deliver Brexit, and our country is at a complete standstill. We can’t go on like this. Britain needs a functioning government.”Reacting to news of Mr Davis’s resignation late last night, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “We’ll see how things develop. As far as I am concerned, when Theresa May speaks she speaks for the UK government and that’s the basis I’ll be working on.”Earlier last night, Mr Varadkar said the UK must be a full member of the European Single Market, or else stay out of it entirely, in response to Ms May’s latest Brexit plan.He gave a cautious welcome to the deal agreed by the British cabinet, which he hailed as a “real political success” for Ms May.In his first public comments since the UK cabinet agreed the new approach last Friday – which moves Britain towards a so-called soft Brexit – Mr Varadkar said he was more optimistic than before that an EU-UK exit deal could be struck by the end of the year.However, the Taoiseach said he had “some concerns about the workability of the UK’s customs” proposals and the plan’s effect on the integrity of the single market.The new approach envisages a new UK-EU customs area, although Britain could apply different tariffs from the EU.It would also align Britain to the European Single Market for goods, while moving away from it for services.Mr Varadkar was speaking after talks in Dublin Castle with Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian Chancellor, to coincide with Austria assuming the six- month presidency of the European Council.Both leaders stressed the integrity of the single market, which commits members to free movement of goods, services, capital and people.“The position from the EU, and a position I support, is that you are either in the single market or you’re not,” Mr Varadkar said.“The single market has four freedoms: of movement when it comes to goods when it comes to labour when it comes to services and when it comes to capital, and we’ve said in our guidelines that those are inisible.”While an exception could be made for the North, “an exception for the UK would be a very different order and the EU’s position is that the four freedoms with respect to the UK must go together,” he said. – Additional reporting: PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Speaking to Today, Ms Jenkyns said Mrs May’s time was up as prime minister and she wanted a Brexiteer to lead the country.“I think Theresa May’s premiership is over,” she said.“I want one who passionately believes in Brexit and will provide true leadership and a positive post-Brexit vision for our country,” she said.Opposition MPs were quick to raise the prospect of a general election as a result of the major blow for the prime minister.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows Theresa May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit.“With her government in chaos, if she clings on, it’s clear she’s more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.”Shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: “With a Prime Minister incapable of holding her ministerial team together \u0026amp with such instability in government it’s impossible to see how EU leaders could take Theresa May seriously in the next round of negotiations.“It’s time for her \u0026amp her party to put country before party \u0026amp go.”The DUP’s Sammy Wilson maintains that Ireland should be very concerned about the possibility of a no deal Brexit.“Your government should be very concerned. The country that will suffer the most in a no deal is Ireland,” he told RTE’s Morning Ireland.He said that “despite bullying by Leo Varadkar and Michel Barnier” a separate agreement for Northern Ireland will not be conceded.“The government made very clear that no back stop that separates Northern Ireland from the UK will be accepted.”The former DUP leader added that British Prime Minister Theresa May knows that support for her government from the DUP will depend on her maintaining that position “and not conceding one inch. That is a redline for us.”Seema Malhotra, who sits on the Commons Brexit Select Committee, tweeted: “Will there be a domino effect?“It’s now not inconceivable that May is gone within days or weeks, the Tories are plunged into disarray and a general election called.”Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: “David Davis resignation now shows the Tory party is in complete disarray and not governing in the national interest.“This nonsense cannot continue, even the Tory spin doctors cannot surely spin a positive message out of this debacle, it’s time for the Tories to go #ToryFail”Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry tweeted: “Government resignations since autumn: 1 November 2017 — Fallon 8 November 2017 — Patel 20 December 2017 - Green 29 April 2018 — Rudd 8 January 2018 — Greening 8 July 2018 — Davis There have been six resignations in 249 days. That’s one every six weeks.”The Liberal Democrats, who back a second referendum on Brexit, said on Twitter: “The resignation of David Davis is yet more evidence of the chaos of this Tory Brexit. You deserve the final say on this shambolic Brexit with the chance to stay in the EU.”Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: “The #chequers unity didn’t last long. This UK government is in utter chaos and ebbing authority by the day. What a shambles.”Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Commons leader, tweeted: “It took the Tories two years to come up with a proposal and two days for it to fall apart!”Mr Davis’s departure was met with dismay from business leaders who had called for greater certainty over the Brexit process.Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said there had been “real rays of light” in the Cabinet agreement on Friday and described the resignation as a “blow”.She told Today: “This is a blow. One of the things that business welcomed on Friday was finally cabinet unity.“That inability to take decisions over several months had become a huge challenge in terms of uncertainty.”– PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3558784.1531124733!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us opposition to breastfeeding motion stuns world health officials","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA young mother breastfeeding her infant daughter. Photograph: Getty ImagesiStockphotoA resolution to encourage breastfeeding was expected to be approved quickly and easily by the hundreds of government delegates who gathered this spring in Geneva for the United Nations-affiliated World Health Assembly. Based on decades of research, the resolution says that mother’s milk is healthiest for children and countries should strive to limit the inaccurate or misleading marketing of breast milk substitutes. Then the US delegation, embracing the interests of infant formula manufacturers, upended the deliberations. American officials sought to water down the resolution by removing language that called on governments to “protect, promote and support breastfeeding” and another passage that called on policymakers to restrict the promotion of food products that many experts say can have deleterious effects on young children.When that failed, they turned to threats, according to diplomats and government officials who took part in the discussions. Ecuador, which had planned to introduce the measure, was the first to find itself in the cross hairs. The Americans were blunt: If Ecuador refused to drop the resolution, Washington would unleash punishing trade measures and withdraw crucial military aid. The Ecuadorean government quickly acquiesced. The showdown over the issue was recounted by more than a dozen participants from several countries, many of whom requested anonymity because they feared retaliation from the United States. Health advocates scrambled to find another sponsor for the resolution, but at least a dozen countries, most of them poor nations in Africa and Latin America, backed off, citing fears of retaliation, according to officials from Uruguay, Mexico and the United States.“We were astonished, appalled and also saddened,” said Patti Rundall, policy director of the British advocacy group Baby Milk Action, who has attended meetings of the assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organisation, since the late 1980s.“What happened was tantamount to blackmail, with the US holding the world hostage and trying to overturn nearly 40 years of consensus on the best way to protect infant and young child health,” she said. In the end, the Americans’ efforts were mostly unsuccessful. It was the Russians who ultimately stepped in to introduce the measure – and the Americans did not threaten them. The State Department declined to respond to questions, saying it could not discuss private diplomatic conversations. The US Department of Health and Human Services, the lead agency in the effort to modify the resolution, explained the decision to contest the resolution’s wording but said HHS was not involved in threatening Ecuador.“The resolution as originally drafted placed unnecessary hurdles for mothers seeking to provide nutrition to their children,” an HHS spokesman said in an email. “We recognise not all women are able to breastfeed for a variety of reasons. These women should have the choice and access to alternatives for the health of their babies, and not be stigmatised for the ways in which they are able to do so.” The spokesman asked to remain anonymous in order to speak more freely.Although lobbyists from the baby food industry attended the meetings in Geneva, health advocates said they saw no direct evidence that they played a role in Washington’s strong-arm tactics. The €60 billion industry, which is dominated by a handful of US and European companies, has seen sales flatten in wealthy countries in recent years, as more women embrace breastfeeding. Overall, global sales are expected to rise by 4 per cent in 2018, according to Euromonitor, with most of that growth occurring in developing nations.The intensity of the administration’s opposition to the breastfeeding resolution stunned public health officials and foreign diplomats, who described it as a marked contrast to the Obama administration, which largely supported the WHO’s long-standing policy of encouraging breastfeeding.During the deliberations, some American delegates even suggested the United States might cut its contribution to the WHO, several negotiators said. Washington is the single largest contributor to the health organisation, providing $845 million (€720 million), or roughly 15 per cent of its budget, last year. The confrontation was the latest example of the Trump administration siding with corporate interests on numerous public health and environmental issues. In talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Americans have been pushing for language that would limit the ability of Canada, Mexico and the United States to put warning labels on junk food and sugary beverages, according to a draft of the proposal reviewed by the New York Times.During the same Geneva meeting where the breastfeeding resolution was debated, the United States succeeded in removing statements supporting soda taxes from a document that advises countries grappling with soaring rates of obesity. The Americans also sought, unsuccessfully, to thwart a WHO effort aimed at helping poor countries obtain access to lifesaving medicines. Washington, supporting the pharmaceutical industry, has long resisted calls to modify patent laws as a way of increasing drug availability in the developing world, but health advocates say the Trump administration has ratcheted up its opposition to such efforts.The delegation’s actions in Geneva are in keeping with the tactics of an administration that has been upending alliances and long-established practices across a range of multilateral organisations, from the Paris climate accord to the Iran nuclear deal to Nafta. Ilona Kickbusch, director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, said there was a growing fear that the Trump administration could cause lasting damage to international health institutions like the WHO that have been vital in containing epidemics like Ebola and the rising death toll from diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the developing world.“It’s making everyone very nervous, because if you can’t agree on health multilateralism, what kind of multilateralism can you agree on?” Kickbusch asked. A Russian delegate said the decision to introduce the breastfeeding resolution was a matter of principle. “We’re not trying to be a hero here, but we feel that it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world,” said the delegate, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media.He said the United States did not directly pressure Moscow to back away from the measure. Nevertheless, the US delegation sought to wear down the other participants through procedural manoeuvres in a series of meetings that stretched on for two days, an unexpectedly long period.In the end, the United States was largely unsuccessful. The final resolution preserved most of the original wording, though American negotiators did get language removed that called on the WHO to provide technical support to member states seeking to halt “inappropriate promotion of foods for infants and young children”.The United States also insisted that the words “evidence-based” accompany references to long-established initiatives that promote breastfeeding, which critics described as a ploy that could be used to undermine programmes that provide parents with feeding advice and support.Elisabeth Sterken, director of the Infant Feeding Action Coalition in Canada, said four decades of research have established the importance of breast milk, which provides essential nutrients as well as hormones and antibodies that protect newborns against infectious disease.A 2016 study in the Lancet found that universal breastfeeding would prevent 800,000 child deaths a year across the globe and yield €250 billion in savings from reduced health care costs and improved economic outcomes for those reared on breast milk.Scientists are loath to carry out double-blind studies that would provide one group with breast milk and another with breast milk substitutes. “This kind of ‘evidence-based’ research would be ethically and morally unacceptable,” Sterken said.Abbott Laboratories, the Chicago-based company that is one of the biggest players in the $70 billion baby food market, declined to comment. Nestlé, the Switzerland-based food giant with significant operations in the United States, sought to distance itself from the threats against Ecuador and said the company would continue to support the international code on the marketing of breast milk substitutes, which calls on governments to regulate the inappropriate promotion of such products and to encourage breastfeeding.In addition to the trade threats, Todd C Chapman, the US ambassador to Ecuador, suggested in meetings with officials in Quito, the Ecuadorean capital, that the Trump administration might also retaliate by withdrawing the military assistance it has been providing in northern Ecuador, a region wracked by violence spilling across the border from Colombia, according to an Ecuadorean government official who took part in the meeting.The US Embassy in Quito declined to make Chapman available for an interview. “We were shocked because we didn’t understand how such a small matter like breastfeeding could provoke such a dramatic response,” said the Ecuadorean official, who asked not to be identified because she was afraid of losing her job. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"child could have left without mother","story":"digitalservices@telegraphdigitalservices@telegraphEight days after giving birth Nina Khaira would be back in hospital: this time fighting for her life.Nina – a 38-year-old dentist from Cornwall – had contracted sepsis, triggered by a urinary tract infection that spread to her blood.The strain of bacteria responsible – ESBL E. coli – was resistant to most antibiotics, including those her GP had prescribed.Dr Nina Khaira was back in hospital just eight days after giving birth to her daughter, Vega. She had contracted sepsis from an antibiotic-resistant bacteriaShortly after giving birth in October 2015 she developed severe lower back pain which her doctor diagnosed as a kidney infection and she was prescribed trimethoprim – a routine antibiotic.It initially helped the pain but did not kill the infection. Within two days she had a fever and became shivery. She told her husband: “I think I’m going to die”.Long read: | \u0027I almost died\u0027: the true cost of antibiotic resistanceShe was rushed to A\u0026ampE and vomited in the corridor on arrival. Because the trimethoprim had not worked doctors did not administer antibiotics straight away.Instead, they waited for the results of her blood and urine tests, which confirmed the presence of an E. coli infection resistant to all but two antibiotics.Nina had sepsis and was moved to her own room where she was given paracetamol, fluids and a rare antibiotic – aztreonam – administered three times daily, intravenously over a 12-day period.For 10 days she showed no sign of improvement. Her temperature continued to spike and her blood pressure became so low that doctors feared she was in septic shock, a life-threatening condition.Eventually, the infection was beaten back and she was discharged. It took her nine months to fully recover and she has since taken out private health insurance for regular UTI check-ups.Nina has returned to full health but the thought of what could have happened still haunts her.I could have died, I could have left this child and my husband alone,” she says.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Ethiopia and Eritrea declare end of decades-long warThai cave rescue mission resumes: \u0026#39Eight boys freed\u0026#39 as five remain trapped - latest updatesStudent died after complaining of a sore throatMyanmar charges two Reuters journalists with obtaining state secretsJacob Zuma\u0026#39s son Duduzane bailed after appearing in South African court on corruption chargesPowders to be banned from hand luggage at UK airportsIranian women post videos of themselves dancing in support of arrested teenagerParents of boys rescued from Thai cave told \u0026#39no hugging or kissing\u0026#39 until health checks are clearedWho could be the next Tory leader if Theresa May is ousted?

The environment ministry in Beijing could not immediately be reached for comment.A representative from one company cited in the report said the firm sources CFCs from unlicensed factories with shady operations in Inner Mongolia and conceals the substance from customs agents.Others cited in the report said their companies produce the substance themselves, with one source saying its factories can produce 40 tonnes of CFC agents per day.Traders cited by EIA also said that Chinese companies export the banned CFC agents by mislabelling them as Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) compounds and other chemical blends.Given the volume of exports of such compounds to other countries primarily in Asia and the Middle East, there is a good chance nations that have pledged to ban CFCs have inadvertently imported them, the report said.If China doesn\u0027t stop this illegal production, it will imperil our slowly healing ozone layer, said Alexander von Bismarck, EIA US Executive Director.CFC-11 is also a super global warmer, making this a serious threat for our climate as well, he added.The report comes ahead of a working group of the Montreal Protocol in Vienna from July 11-14, where the issue of rogue CFC-11 emissions is likely to be on the agenda.In May, an international team of scientists published research that showed the decline of CFC-11 in the atmosphere had slowed by half since 2012, suggesting it was being secretly produced despite the global ban.Researchers said the data pointed to East Asia as the source of renewed production but they stopped short of naming a specific country.At present, Earth is on course for several degrees of warming by 2100, scientists say. This would doom many parts of the planet to worsening floods, droughts, desertification, rising seas and storms.Thai cave rescue mission resumes: \u0026#39Eight boys freed\u0026#39 as five remain trapped - latest updatesStudent died after complaining of a sore throat\u0026#39Sepsis meant my child could have been left without a mother\u0026#39Myanmar charges two Reuters journalists with obtaining state secretsJacob Zuma\u0026#39s son Duduzane bailed after appearing in South African court on corruption chargesPowders to be banned from hand luggage at UK airportsIranian women post videos of themselves dancing in support of arrested teenagerParents of boys rescued from Thai cave told \u0026#39no hugging or kissing\u0026#39 until health checks are clearedWho could be the next Tory leader if Theresa May is ousted?

other than in photographs released by Kensington Palace - since making his public debut on the steps of the Lindo Wing.Prince George gurgled and blew bubbles ahead of his christening in 2013, while Princess Charlotte was seen crying as she was about to be taken into church in 2015.Charlotte - who is three - is becoming known for her polished public appearances where she confidently gives a royal wave for the cameras.Royal christenings through the years, in picturesWill Prince George get bored?George was spotted looking less than enthused at the Trooping the Colour celebrations in 2017.George, who is nearly five, is expected to join his family for the 40-minute church service, but royal nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo could be on hand in her traditional Norland uniform to look after her charges.William and Kate\u0027s choice of godparents offers an insight into their trusted inner circle.In the past, the Duke and Duchess have chosen close friends and confidantes including their university friend Oliver Baker and Kate\u0027s school friend Sophie Carter.The Duchess of SussexIt will be the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first time at a royal christening if she attends as expected.All eyes will be on the Duchess\u0027s choice of outfit and if she continues her trend of opting for a neutral palette.Royal fans will also be looking for signs of broodiness as she joins the Cambridges\u0027 young children at the service.Royal babies are baptised in the same intricate cream lace christening gown.It is a replica of a 19th century one used for most of Queen Victoria\u0027s children which is now too delicate to wear.At the christening of William\u0027s children, there has usually been a poignant nod to the duke\u0027s late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed in a car crash in 1997.The princess\u0027s friend Julia Samuel was made George\u0027s godmother, while Diana\u0027s niece Laura Fellowes is one of Charlotte\u0027s.The Chapel Royal is where Diana\u0027s coffin lay before her funeral to allow her family to pay their last respects.Royal christenings are steeped in tradition, with customs passed down through the generations.When Prince Louis is baptised on Monday at the Chapel Royal, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expected to keep to convention.Louis is expected to wear the royal christening robe - a replica of the original Honiton lace and satin robe made in 1841 for Queen Victoria\u0027s eldest daughter.The new robe was created by the Queen\u0027s dresser Angela Kelly. The original cream lace and white satin robe was last used in 2004 and is too delicate to be worn.According to tradition, the water used for Louis\u0027s christening will be holy water from the River Jordan, where it is said Jesus was baptised by John the Baptist.Prince George leaves the Church of St Mary Magdalene for the christening of Princess Charlotte in July 2015Louis will also be expected to be christened using the ornate silver gilt Lily Font - part of the Crown Jewels.It is decorated with lilies and ivy foliage around the rim, features three cherubs around the base, and the main bowl is a large lily bloom.The Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace, London, was used for Prince George\u0027s christening in 2013.Royal christenings are usually private affairs and most royal babies have been christened at royal palaces.William and the Prince of Wales were both christened in Buckingham Palace\u0027s Music Room.Princess Charlotte is pushed in her silver cross pram as she leaves the Church of St Mary Magdalene at her christeningThe Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, was christened in the Palace\u0027s private chapel in 1926.Prince Harry, now the Duke of Sussex, was christened in St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, where he was married in May.Princess Charlotte, however, was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham in Norfolk.She was pushed to her christening past well-wishers in a vintage 1950s silver-wheeled Millson pram - once used for the Queen\u0027s youngest children Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.Prince Louis of Cambridge is 11 weeks old - here is what we know about him so far:His full name is HRH Prince Louis Arthur Charles of Cambridge.He was born on patriotic St George\u0027s Day - April 23 - at 11.01am at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington, London.He weighed 8lb 7oz - but was not the heaviest royal baby in modern times. The Queen\u0027s first great-grandchild Savannah Phillips weighed 8lb 8oz in 2010, and the newest addition to the Windsors, Zara Tindall\u0027s daughter Lena, born last month, weighed 9lb 3oz.Louis, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s third child, is the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s sixth great-grandchild. They now have seven after the arrival of Lena Tindall.He slept well early on. Two days after Louis was born, William revealed at an Anzac Day service that the baby and Kate were in good form, luckily. Sleeping\u0027s going reasonably well so far, so he\u0027s behaving himself, which is good, he added.But it\u0027s three times as much worry for the Duke. Father of three William declared it was thrice the worry now when he left the hospital with the duchess to take newborn Louis back home to Kensington Palace.The name took people by surprise. William and Kate had already used Louis as one of Prince George\u0027s middle names, but liked it so much they decided to use it again. It has a poignant meaning for the Windsors. Louis was the name of the Prince of Wales\u0027s beloved great-uncle Earl Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979.Princess Charlotte is smitten with her little brother. Kensington Palace released sweet images of Charlotte cuddling baby Louis to mark her third birthday. Charlotte was pictured gently kissing the newborn on the top of his head.He is unlikely to be king. Louis is fifth in line to the throne, with the Prince of Wales, William, George and Charlotte ahead of him in the line of succession.Please review our commenting policyEthiopia and Eritrea declare end of decades-long warThai cave rescue mission resumes: \u0026#39Eight boys freed\u0026#39 as five remain trapped - latest updatesStudent died after complaining of a sore throat\u0026#39Sepsis meant my child could have been left without a mother\u0026#39Myanmar charges two Reuters journalists with obtaining state secretsJacob Zuma\u0026#39s son Duduzane bailed after appearing in South African court on corruption chargesPowders to be banned from hand luggage at UK airportsIranian women post videos of themselves dancing in support of arrested teenagerParents of boys rescued from Thai cave told \u0026#39no hugging or kissing\u0026#39 until health checks are clearedWho could be the next Tory leader if Theresa May is ousted?

Rebecca O’Keeffe, head of investment at interactive investor, said: “The Brexit secretary may be a bit disappointed that far from the market being devastated by the news, investors have shrugged off his departure.”While she noted that Theresa May “still has a mountain to climb in terms of surviving any threats to her position and getting the white paper through parliament”, Ms O’Keeffe added: “Despite all the hurdles, the chances of a soft Brexit are rising, and if it can be done, some UK-focused sectors, as well as the pound itself, could become a lot more attractive.”Experts said the strengthening of the pound was an indication that traders have taken Mr Davis’s departure as a sign that a soft Brexit is now more likely. “Judging by the market reaction, investors interpreted the development as increasing the odds for a “softer Brexit”, as one of the leading Brexiteers left the administration and the negotiations may soon be able to move forward – if the EU accepts the plan, of course,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at XM Group.

It would do the exact opposite it would take the pressure off them. Now is not the moment to do that.10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate changeA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

Mr Davis’ chances of being the next Tory leader had fallen from 50-1 to 12-1.“There have been a couple of big punts on him overnight,” said spokesperson Mark Pearson.But, conversely perhaps, the odds of Mrs May remaining as prime minister until at least the end of the year stayed largely unmoved. She is still the favourite to be leading the country into 2019.“I think people – in the country and in the Conservative party – are thinking that yes it’s chaos but, ultimately, there’s a wariness that a change in leader would only add to that chaos, and I think the odds reflect that,” said Mr Pearson.He added that should voters be sent to the polls for the third time in four years, the result would probably be much the same as last time out: no overall majority remains the most likely outcome with odds of just 11-8 being offered.\u0026nbspThe chances of a Conservative victory are 15-8, with Labour marginally behind at 9-4.UK news in picturesBritain\u0027s new Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Dominic Raab leaves 10 Downing Street after it was announced he was appointed to the job.

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesIndonesia worker and firefighters try to extinguish a fire on fishing boats at Benoa harbour in Denpasar, on Indonesia\u0027s resort island of Bali.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The White Paper therefore needs to deliver confidence for the UK\u0027s world-leading services sector, as well as goods.Meanwhile, Europe\u0027s leaders must approach the UK\u0027s proposals with an open mind and flexibility, putting jobs and economic growth at the heart of a future deal that delivers for both sides.David Davis resigned from his position as Brexit Secretary late last nightWho is Dominic Raab?Dominic Raab is a Conservative MP and was a prominent Leave campaigner during the 2016 EU referendum.\u0026nbspAn MP for Esher and Walton, he has served in government since 2015, joining after the election.Before becoming an MP in 2010, Mr Raab was a lawyer having studied at Lady Margeret Hall, Oxford, then gaining a Masters degree at Jesus College, Cambridge.The Prime Minister gathered her cabinet together ahead of a crunch Brexit showdown at her country retreat at Chequers in Buckinghamshire                    PA1 of 14Members of the cabinet and government officials gather at Chequers"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/977506_1.jpg","title":"brexit news david davis theresa may lord adonis second referendum vote","story":"Lord Adonis went on a Twitter tirade as he compared the crisis engulfing the Government to anger over the poll tax and the Suez crisis.He wrote: \u0026ldquoDD sounding death knell of Mrs May because of constant line: \u0026lsquono further concessions\u0026rsquo.\u0026nbspIt isn\u0026rsquot possible to agree a customs \u0026amp trade deal without further movement to the Norway model.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoSo constant party crisis is the only way Mrs May can continue, if she can carry on at all.

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet. And still lost!It also transpires that it was Cameron who begged Barack Obama to say, “The UK is going to be in the back of the queue,” if we dared to leave the EU.You shouldn’t be writing your memoirs, Mr Cameron.You should be writing us a letter of apology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done. But our ambitious, effective proposal for a smooth customs arrangement and continued security co-operation is a huge step forward.It’s a good deal for Europe, and a good deal for Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

as the toddler appeared to be fine, pointing out things he wanted in a gift shop.It was only when they put George on the sofa that they realised something was seriously wrong.He went to climb off but just collapsed and started crying, she said.He couldnt stand up so we decided to rush him to the hospital to see what was wrong.I still just thought it was a pulled muscle or a twisted ankle at this point.After rushing George to A\u0026ampE at a hospital in Grimsby, X-Ray scans showed the tot had broken his leg.Shona added: I felt like the worst mum in the world.The doctor said this is a really common injury with toddlers.Because he was still young and had flexible bones he was only in a cast for two weeks.I just dont think people know about the risks.George was my first child and I hadnt been told by anyone about the danger.Shona - who is now pregnant with her second son - now wants to warn others of the risks posed by indoor play areas.There should be clear signs warning parents not to go down the slides with their parents, she said.Saying that there should be a minimum age for kids to go on them.I would just urge parents to watch this video and learn from my mistake."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419015702.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pippa middleton shows off her baby bump as she picks up a hat just day before nephews christening","story":"Pippa, 34, was relaxed as she strolled along the sunny street in Chelsea last week joined by her two dogs.Pippa, sister to the Duchess of Cambridge, and her husband James Matthews are expecting their first child in October and the mum-to-be looked radiant as she walked in the sunshine to apparently pick up a hat from celebrated milliner Jane Taylor on the Kings Road in Chelsea.The hat maker is a favourite of her sisters as Kate wore a Jane Taylor creation for both the christenings of her children Prince George and Princess Charlotte.Pippa also wore a Jane Taylor hat for Charlottes christening at Sandringham.Bespoke Jane Taylor hats can cost as much as £1,500 and can take between four and six weeks to make.Pippa, who tied the knot with banker James, 42, on May 30 last year, wore a long white summer dress and gladiator-style sandals for the shopping trip.Her dogs, a spaniel and black Labrador, joined her.Prince Louis, son to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, will be christened at the Chapel Royal, St James Palace in London by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby on Monday.The chapel is the same place Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England in a secret ceremony just before her wedding in May to Prince Harry.Members of the Royal Family as well as Pippa and her parents are expected to be there.Pippa was also seen looking relaxed with her bump just days earlier when she wowed in white at Wimbledon.She was joined by her brother, James, who was wearing a navy blazer and blue tie to match Pippas blue espadrille sandals.She recently revealed she still plays tennis while pregnant.Pippa and her husband James are renovating their west London mansion.News of Pippas pregnancy circulated when her sister Kate was due to give birth to Prince Louis.The Duchess of Cambridge could not have been more delighted on learning little sister Pippa was pregnant, a friend revealed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000414746077.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry louis winnie the pooh christening","story":"The 33-year-old newlywed plans to start an exclusive library for the young Prince, in tribute to his late mother, Princess Diana.A friend said: “One of Harry’s happiest childhood memories was being read a bedtime story by his mother.She loved all the old classics and Harry had the brilliant idea of starting a little library of first editions for Louis, Charlotte and George to enjoy as they get older.“He originally wanted to get Lewis Carroll’s Through The Looking Glass, which was on sale for £24,000, but decided Winnie-The-Pooh would be more suitable for a first tome.“Robinson Crusoe was William’s favourite book, but Harry loved all things A.A.

It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic. Compromises are inevitable since we made no plans for No Deal.Thanks to Mrs May’s election horror, the sums do not add up for Brexit. Remainers rule in the Tory Party, the House of Commons and the Lords.Without a heavyweight leader, Brexit Tories know they cannot raise the numbers to oust Mrs May. A failed challenge would only boost her new-found confidence and authority.Michael Gove and others argue a future Brexit Prime Minister — Mr Gove, for instance — could finish the job once we are legally Out.In fact, Britain tends to keep its treaty ­promises.We can’t even count on EU bully Michel Barnier to stir up a revolt.

They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated.

I like Theresa May, I think shes a good Prime Minister.And he slapped down colleagues who are trying to force Mrs May out, saying: “I won’t be encouraging people to do that. I think it’s the wrong thing to do.But he repeated his fierce criticism of her Chequers plan and warned the proposal would be watered down in talks by Brussels.Mr Davis said: My fear is theyll take what weve offered already and then demand some more. Were giving too much away, too easily and thats a dangerous strategy.Hopefully we will resist very strongly any attempt to get any further concessions from us on this.And he dismissed claims by the Government that the proposal thrashed out at Chequers would give Parliament the right to cast off EU regulations in future, saying the freedom to diverge from Europes rules is illusory rather than real because doing would be fiercely resisted by Eurocrats.He also told the BBC he wouldnt demand the resignation of other ministers such as Boris, because people can only make these decisions of conscience, decisions of principle, by themselves in their own minds.Steve Baker, who resigned as a junior Brexit Minister alongside Mr Davis, also warned other MPs not to launch a leadership challenge to the PM by writing letters to the Tory backbench shop steward.He said: Theres no question of letters going in, no question of challenges - what we need is a change of policy, not to challenge the Prime Minister. Dont put in letters, take stock and change the policy.If people think its a good idea to enter a three-month leadership contest following by the inevitable General Election that would be needed to fix the numbers, theyre on another planet.Mr Davis said the reason he quit was because as Brexit Secretary hed be responsible for forcing Mrs Mays plans through the Commons, adding: Thats not a tenable position for somebody who believes in Brexit.But he hinted that at least half a dozen ministers had stood up to the PM at Chequers and said: Some people asked for some of the policies to be changed at the meeting, they werent.He added that he knew even before the Chequers summit that hed be unable to back Mrs May on the issue, calling himself the odd man out - but waited to hear the PM out and then discussed the issue with his wife over the weekend, before announcing he would quit late last night.Mr Davis told talkRADIO: I think it’s a fairly diluted version of Brexit.But he added: My advice to my colleagues is, support the Prime Minister. I don’t agree with the strategy, but she has got to be supported in delivering that strategy.In his resignation letter, Mr Davis said there had been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line.He added that he had previously decided to toe the line and remain in the Cabinet because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market.But in a damning verdict on the PMs recent approach, he wrote: I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely.The Prime Minister now faces a stormy meeting with Tory MPs and peers in Parliament this evening as she tries to keep her fragile administration together.Mrs May had hoped that the Cabinet agreement secured on Friday at Chequers would help her deliver the right Brexit for the UK, with an offer to Brussels to share a common rulebook on goods and form a new UK-EU free trade area.But Mr Davis, whose departure as Brexit Secretary also triggered the resignation of departmental ally Steve Baker, lashed out at the proposals just 48 hours after being part of the Cabinet that agreed them.His letter rubbished Mrs Mays claim that her plan will give Parliament back control of laws illusory rather than real.And he said plans for a common rulebook with the EU for the trade of goods hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense.And in a devastating final blow to the PM, he predicted that her negotiating approach would just lead to further demands for concessions.He became a junior minister after the 2015 election, but was shuffled out of Government when Theresa May took over a year later.But the Prime Minister brought him back into Government in June 2017, when he became the minister of state for courts and justice.The former lawyer began his political career at the Foreign Office in 2000, and led the British team at The Hague dedicated to bringing war criminals to justice.He also advised on the Arab-Israeli Conflict, the EU and Gibraltar, before being hired by David Davis – the man he has today replaced – in 2006.Mr Raab worked as his chief of staff while he served as shadow Home Secretary, until he was elected to Parliament.Born to a Czech-born Jewish father, who came to Britain in 1938 as a refugee, he studied law at Oxford and then Cambridge before becoming a solicitor.A father of two, he and his wife Erika Rey, a Brazilian marketing executive live in Thames Ditton in Surrey.He hit the headlines this year after his diary secretary was allegedly caught selling sex online.But Westminster watchers were also intrigued by the aides claim to an undercover reporter that the minister eats the exact same lunch everyday from Pret A Manger – a chicken caesar and bacon baguette, a superfruit salad and a watermelon smoothie.In her reply, Mrs May told him: I do not agree with your characterisation of the policy we agreed on at Cabinet on Friday.She said: I am sorry that you have chosen to leave the Government when we have already made so much progress towards delivering a smooth and successful Brexit and when we are only eight months from the date set in law when the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.This morning, Mrs May appointed Dominic Raab - previously Justice Minister and Housing Minister - as the new Brexit Secretary.The 44-year-old, who is close to Mr Gove and used to be Mr Davis chief of staff, has long been tipped as a rising star destined for the Cabinet. Many see him as one of the most polished and professional of the passionate Brexiteers in the Tory party.If more pro-Leave Cabinet ministers also walk out, the PM will be plunged into the biggest political crisis of her career with the almost certain prospect of a leadership challenge.Most senior Brexiteers including Liam Fox, Chris Grayling and Andrea Leadsom have already pledged loyalty to embattled Mrs May.Michael Gove also backed the PMs Chequers deal - despite admitting hes unhappy with parts of the plan.Boris Johnson has still made no announcement on his future, while Esther McVey and Penny Mordaunt have also remained silent since the conclusion of the Chequers summit.But he warned the PM not to give any more ground on Brexit and called on her to scrap her Chequers plan for customs.Speaking on LBC, the head of the European Research Group said: I dont think a no confidence vote is immediately in the offing, I think what the Prime Minister needs to do is to give up on the Chequers proposals which dont actually deliver Brexit.The Conservative party doesnt have a great history of changing its leader - I think its the policy that matters rather than the leader.Asked if he wants to take over as PM, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: No of course not, Im seeking Brexit... Personal ambition is trivial compared to the interests of the nation.But he added: The problem with Chequers is that the Prime Minister was very clear that Brexit would mean Brexit.She made any number of statements indicating that she was going to do it properly, and then she has decided to have a basically Remain approach to the negotiations. That is what has done her damage.If the Government wants to get Chequers through she will have to do so on the back of Labour votes, which would be a great mistake.Mr Rees-Mogg said he gave the Chequers proposals four out of ten as he urged Mrs May to take a tougher line with Brussels.And he insisted he wouldnt accept the job of Brexit Secretary if offered, because his hands would be tied by No 10.Mr Daviss exit will also embolden Brexiteer backbench MPs with concerns about Mrs Mays leadership.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who heads up a group of 60 Tory Brexiteers, said: This is very important. It raises the most serious questions about the PMs ideas.Peter Bone welcomed Mr Daviss resignation, saying it was a principled and brave decision.The PMs proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable, he said.Andrea Jenkyns said Mr Daviss departure was fantastic news and hailed Mr Baker as another courageous and principled MP.This morning she insisted Mrs May must resign and let someone else take over, saying: The time has come that we need a Brexiteer Prime Minister, somebody who really believes in Brexit.Theresa Mays premiership is over, MPs in our party need to think long and hard over the next few days. I want one who passionately believes in Brexit, who provides true leadership.Andrew Bridgen added: I think there will be other resignations unless the PM announces the Chequers deal is being shelved.But Mr Rees-Mogg urged caution, saying: I dont think a no confidence vote is immediately in the offing.The Conservative party doesnt have a great history of changing its leader - I think its the policy that matters rather than the leader.The under-fire PM has been slammed over the soft Brexit proposal agreed by her Cabinet at Chequers on Friday.Eurosceptics have accused her of letting down the 17.4million voters who backed Leave.Last night Brexit Secretary David Davis quit the government in protest at the PMs plans for a soft Brexit.Mr Davis announced his resignation just minutes before midnight with a devastating letter warning Mrs May her proposal would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.May will urge the Conservative Party to stand united and she faces MPs in the Commons this afternoon before a crunch meeting with backbenchers tonight.She must talk them round or face plans to oust her as leader.Eurosceptics claim MPs have started sending no-confidence letters which will spark a leadership contest if 48 are received.Backbench Tories have urged pro-Brexit ministers to quit in protest at the new Brexit blueprint.Letters calling for a leadership contest have reportedly been submitted to the backbench 1922 Committee by some Conservatives over the weekend.Chairman Graham Brady refused to comment today, saying: My view ever since I became chairman of the 22 is that it would be entirely improper ever to comment in any way on that subject, because inevitably a commentary could influence the course of events.Mrs May is expected to use a Commons statement today to tell MPs that the strategy agreed on at Chequers is the right Brexit for Britain.She repeated her defence of her plans - insisting her blueprint would undoubtedly mean the returning of powers from Brussels.Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, a key ally of Mrs May, today praised Mr Davis as a key architect of Brexit who has real integrity - but claimed his resignation wont distract the PM from getting on with the job.He told the BBC: The one thing that will damage our country the most is if we dont get behind our Prime Minister.Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House who campaigned for Brexit, added: My eyes are fixed on the prize, I am a massive believer on the opportunity of Brexit.And calling on the EU to step up the pace of talks on a future trade deal, she said: David Davis has always been a voice of claim in all this, in return for which weve had nothing but insults and stonewalling.Labour called for the PM to quit herself following Mr Davis resignation.Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows Theresa May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit.With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, its clear shes more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.Party chairman Ian Lavery added: This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.“The Prime Minister is in office but not in power. She cannot deliver Brexit and our country is at a complete standstill, while the Tories indulge in their leadership tussling.And trade experts warned that the technology needed to make Max Fac - a solution which replaces border controls with electronic monitoring - work wont be ready in time for Brexit.The third way is designed to bring a compromise on customs between the two systems.Britain would scrap the blanket tariffs applied by the EU on most goods coming in from outside Europe, and instead set its own import duties.That is essential in letting the UK strike new trade deals with the rest of the world, with goods coming in tariff-free from countries such as the US.But to enable big companies to continue using supply chains which span the whole of Europe, Britain will continue to apply EU tariffs on around 4 per cent of products - classified as unfinished goods.And European tariffs will also be put on goods which pass through Britains ports on their way to the EU, but never enter the domestic economy.Another measure which would tie the UK closely to the EU is Mrs Mays proposal for full regulatory alignment for goods.That means Britain would copy European regulations on what products can be sold in shops.Its intended to ensure goods can still be imported and exported freely, while avoiding curbs on the services sector which makes up most of our economy.But it could prove controversial because it may hinder trade deals with countries who have different standards for their goods.“We can’t go on like this. Britain needs a functioning Government.”Labour MPs have been asked to attend a meeting with Mrs Mays chief of staff Gavin Barwell today, in an attempt to win them over to the PMs Chequers deal - which could be the Tories only chance to get the plans successfully through the House of Commons.Allies of Mr Davis said he decided to quit because he felt the PM’s proposals for a common rulebook with the EU and plans to keep Britain tied to 40 years of EU laws broke the Tory manifesto and Mrs May’s own red lines on leaving.Sarah O’Grady, wife of Mr Daviss chief of staff Stewart Jackson, said Mr Davis wanted to “honour manifesto promises to Britons”.She added: “DD decided he couldn’t sellout his own country.”Mr Daviss department - technically in charge of Brexit negotiations - had been kept in the dark over the PMs final Brexit blueprint that was presented to the Cabinet on Friday.He was understood only to have seen the plans at the same time as other Cabinet ministers on Thursday afternoon.He and Mr Johnson were furious at the PM for showing the proposals to German Chancellor Angela Merkel before them.Eight per cent were left undecided.A separate poll for the Mail on Sunday found 38 per cent of the public viewed Mrs May’s new proposals as a “sell-out”.It found the Tories have lost their lead over Labour. Jeremy Corbyn’s party leapfrogged the Tories and now lead by 40-38 per cent.Mrs May has repeatedly preferred the counsel and ideas of her civil servant, EU advisor Olly Robbins, over his — a humiliation no senior elected politician should have to take.Davis’s fervent Brexiteer deputy at the Department for Exiting the EU, Steve Baker, following him out of the door is also very significant, as it now resembles the beginning of a leadership coup.In the past eight months Theresa May  has seen her First Minister, Defence Secretary, Home Secretary, Development Secretary and now Brexit Secretary all resign.Normally, Prime Ministers don’t survive that kind of severe and damaging  blow to their political authority.Can this one? We will know by the end of this week."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004183985983.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says theresa may brexit marxism","story":"The Chequers compromise is bad enough — though we understand the necessity of this minority Government buying off the Remainers who dominate Parliament and who would kill Brexit entirely given the chance.But many Tory MPs and Leave voters already consider it a complete betrayal.

heres what he said.David Davis wrote a withering resignation letter delivered to Number 10 on July 8, 2018.It came just days after Mrs Mays plans for leaving the EU were hammered out at a Cabinet meeting in Chequers.He warned the proposals would leave the UK in a weak negotiating position with Brussels.Ex-SAS reservist Mr Davis said there had been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line.He added that he had previously decided to toe the line and remain in the Cabinet because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market.But in a damning verdict on the PMs recent approach, he wrote: I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely. Mr Davis letter was tweeted out by Sun man Harry Cole on the night of the bombshell resignation.It can be read in full below...As you know there have been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line, ranging from accepting the Commissions sequencing of negotiations through to the language on Northern Ireland in the December Joint Report.At each stage I have accepted collective responsibility because it is part of my task to find workable compromises, and because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market.I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely.Whether it is the progressive dilution of what I thought was a firm Chequers agreement in February on right to diverge, or the unnecessary delays of the start of the White Paper, or the presentation of a backstop proposal that omitted the strict conditions that I requested and believed that we had agreed, the general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one.The Cabinet decision on Friday crystallised this problem.In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real.As I said at Cabinet, the common rule book policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense.I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions.Of course this is a complex area of judgement and it is possible that you are right and I am wrong.However, even in that event it seems to me that the national interest requires a Secretary of State in my Department that is an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript.While I have been grateful to you for the opportunity to serve, it is with great regret that I tender my resignation from the Cabinet with immediate effect.Yours everDavid DavisJust a day after David Davis resignation, Dominic Raab has been named as the new Brexit Secretary.The ex-Justice minister and Brexiteer steps up to fill the vacant role after Davis dramatically quit.Dominic Raab was appointed Minister of State for Housing at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government on January 9, 2018.He was Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice from June 12, 2017, to January 9, 2018.He was elected Conservative MP for Esher and Walton in May 2010."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418979250.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather 50th day sunshine 30c heat heatwave","story":"Temperatures are today expected to reach 30C, making it the 16th day in a row sun-lovers have welcomed temperatures of more than 28C.And while the mercury is expected to dip later this week, temperatures are predicted to climb back up to the high 20s by the weekend.Met Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said: Some areas of the UK will still be hot today.The main areas are towards South West England and London, with it reaching 30C in those areas.Elsewhere its going to feel a little fresher.She warned this week could even see scattered showers developing.Ms Mitchell said: On the whole, its going to feel less hot.There will be sunny spells throughout but some areas like Wales and central England could see some heavy showers.But she said it would be just a temporary blip as temperatures again warmed this weekend.It comes as sun-loving Brits flooded to parks and beaches yesterday, making the most of Englands hottest day of the year.Temperatures hit a high of 32.4C in Gosport, Hampshire yesterday.It comes as water companies urged people to use water sparingly to avoid a potential hosepipe ban.United Utilities, which serves homes and businesses in the North West -

but it was backed by a teaching union.Dad Martin Macdonald, of Bucksburn, Aberdeen, said: “It’s quite ridiculous. Children shouldn’t be missing out because of their parents’ actions.”Shop worker and mum Christine Dines said: “It’s a bit extreme and the kids shouldn’t be punished for this.”Minister and father-of-two Barry Douglas, from Bridge of Don, said: “We live in a world of social media where things happen quickly, so it could be a heat of the moment thing of frustration where a parent has a rant.”The council’s Liberal Democrat education spokesman Martin Greig said: “Parents have a right and a duty to express their views about their child’s education.“If there are any concerns or questions these need to be encouraged and taken seriously.“The council should not try and stop parents from giving comments. Their attitude is setting up barriers instead of building up trust.”It’s understood teachers were concerned by posts in which members of parenting groups complained about school facilities.Ron Constable of the EIS union said: “It is particularly troubling that this abuse is being conducted where children and young people are able to witness this behaviour including inappropriate language and intimidation.“The abuse of members over social media is a major concern for the EIS in Aberdeen and we have experienced a significant increase in the number of members seeking advice about this issue.”The city council said: “The council’s policy, which has been in place for a number of years, states that the inappropriate use of social media by either pupil or parent making derogatory comments in relation to a pupil, staff member or school is likely to lead to exclusion.“We always encourage parents to use social media responsibly and we would only consider exclusion as a last resort.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000414746077.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince louis godparents queen prince philip miss christening","story":"The 92-year-old monarch will instead be travelling back from Norfolk, forced to miss this afternoons christening at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace.Buckingham Palace today said the decision that the Queen and her 97-year-old husband would be absent had been made some time ago and was not due to health reasons.Instead, the ever-busy monarch will be on the road ahead of a busy week of engagements that include President Donald Trumps visit to Windsor this Friday.It comes after Kensington Palace today announced Prince Louis six godparents -

Of which minister Davis was here for four this year.His role has always been more defined in London. So that’s where they will have to look at the consequences. On this end we will just negotiate with whomever the UK government sends here to do so.Others have taken aim at Mr Davis for choosing to step away from the talks at such a crucial moment, with another EU diplomat saying: The resignation will be framed as not taking responsibility for a soft Brexit but looks more like not taking responsibility at all.“It is starting to look like the flight of the Brexiteers.With suggestions other leading Eurosceptics in the Government could resign too, another diplomat said: They [Brexiteers] landed your country in a mess and now they’re leaving for higher ground.Rats and sinking ships, that age old tale.But the EU Commission officially said it had no specific comment to make on Mr Daviss resignation, adding: Well continue to negotiate in good faith with PM May and the UK government.”Mr Davis resigned saying the PM was pursuing a dangerous strategy he could no longer support, after she finally got her Cabinet to sign off on a basis for talks with the EU.But Mrs May faces a further headache after the Irish deputy PM says the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier will find it “difficult” to accept the proposal agreed at Chequers on Friday.This is because it will keep the UK tied to the EU’s rules but only on goods and agricultural products – and Mrs May has repeatedly been warned this approach is “cherry-picking” and will not be approved.Mr Barnier said the discussions at Chequers, the PM’s country estate – are “to be welcomed”, but said he said needed to asses if they are “workable and realistic” ahead of discussions on July 16.But he said he needed to see the full proposals in the Government’s long-await White Paper – expected this week. .This was echoed by others in Brussels, with one diplomatic source telling the Daily Mail: “It’s about the White Paper at the moment. It’s important to wait for that detail. We can’t be sure about anything until we see it.“But what is being said about goods still has a ‘have cake and eat it’ feeling. That will be the sticking point.“The way it’s seen in relation to the single market is, you don’t just swallow one bit, you swallow all of it.”And Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy PM and minister for foreign affairs, said: “The EU has never been keen to facilitate a breaking up of an approach toward the single market in terms of keeping all of the elements of the single market intact and consistent, so I think Britain will find it difficult to persuade the EU to support the approach they’re now proposing.“Michel Barnier will be a very, very strong defender of the EU interests here, in terms of protecting the integrity of the single market and the integrity of the EU customs union.”And another diplomatic source was scathing of the plan, telling The Observer: “A goulash gets better the more it is recooked.“I am not sure about whether the customs proposals share the same quality.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister is fighting for her political life after Mr Davis sensationally quit his Cabinet role overseeing Britain\u0027s exit from the European Union. His devastating resignation letter poured scorn on Theresa May\u0027s progressive dilution of her Brexit strategy - saying she had handed too much power to the EU leading to a weak and possibly inescapable negotiating position. The ex-SAS man warned he had turned into a reluctant conscript. Later in his first interview since quitting he branded the plan dangerous. He was swiftly followed out the door by a second Brexit minister, Steve Baker, a source confirmed.  Mr Davis\u0027 exit comes just nine months before the UK officially leaves the EU - and with just weeks of negotiating time left before a deal is needed in October. Downing Street was due to announce Mr Davis\u0027 successor after 9am on Monday, with speculation Theresa May could choose a Remain-backer to support her new, softer position on Brexit. But the PM - due to address MPs and her party on Monday afternoon - is facing the prospect of a Tory leadership battle. Just 48 MPs need to call for her to quit to trigger a contest.   Labour\u0027s Brexit chief refuses to rule out a second referendum  David Davis resigned just 48 hours after a Chequers summit where Cabinet had supposedly agreed on a major shift to soft Brexit. The Prime Minister enraged Brexiteers by proposing a common rulebook between Britain and the EU for goods imported to the UK. There were also reports she would compromise with Brussels on migration. Hours before Mr Davis resigned Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of around 60 Tory Brexiteers, warned he would vote against the defeatist plan. It is understood the Brexit Secretary had taken the weekend to consider his position and future before deciding he could not continue. Sarah Grady, the wife of Mr Davis\u0027 chief of staff Stewart Jackson, declared: DD decided he couldn’t sellout his own country. All eyes are now on Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who has not yet publicly spoken in favour of the deal and reportedly described it as a turd during the summit.       Brexiteer Tory MP Peter Bone supported David Davis\u0027 decision to quit. David Davis has done the right thing, a principled and brave decision, he said. The PM\u0027s proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows Theresa May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit. With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, it\u0027s clear she\u0027s more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.   Ian Lavery MP, chair of the Labour Party, said: “This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left. “The Prime Minister is in office but not in power. She cannot deliver Brexit and our country is at a complete standstill, while the Tories indulge in their leadership tussling. “We can’t go on like this. Britain needs a functioning Government.”   Tory MPs officially call for vote of confidence in Theresa May - and she expects them to reach crucial threshold  Labour MP Mary Creagh tweeted: David Davis doesn\u0027t even give May the courtesy of resigning during the day. Leadership contest imminent. Johnson \u0026amp Grayling only 2 Leavers who have not backed May publicly this w/end. Tick tock. The PM faces a showdown with 300 Tory MPs on Monday after Boris Johnson said her Brexit plan was “a t**d”.  The PM must convince backbenchers to support her at the 1922 Committee – or face being booted out of Downing Street. Brexiteer minister Michael Gove urged fellow Tory Eurosceptics to “get behind the Prime Minister” over the Chequers deal.  Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson backed the plan, despite saying that it was “like polishing a t**d”. But there was open warfare last night with dozens of Tory MPs plotting to oust Mrs May. A letter is circulating which accuses her of “capitulating” over the Brexit talks. And the resignation of Mr Davis will only pile the pressure on the PM on Monday. A briefing by QC Martin Howe said Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan would lead to a “worst-of-all worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state”.  Brexit Chequers summit explained - your guide to the Cabinet showdown that will make or break Theresa May  It takes just 48 MPs’ votes to trigger a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May. Former Labour minister Lord Mandelson said on BBC’s The Sunday Politics: “The Government has, simply, got itself up sh** creek. Without a paddle.” However, Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns, who quit a junior government role earlier this year to fight for Brexit and has threatened to vote against Theresa May\u0027s plans for exiting the European Union, tweeted her approval of Mr Davis\u0027 resignation. Fantastic news. Well done David Davis for having the principal and guts to resign. I take my hat off to you. We need to make sure this is now a game changer for \u0026poundBrexit. David Davis\u0027s resignation letter to Theresa May Dear Prime Minister As you know there have been a significant number of occasions in the last year or so on which I have disagreed with the Number 10 policy line, ranging from accepting the Commission\u0027s sequencing of negotiations through to the language on Northern Ireland in the December Joint Report. At each stage I have accepted collective responsibility because it is part of my task to find workable compromises, and because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market. I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely. Whether it is the progressive dilution of what I thought was a firm Chequers agreement in February on right to diverge, or the unnecessary delays of the start of the White Paper, or the presentation of a backstop proposal that omitted the strict conditions that I requested and believed that we had agreed, the general direction of policy will leave us in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one. The Cabinet decision on Friday crystallised this problem. In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real. As I said at Cabinet, the common rule book policy hands control of large swathes of our economy to the EU and is certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense. I am also unpersuaded that our negotiating approach will not just lead to further demands for concessions. Of course this is a complex area of judgement and it is possible that you are right and I am wrong. However, even in that event it seems to me that the national interest requires a Secretary of State in my Department that is an enthusiastic believer in your approach, and not merely a reluctant conscript. While I have been grateful to you for the opportunity to serve, it is with great regret that I tender my resignation from the Cabinet with immediate effect. Yours ever, David Davis Theresa May agreed a major shift to soft Brexit at her country retreat Chequers - prompting her Brexit Secretary David Davis to quit. The \u0027third way\u0027 plan for UK customs rules proposed keeping the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. This will include sharing a common rulebook for all goods including agricultural and food products - and a possible compromise on migration. To appease Brexiteers, Parliament would keep the right to block future changes to the trading rules. But David Davis said this olive branch was meaningless in practice. The deal also proposes a common rulebook with the EU on state aid rules, and agrees to step up backup plans for a No Deal Brexit. A full White Paper was due to be published on Thursday 12 July. Prime Minister Theresa May has faced a series of Cabinet members leaving their positions since the snap election last June. The first to leave was defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned his post after being caught up in Westminster sleaze allegations. He said his behaviour had fallen below the high standards required after he admitted putting his hand on the knee of radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer some years ago when he resigned on November 1. One week later, Priti Patel quit as international development secretary over undisclosed and unauthorised meetings in Israel, including with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  In her resignation letter, she echoed the words of Sir Michael, saying her actions fell below the high standards expected. The following month, Ms May\u0027s deputy Damian Green left the Cabinet after a probe found he made inaccurate and misleading statements about pornography on his computer. Justine Greening was sacked in the PM\u0027s reshuffle in January after refusing to move from her education post to the Department for Work and Pensions.  Home secretary Amber Rudd resigned in April after admitting she had inadvertently misled MPs over the existence of targets for removing illegal immigrants over the Windrush scandal.

For a few hours the Prime Minister was being praised for holding her Cabinet together after last Friday’s Chequers summit.   Then David Davis resigned .   The Brexit Secretary’s departure raises two questions: one is about the survival of the Prime Minister and the other is about the survival of Brexit.   If his resignation prompts further Cabinet ministers to quit then Mrs May\u0027s position becomes increasingly perilous.   At the moment most of the Brexiteers (Michael Gove, Chris Grayling, Andrea Leadsom, Liam Fox, Penny Mordaunt etc) appear signed up to the Prime Minister’s plans.        The one exception is Boris Johnson who will make his decision based entirely on whether it will further his ambitions to be Prime Minister.   Davis, of course, will now be in the position to return to his traditional role as a backbench troublemaker but his spell in government has left him more buckled and less swash .   In his interview on the Today programme this morning Davis made clear he would be campaigning to prevent any further concessions to Brussels.   In many ways the more damaging resignation was that of his junior minister Steve Baker.   Baker is a Brexiteer ideologue who has shown in the past he has the drive and organisational skills to marshall discontented Tory eurosceptics.   All of this will make for an uncomfortable meeting when Mrs May addresses the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers this evening.   Some may be emboldened by Davis’s resignation to push for a leadership challenge .   But to what end?      The Brexiteers could topple Mrs May and try to replace with one of their own but it would change neither the fundamentals – a soft Brexit is the only one on the table – nor the maths – there is no Commons majority for a hard Brexit.   Davis’s resignation letter is incendiary because he is fundamentally right about what he says is Mrs May\u0027s dangerous direction of travel.   Mrs May’s offer will almost inevitably lead to the softest of all Brexits and, as Davis notes, it is looking less and less likely we will leave the customs union and the single market.   As the Brexiteer who was in charge of the negotiations Davis must be furious with himself.   His departure is the equivalent of spelling out in neon lights that the whole sorry project has been a failure.    Those who led the campaign to leave did so on the flimsiest and most speculative of prospectuses.   The only way their vision of Brexit can be achieved is for the UK to abandon decades of accumulated rights and protections which, funnily enough, voters tend to prize quite highly.   Mrs May now has to sell her damaged proposals to recalcitrant MPs and to a bemused Brussels.   It is not certain the PM has ever had an overall strategy for delivering Brexit but her modus operandi appears to be nudge her party one step at a time towards the softest of landings.   So far she has got them to swallow the divorce bill, then the transition period, then the Northern Ireland backstop and now full alignment with EU rules and regulations and the oversight of the European Court of Justice.   And in the process she is revealing that the best path for the UK is to work so closely with the EU and so entwine our economies and laws many will wonder why we don’t go the whole hog and remain full members.    When you are running a government which sees a Cabinet minister resign once every six weeks on average then you may conclude things are not going well.   Though Labour should be concerned that the calamitous state of the Government has not yet translated into a surge of support for Her Majesty\u0027s opposition.   As if Mrs May did not have enough on her plate, a British national now appears to have been murdered on UK soil.   Expect a statement to MPs later on the death of Dawn Sturgess who has died after coming into contact with Russian-manufacture Novichok.

The Prime Minister promoted Dominic Raab to be Brexit Secretary after he spent just six months in the job.  The vacancy means the government is having to find its third housing minister since the Grenfell Tower disaster only 13 months ago. Mr Raab\u0027s replacement will be fifth person to hold the role since 2015 and the eighth since 2010. Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey slammed Tory ministers. He said: Dominic Raab\u0027s move means that Theresa May is on her fourth housing minister in just two years as Prime Minister.  There have been eight different housing ministers in the last eight years. This is no way to run a Government.” Mrs May declared it was her personal mission to fix the housing crisis and pledged to build 300,000 homes a year overall by the mid-2020s. But just 39,350 homes started being built in the three months to March - a fall of 8% on a year earlier. It also emerged just two new council homes were started every day, while the number of housing association homes started between fell 14% to 5,230.  Earlier this year the Tory government quietly dropped its key pledge to \u0027fix the broken housing market\u0027 from official plans. Used by Tory ministers since at least 2016, \u0027Fixing our broken housing market\u0027 was the title of a government White Paper in February last year.  The 2017 Tory manifesto also vowed to fix the dysfunctional housing market before the Prime Minister used the phrase in her October conference speech.  But the slogan vanished from the Housing Ministry\u0027s annual \u0027single departmental plan\u0027 - where it was previously objective number one. It has been replaced by deliver the homes the country needs in the new plan. "},{"url":null,"title":"who dominic raab brexit secretary","story":"NewsWho is Dominic Raab?

So who is he? Boxer and karate black belt Mr Raab is a fitting replacement for the ex-SAS reservist as he goes into battle with the EU with just months left on the clock. Aged 44, the Tory Brexit-backer began his political career as Mr Davis\u0027 chief of staff when he was shadow home secretary in 2006. He rocketed through government since being elected MP for Esher and Walton in 2010, and this is his first Cabinet job. But he has some hugely controversial comments to his name. He sparked fury last year by saying most food bank users are not languishing in poverty - even though benefit delays and sanctions are the main reason for people using the handouts.  He claimed: The typical user of a foodbank is not someone that\u0027s languishing in poverty, it\u0027s someone who has a cash flow problem episodically. And when a disability activist told him people are dying under Tory austerity, he dismissed her calls for cash as a childish wish list. He told an election debate just a year ago: The money’s got to come from somewhere. I can think of lots of things that I would like to avoid making difficult decisions on and lots of areas like the health service or schools that I want to put even more money in. But unless you’ve got a strong economy creating the revenue, it’s just a childish wish list. In 2011 Mr Raab said feminists are now amongst the most obnoxious bigots and said it was time for men to start burning their briefs. He defended the remarks only last week.  In February BuzzFeed revealed he belonged to a Facebook group which argued for all of Britain’s council housing to be sold off and the NHS to be privatised. Mr Raab said he wasn\u0027t aware of the group, had inadvertently and mistakenly been linked to it and needless to say I do not support its aims.” But in 2012, Mr Raab was one of five Tory MPs who branded Britons “the worst idlers in the world”. Their book argued: “Too many people in Britain, we argue, prefer a lie-in to hard work. We must get on the side of the responsible, the hard working and the brave. We must stop bailing out the reckless, avoiding all risk, and rewarding laziness.  Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world. We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor.” Mr Raab also shot into headlines after a Mirror investigation exposed his diary secretary selling sex online. He denied her claims that he had exactly the same Pret a Manger lunch each day - a chicken Caesar and bacon baguette, superfruit pot and the vitamin volcano smoothie. “He is so weird. I get it for him. I go to Pret. That’s how I know. It’s the Dom Raab Special, the diary secretary said. Mr Raab said: It\u0027s not actually true.  Former grammar school boy Mr Raab was born to a Czech Jewish father who fled to Britain as a refugee before the Second World War. The Oxford and Cambridge graduate was a City lawyer with Linklaters before joining the Foreign Office in 2000, helping bring war criminals to justice in The Hague. He once found himself defending Tony Blair from being summoned to the international criminal court while working on the trial of Slobodan Milosevic. He left the civil service for hard politics in 2006 becoming the chief of staff to the Tory shadow home secretary - who was none other than David Davis. He lives in Thames Ditton, Surrey, with his wife Erika and two sons Peter and Joshua and his heroes include right-wing US President Ronald Reagan and Gandhi. Mr Raab backed Brexit before the 2016 EU referendum and was on the political advisory board of Leave Means Leave - which branded Theresa May\u0027s latest plans fake Brexit and a total, humiliating capitulation. Theresa May agreed a major shift to soft Brexit at her country retreat Chequers - prompting her Brexit Secretary David Davis to quit.

Already faced with prices soaring by more than \u0026pound1,000 during the school holiday peak, lone parents say the \u0026shyadditional hike can make it impossible to take their children away. And operators such as Jet 2, Tui and First Choice can make the problem worse – as offers of free child places only apply if two paying adults travel with them. Single parent groups say the policy is “unfair” and “out of touch”. We found a one week all-inclusive stay at Bulgaria’s SuneoClub Odessos, \u0026shyflying from Manchester on July 27, costs \u0026pound1,572 for two adults with a free child’s place via First Choice.

Airtours offers “child prices” for some hotels – but only when sharing a room with at least two adults paying full price. Thomas Cook Holidays has the same pricing policy. And because the firms do not count children in the room rate, a single parent can be charged an under-occupancy supplement. But it is not just accommodation – other firms also hit single parents with increased fares.

Her ex-lover Claudio Gouveia, 35, was jailed last month for 12 years for her attempted murder in 2017. Accomplice Edmundo Fonseca, 44, was jailed for nine years last Friday. He was paid just a few grammes of cocaine to throw acid over Ellie near the hotel she worked in on the Algarve in Portugal. He lured her out of the hotel after arranging a dinner date over Tinder and posing as a businessman.  Ellie had no idea it was a fake date set up by her deranged ex. They had split up two months earlier. He still had her laptop and old phone and had hacked into them to access all her emails and social media accounts to trace her every step. She said: “I saw this man dressed in black and I thought, ‘Bloody hell, he’s odd’. “He was sat down on a bench and his leg was shaking up and down. “The next second I hear ‘desculpe!’ [Portuguese for sorry] and he threw liquid all over me.  “In a split second I realised it was acid and I knew straight away it was him [Gouveia]. “I started screaming and told my friend to help, telling her: \u0027It’s acid. He’s set me up!’ “I felt like I was on fire. The burning was unbearable. “I whipped off my blazer because I could see my dress was melting, it was sticking to me so I threw it to the floor. “And then I just started spitting because I could taste it. I could just see my skin dripping to the floor, dripping on to the pavement.”  She believes Gouveia drove by slowly after the attack – “real blas\u0026eacute” – but did not stop. Ellie was finally helped by a taxi driver with a female British passenger. “The woman wound down her window and was speaking to me trying to calm me down as the driver rang the police and ambulance. “The driver’s window was only open slightly and he said he could feel the heat coming off me on his face. “He said it was like ‘a full-blown bonfire’.” Two police officers who attended were sick nearby after inhaling the fumes and later taken to hospital. The pavement where Ellie was struck was bleached white and even a hedge where he flung the bottle burned. “I’ve never felt pain like it. I thought I was going to die. It was unbearable. I could taste it on my tongue and that was worrying me,” she said.  Ellie ended up in the intensive care burns unit in Lisbon in a glass room to protect her from infection. She had second and third degree burns to her face, chest, both arms, stomach and legs. The next morning she was given a mobile in a sealed plastic bag to phone her mum in the Isle of Wight. “I said ‘Mum, now don’t worry because I’m all right. But that b***ard’s got me!’” Her mum Diana Newman, 60, who flew out to be by Ellie’s side, said: “I wasn’t able to hug her or kiss her or even touch her. It was heartbreaking. “She was covered in bandages like a mummy. We touched hands through the glass and we were both crying.” It was the start of a month’s intensive treatment in hospital for Ellie who was too scared to look under her bandages. “It was yucky, my skin was still being eaten and they put my arms in a bleach solution,” Ellie recalled. Ellie finally broke down when they shaved her head to get a skin graft. “I was in tears and the nurse was in tears, it is what finally broke me. He’d finally taken away my identity.”  Gouveia had been trying to break her for much of their relationship. They met a week after Ellie started as a tour rep on his home island of Madeira in 2015. Within months she was banned from going out alone or contacting her parents in the UK. He started messaging her up to 100 times a day. “I started feeling a bit panicky if I didn’t reply. I felt I was on my knees apologising for everything.” The first time he turned violent was after they visited his relatives and he stormed off after drinking for hours. “When he got home he was spitting and effing and jeffing. It was like he was a monster, smashing things, screaming and spitting, it was grim. “He pinned me up against the bathroom wall around the throat. I had a full-on hand print across my neck.” A month later, Gouveia erupted in violence again, splitting her head open after a night out. Ellie had three stitches in hospital. The police were called but said it was her word against his. She never saw him again and relocated to mainland Portugal. But what Ellie did not know was he had kept her laptop and knew all her passwords and tracked her movements for the next two months.  Ellie, now back home with her mum in the Isle of Wight, told how her terror continued in hospital. “When I opened the message in hospital I felt sick,” said Ellie, who is in counselling for post-traumatic stress. “I thought to myself, ‘He’s not going to stop’. He’s a little terrorist.” Fellow acid attack victim Katie Piper helped her get counselling and laser treatment after the tour rep’s brother, Ryan Chessell got in touch.  Ellie said: “I had been struggling to get help from the NHS. When Katie got involved things started moving.” Now the long journey to get back to normal begins. Ellie said: “I’d love to work as a tour rep but at the moment I lack concentration. I sleep too much, I eat too much...but I want to go back and do something I enjoy.” Evil ex sent naked pic to Ellie\u0027s teen brother Deranged ex Claudio Gouveia sent hundreds of menacing messages and naked photos of Ellie to relatives – including her little brother and his teenage friends. He spent two months spying on Ellie after they’d split by hacking into her social media accounts. Just 24 hours after the acid attack, he sneered: “I am looking forward to our next encounter...” Ellie said about the message: “I felt sick, but we all decided as a family not to respond. “He had dozens of different email addresses and sent hundreds of emails to me. He sent Instagrams. He created fake accounts on Facebook.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how keep your kids cool","story":"AdvertorialHow to keep your kids cool during the heatwave: 9 products which can help protect your little onesIce, ice baby. But failing that, here\u0027s how you can keep your family cool now the weather\u0027s turned hot\u0026nbspShareByHolly Thatcher00:00, 5 JUL 2018Updated14:20, 6 JUL 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe\u0027re all having a lovely time in the summer sun thanks to this unexpected heatwave. But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

The heatwave is no fun for anyone, but there are a few things you can do to at least cool down your home. There\u0027s nothing worse than trying to nod off in your room, or trying to relax, while feeling like you\u0027re in the seventh circle of hell. Being in the midst of a heatwave is not as fun as it first sounds, especially without air con, but there are some things you can do to cool down your home and finally get some shut eye. Before we get to how to use a freezer to your advantage (not sticking your head in it) and getting as low as you can (no this isn\u0027t limbo), we have to acknowledge the quickest way is to get air con. Of course, the bad thing about getting air con is the cost - upfront and then running it - so here are a few quick tips and tricks to drop your home\u0027s temperature without spending too much.  Keep away from the satin and silk and opt for the cooler linen and cotton sheets. Light-coloured bed linen made of light fabrics (take Egyptian cotton for example) are breathable so better to sleep in. The Egyptians had it right, in fact, they even had their own method for keeping cool. Known as The Egyptian Method (original, we know) they\u0027d dampen a towel or sheet in cool water and use it as a blanket. It may be a good idea to lay the damp sheet on top of a towel first, no one likes a wet bed. 2. Freezer tricks Speaking of sheets, you can stick them in the freezer for a few minutes before you\u0027re about to go to sleep. No, we haven\u0027t lost our minds, just make sure you put them in something like a plastic bag before you pop them in. You don\u0027t want your sheets smelling of pizza and ice cream. The trick won\u0027t last all night but it will give you a breather so you can get to sleep. 3. Don\u0027t cook a roast  ...or any hot meal. Summer is never the time to be whipping up a casserole or hot meal. Put the slow cooker away, step away from the stove and have a salad. 4. Use that hot water bottle Buy yourself a hot water bottle. While we\u0027re used to filling them with hot water in the winter to keep toasty, in the summer sticking it in the freezer instead creates a lovely ice pack. 5. Turn your fan around Fans are great in the mild heat, but when it\u0027s cranked up they just blow hot air around so it\u0027s all about strategic placement. If you point them outside, slightly towards the windows, they push out the hot air. If you have a ceiling fan set them counter-clockwise to pull the hot air away. 6. Ice fan  We\u0027ve already mentioned fans, but there\u0027s so much more to be said. At school we used to use those little iceboxes to keep our food cool, so this idea comes from that. It\u0027s sort of a DIY aircon system. Use a roasting pan, or box and fill it with ice and put it in front of a fan. When the ice melts the breeze from the fan picks up the cool air coming from the ice\u0027s surface, creating a nice cool mist. 7. Cross breeze More of the fan tricks. Strategically place numerous fans around a room. Put a fan by the window, and then another further inside the room so they both push the cooler air around the room. 8. How low can you go Hot air rises so sleeping in a room on the ground floor means you\u0027ll feel cooler. If you\u0027re in a one-storey flat you can move your sheet to the ground to make life easier. 9. Don\u0027t get steamy  We imagine you\u0027re continually hopping in the shower to cool down, just make sure the water is tepid rather than warm/hot. Steam hangs about and makes a room that much hotter. 10. No lights This should make sense. Light bulbs - even if they\u0027re environmentally friendly - give off heat, so switch them off. The sun shines for longer now anyway so keeping the lights off not only saves on your energy bill, but cuts down on the extra heat. 11. Hang a wet sheet Yes, you read that right. Hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window will help bring down the room\u0027s temperature. 12. No electronic devices  The same applies here as the lights. Unplug your phone and devices, do not charge them when you are asleep. Everything radiates heat and you don\u0027t need that when you\u0027re trying to catch some zzzs. 13. Use grains Buckwheat pillows don\u0027t absorb heat like cotton does so getting one is a good investment for summer. 14. Closing curtains  In the daytime. If you think about when the sun is at its hottest those rays are coming through the window hotting everything up. Close the curtains and your room is instantly cooler.  15. Use your garden  If you plant the right trees and shrubs around the house they will provide you with much needed shade. Vines work well too. Of course that won\u0027t work for this summer, but next year you\u0027ll be thanking us. 16. Paint it white  Again, maybe one for next year, but painting your house white helps. The white colour reflects the light, cooling the house down. 17. Insulate  Long-term thinking again. When you think of insulation you probably think of keeping warm, but it can work the other way too. Good insulation keeps the heat out as well once the room is cooled down.

It is believed to have been sent to boost the confidence of her classmate, who a head teacher described as very unsure of herself. Her former headteacher Christine Knudsen told Channel 5\u0027s How to Bag a Prince: I got this letter from one of the students in her group.

I am so lucky to have you in my group and to be able to lead you on this adventure. Never stop sharing your beautiful spirit and always remember how special you are. I am here if you ever need me. I love you, Meghan.  Maria Pollia, a religious studies teacher at the school, also told the show about how Meghan asked her for advice on how to help homeless people. One day, after class, Meghan approached me and said, So tell me more about serving on Skid Row.\u0027 \u0027nd so I suggested she continued to volunteer at this soup kitchen in her senior year.

He bought his second nephew a first edition of AA Milne\u0027s Winnie-The-Pooh to mark the special day. Despite the jaw-dropping price, there\u0027s actually an extremely special story behind the expensive gift, and it\u0027s a touching tribute to William and Harry\u0027s late mum Diana.  According to Harry\u0027s close friends, the new Duke of Sussex plans to start a library for little Louis.  The source told the Sun : One of Harry’s happiest childhood memories was being read a bedtime story by his mother.  She loved all the old classics and Harry had the brilliant idea of starting a little library of first editions for Louis, Charlotte and George to enjoy as they get older. He originally wanted to get Lewis Carroll’s Through The Looking Glass, which was on sale for \u0026pound24,000, but decided Winnie-The-Pooh would be more suitable for a first tome.  The book reportedly dates back to 1926 and is one of 30,000 printed in the first run. Prince Louis will be christened in the Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace in a service led by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.

The ceremony itself will take place at The Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace , which is where big brother George had his, led by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.  After the service, which is expected to take about 45 minutes, guests will head over to Clarence House for a private tea. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have decided to serve a very traditional treat, and it will be extra special for them.  Guests will tuck into a lovely christening cake which is actually a tier from Kate and William\u0027s wedding cake. It\u0027s normally traditional for couples to save a tier to serve at their first child\u0027s christening, but the Cambridges have done it for all three of their children. Luckily Kate and Wills had a giant wedding cake so there were enough tiers for George, Charlotte and Louis to all have one. In fact, their cake had EIGHT ties and was made from 17 fruit cakes. It took five weeks to make and was decorated with 900 individually iced flowers and leaves.  Speaking at the time, designer Fiona Cairns said: The picture gallery has high ceilings and is an imposing room so I wanted the cake to have presence but not to be imposing and I think it worked. Catherine did not want it to be seven feet tall, she didn\u0027t want it to be towering and thin, and I think we succeeded. We reflected some of the architectural details in the room so the garlands on the walls were reproduced loosely on the fourth tier - we\u0027ve used roses, acorns, ivy leaves, apple blossom and bridal rose. Ahead of the christening the royal family released a statement announcing more details of the big day.

Despite the little royal being the fifth in the line to the throne, it\u0027s likely to be a quiet affair with just close family and friends invited. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will lead the service at the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. It\u0027s the same place where Louis\u0027 big brother George was christened back in 2013, while Princess Charlotte had her service at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Norfolk in 2015. But even though it will be a small and private event, it is royal after all so there are of course some special and rather odd traditions Kate and Wills must stick to.  Lily font  Kate and Wills will be brining one very special item to the church for the special day - the Lily Font .  The royal family\u0027s special font, which has been used for every christening since 1841, is made from silver gilt and decorated with flowers, ivy and cherubs. It also features the royal arms of Queen Victoria and the joint royal arms of Victoria and Prince Albert - Prince Louis\u0027 great-great-great-great-great-grandparents, who were married in the Chapel Royal in 1840.   The 17inch tall font is gilded in silver and is believed to cost \u0026pound11,000, reports the Sun .  However, experts believe it if was sold at auction today it would sell for a lot more. The receipt at the time, dated, February 8, 1841, lists the price as \u0026pound189 9s. The font was commissioned for Princess Victoria\u0027s christening more than 170 years ago. When it\u0027s not being used the font is kept locked away with all of the rest of the royal family\u0027s most valuable possessions.  You can read more about the Lily Font here .  Gown Despite being a senior member of the royal family, Prince Louis won\u0027t get a fancy new gown for his christening. But instead, he will wear something extremely special which is an important part of his family\u0027s history.   He\u0027ll wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by all royal babies since 1841.  The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria and was worn by 62 royal babies, including the Queen. It was made by Scottish dressmaker Janet Sutherland.  But after so much wear the original was becoming too delicate and the family decided to have a replica made for the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s son James in 2008. The new gown was made by the Queen\u0027s dressmaker Angela Kelly and has been worn by every royal baby since, including Prince George, Princess Charlotte and now Prince Louis.

The announcement was made this morning ahead of the special ceremony at the Chapel Royal of St James\u0027s Palace in central London at 4pm. The 11-week-old royal will be joined by his parents\u0027 close friends and relatives. But his great-grandmother the Queen, and her husband Prince Philip, will not be among the guests. A royal source said it was agreed some time ago that 92-year-old Queen Elizabeth would not attend the small, family affair. Her absence is not due to any health issues, the source confirmed.  Queen Elizabeth, the world\u0027s oldest and longest-reigning living monarch, did miss a special service last month because she was feeling under the weather but she has carried out a number of public engagements since then. The monarch is due to return to London today ahead of a busy schedule of events including the RAF Centenary event tomorrow and a meeting with US President Donald Trump on Friday. On top of this, the Queen was reportedly working flat out in Scotland last week. It would seem she is simply not attending the christening due to work commitments. Her decision not to attend was mutually agreed with William and Kate, while Philip has avoided public events - unless he really has to - since his retirement in 2017. He will remain in Norfolk this week.  Kensington Palace said William\u0027s father Prince Charles and his wife Camilla would be present along with younger brother Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle . Also attending are Kate\u0027s parents, her brother and sister and Prince Louis\u0027 six godparents , who are close friends or relatives of William and Kate. They include Kate\u0027s cousin Lucy Middleton, Nicholas van Cutsem, whose daughter was a bridesmaid at May\u0027s wedding of Harry and Meghan, and Guy Pelly, a childhood friend of William\u0027s.

Samantha Markle labelled the Duchess of Sussex the \u0027Duchess of Nonsense\u0027 and said that \u0027Diana would be ashamed\u0027. She also accused Prince Harry of bowing down to his new wife and labeled him a \u0027wuss\u0027. Harry is a wuss to allow the Duchess of Nonsense to mistreat everyone who has been close to her, especially her family.  Diana would be ashamed. Stop wearing Meg\u0027s skivvies and bra and take your pants off of her! she wrote on social media.  Samantha and her half-sister Meghan have not spoken for years and Samantha was increasingly critical of the former Suits actress in the run up to the royal wedding .  Samantha has defended their father, Thomas, after he was caught staging paparazzi photographs of him preparing for the wedding. He was unable to attend due to ill health and still has not met his new son-in-law.  In an interview last month Thomas Markle, a retired Hollywood lighting engineer, apologized for setting up the photographs and has said that he thought he was taking control of the situation by doing so. He became emotional as he said he did not think he would hear from his daughter again.  Mr Markle has been telling pals: “I haven’t talked to Meghan and Harry for a long time. I think they’re shot of me now.  “That whole situation is lost. I don’t know if we’ll ever be together again.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"wedding guest shocked ceremony interrupted","story":"NewsWedding guest shocked as ceremony interrupted by drag act singing \"It should have been me!\" as nervous grooms wait at altarThe ceremony in Glasgow at Saint Luke\u0027s Church was stunned when the singer belted out a rendition of the iconic song\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByGary Armstrong07:31, 9 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo grooms were left looking anxious at the altar after a drag act stormed down the aisle singing along to \u0027It should have been me!\u0027.

Adam Bral, 37, and his bride-to-be, Anna Lewandowska, 40, were forced to buy emergency blow-up beds for guests after The Stage Hotel, in Nottingham, unexpectedly shut up shop. Family had arrived from Poland and London for the big occasion on June 30. Mr Bral was just about to put on his suit and tie he was hit with the devastating news that the hotel he had booked for 17 guests had closed down - and they were left stranded with their suitcases outside, the Nottingham Post reports. The hotel was closed after council chiefs labelled it as a source of anti-social behaviour and crime.  A judge ordered a three-month shutdown on June 29. But this news had not reached the couple - and Mr Bral said the hotel had not warned them of the closure or reimbursed the \u0026pound355 the couple had paid in advance. Shop worker Mr Bral had to come up with a back-up plan four hours before he was about to marry the love of his life. He rang around Nottingham hotels to find a suitable alternative, but to no avail. So when this failed, he raced down to Argos to buy air beds and ended up putting the 17 guests up in his three-bedroom Bestwood home.  He told the Post: On our wedding night we had our friend\u0027s daughter who is six sleeping between us and the bridesmaid was on an air bed in the room with her husband. We had nine people in the living room and also had someone in the bath. My best man had nowhere to stay but did not want to worry me and found a hotel but paid a lot more. He claimed the hotel informed him to pay by cash in advance as it would be cheaper than booking online, but despite many calls he claimed he cannot reach the owners and get his money back.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the gang are now getting ready for the next big occasion - Prince Louis\u0027 christening . The latest royal baby has been kept out of the spotlight since he was born on April 23 at 11.01am. We got a quick look at the fifth in line to the throne as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took him home from the Lindo Wing at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in central London. But his christening will be the first time we\u0027ve seen him in public since then.  When is Prince Louis\u0027 christening taking place? The date to pop in your diary is Monday, July 9. Kensington Palace has confirmed the service will begin at 4pm and last approximately 40 minutes. Royal babies are usually christened two to three months after they\u0027re born. Prince George was born on July 22, 2013 - and was christened three months and a day later on October 23. Princess Charlotte was born on May 2, 2015 - she was christened two months and three days later on July 5. Where is Prince Louis being christened? The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will lead service, which will be held at The Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. Louis\u0027 brother George was christened at the Chapel Royal in 2013, while sister Charlotte was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Norfolk in 2015, bear the Sandringham estate. Charlotte was christened in the same church as Princess Diana, while Prince Louis is being christened in the same place as Meghan Markle, who had a private service before marrying Prince Harry.  What will Louis wear for the christening? Louis will wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by royal babies since 1841. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and was made of delicate silk and Honiton lace. The replica is made by Angela Kelly, dressmaker to the Queen. But after the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s daughter Louise in 2004 it was decided that the original gown was too delicate to be worn. The Queen\u0027s dressmaker Angela Kelly made a replica which was debuted on Louise\u0027s younger brother James in 2008. The same gown was worn by Prince George and Princess Charlotte at their christenings.  What will Kate wear to Prince Louis\u0027 christening? For Prince George\u0027s christening Kate wore a cream Alexander McQueen dress with ruffle details. For Charlotte, Kate wore the same designer for her dress and shoes. Will she wear a similar outfit to Prince Louis\u0027 christening?  Who are the godparents? Royals typically choose loads of godparents, and it is usually made up of other royals and members of the aristocracy. Louis\u0027 dad Prince William had six godparent - including former King of Greece Constantine II and Princess Alexandra, the Queen’s cousin. Prince George has seven godparents, including Earl Grosvenor, who is one of the wealthiest men in the country, and another member of the Royal family, Zara Tindall.  We now know who Louis\u0027 godparents will be: Mr. Nicholas van Cutsem - a close friend of William and Harry. William is godfather to his daughter Grace.Mr. Guy Pelly - William and Harry\u0027s best friend. Nightclub owner and entrepreneur. Mr. Harry Aubrey-Fletcher - his wedding was the first Will and Kate attend after announcing their engagment. The Lady Laura Meade - her husband, James, attending Eton with William. James is also godfather to Charlotte. Mrs. Robert Carter - Hannah Gillingham, a schoolfriend of the DuchessMiss Lucy Middleton - lawyer and Kate\u0027s cousin  Who will attend Prince Louis\u0027 christening? We now know the confirmed guest list for the christening. The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and MeghanMr. and Mrs. Michael Middleton Mr. and Mrs. James Matthews/Pippa  Mr. James MiddletonThe godparents of Prince Louis and their spouses The Queen and Prince Phillip are not attending.  Why Meghan Markle won\u0027t be godmother The Royals follow a pattern of choosing close friends and even former members of staff rather than family. Meghan, obviously falls in the latter.  When will Prince Louis\u0027 official photos be released? Princess Charlotte\u0027s official photos were released the Thursday after her christening, so expect to wait a few days. Can I watch Prince Louis\u0027 christening? The service is private, but we will have the photos and updates throughout the day here and in Mirror. Is there a reception or party after the christening? Following the service, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will give a private tea at Clarence House. Guests will be served slices of christening cake, which is a tier taken from The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding cake.  How was the christening announced? Just as they did with George and Charlotte, the royal family announced the details of the christening on Twitter. The statement said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pleased to announce that the christening of Prince Louis will take place on Monday 9th July at The Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace, London. Prince Louis will be christened by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.   Little Louis was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington on April 23. Just seven hours after he arrived Kate and Wills showed off their new arrival to the world on the hospital steps. Why Princess Charlotte\u0027s christening was in a different place Instead of Chapel Royal, Charlotte was baptised at the Church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham in July 2015. The change wasn\u0027t due to her gender, or her ranking, it was thought to be due to the church\u0027s proximity to the family\u0027s new home in Norfolk. Royal Christening traditions Royal christenings in pictures, from Edward VIII and the Queen to Princess Charlotte Why is July 9 important to the Queen? Go back 71 years and July 9 is the date her majesty, who was then Princess Elizabeth, announced she was engaged to Philip Mountbatten. Even though they were privately engaged for a year before, they didn\u0027t make it public until July 9, 1947. They made the announcement at Buckingham Palace. As is traditional in the royal family, they also released an official photo to mark the occassion. It shows Elizabeth sitting on a chair with Philip sitting on the arm, and they are staring into each others eyes looking very much in love.

Police forces across the country are being asked to record abuse and harassment of women as a hate crime - meaning sentences could be increased. Campaign groups want constabularies in England and Wales to follow the example of Nottinghamshire Police. An open letter co-signed by the Fawcett Society, civil society alliance Citizens UK, senior faith leaders and non-governmental organisations asks the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) to vote to record misogyny as a hate crime nationwide at its upcoming meeting on July 11.  Campaigners say the likes of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements highlight the need to tackle the abuse, harassment and problematic behaviour that many women are subject to, which they say can create a culture of impunity in society, leading to more severe crimes. So far only a handful of forces have followed Nottinghamshire Police\u0027s lead since it introduced the measures in 2016 - applying to incidents ranging from street harassment through to unwanted physical approaches. Helen Voce, from Nottingham Women\u0027s Centre, said: We believe misogyny is the \u0027soil\u0027 in which violence against women and girls (VAWG) grows. The same attitudes at the root of sexism and harassment are the same attitudes that drive more serious domestic and sexual violence. Classifying misogyny as a hate crime enables the police to deal robustly with the root causes of violence against women.  Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: Misogyny is so widespread it has become normalised in our society. As a result, women are routinely objectified and harassed. Unless we challenge it, this won\u0027t change. We have to start calling misogyny out for what it is - a hate crime. Sajid Mohammed, chief executive of Nottingham-based charity Himmah and a Citizens UK Council member, said: Misogynistic abuse is an everyday reality for women and the same hateful attitude which breeds Islamophobia and anti-Semitism can be directed at women because of their gender. Nationwide misogyny hate crime reporting would allow police, the public and law makers to fully understand the scale of the day-to-day abuse and harassment women face, so that we can build a society that does not tolerate hate directed against any person on the basis of their identity.

Harry Swan and Hugh Shaw are not inductees into Scotland’s Football Hall of Fame.”Rob, formerly of Lochee, Dundee, and now in Vancouver, Canada, continued: “In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hibs were Scotland’s prestigious team, winning three consecutive league titles.“They gained international attention for their fluid attacking style of play and, in 1953, were invited by the Brazil Football Association to compete in a South American competition.“The Easter Road side accepted the invitation.“Long before the ‘Fab Four’, there was the ‘Fab Five’ – and fabulous they were . . . Gordon Smith, Lawrie Reilly, Willie Ormond, Eddie Turnbull and Bobby Johnstone.“Hibs filled every ground and football fans, regardless of their allegiance, came to watch this great team play with style, panache and score great goals.“Harry Swan was Hibs chairman, and Hugh Shaw was Hibs manager during this exciting era of Scottish football. Swan was outspoken about why there should be seated stadiums for the fans.“He installed floodlights at Easter Road in 1954, when directors at Aberdeen, Celtic, the Dundee clubs, Rangers and Hearts thought floodlights were a fad.“Swan was a man of vision, and Shaw was a brilliant manager.”Football at the highest level was changing, as Rob went on: “At the end of the 1954-55 season, a Frenchman named Gabriel Hanot, ex-French international player and editor of the French Sports newspaper L’Equipe, proposed a football concept that he and his newspaper had devised.“It was to create a European Club Football Competition and would be named ‘The European Cup’.“The winning league champions from 16 European countries were invited to play home and away games during the 1955-56 season.“Aberdeen won the Scottish First Division in the 1954-55 season.“Celtic, Rangers and Hearts came next in the league, with Hibs, now past their peak, in fifth place.“Aberdeen received an invitation to enter this new European competition, but declined.“The Pittodrie board of directors didn’t fancy midweek travel to European grounds and didn’t see a future in this tournament.“The directors of Celtic, Rangers and Hearts had a similar cynicism toward this foreign folly.“Swan and Shaw, however, jumped at the opportunity to enter this European venture, and Gabriel Hanot, a long-time fan of Hibs style of play, agreed that a fifth-placed team could represent Scotland.”Other countries were also not too sure about this new venture.“In England, the FA also had misgivings about this tournament,” continued Rob.“So did Chelsea, the league champions that season, and the Stamford Bridge outfit declined the European invitation.“So Hibs were the first British team to enter a European club competition, and Eddie Turnbull was the first British player to score a goal in the European Cup.“The Hibees, past their peak, made it to the semi-final and were beaten by French side Stade de Reims.“But who won the first European Cup? Real Madrid, of course!“More than a million fans turned out to watch this European football experiment and, in the 1956-57 season, Rangers, representing Scotland, and Manchester United, representing England, accepted an invitation to play in the European Cup, which had now expanded to 22 countries.“Swan, Shaw and Hibs always took the path less travelled, and others followed in their footsteps.”“This is part of the Hall of Fame Mission statement:‘The Hall of Fame is a permanent feature in the Scottish Football Museum and will honour the truly great players, managers and officials who have reached the pinnacle of their profession and have made significant contribution to Scotland’s football reputation through their skill, spirit and determination.’“The Hibs forward line of that great team are inductees into the Hall of Fame.“The mission statement could have been scripted for Swan and Shaw.“Why are these two great football minds, who, at that time, enhanced and enriched Scotland’s reputation as a progressive football nation, not listed in Scotland’s Hall of Fame?”Rob concluded by listing “the first 16 countries to enter and play in the 1955-56 European Cup — Rapid Wien, Anderlecht, AGF Aarhus, Stade Reims, Voros Lobogo, AC Milan, PSV Eindhoven, Gwardia Warszawa, Sporting CP, Saarbrucken, Hibernian, Real Madrid, Djurgarden, Servette, Rot-Weiss Essen, Partizan.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/11/59f99e8988abd-e1509532599593-785x564.jpg ","title":"burton albion snap up ex dundee united ace scott fraser","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee United talisman Scott Fraser has joined Burton Albion.The 23-year-old has joined the English League One side on a two-year deal.Fraser had attracted interest from a host of clubs, including Hearts, but Nigel Clough has managed to secure his services.The young Dundonian left United at the end of May and revealed that he was in talks for a new deal but \u0026#8220felt a change was needed\u0026#8221.Here\u0026#39s our newest signing @ScottFraser_ in training with his new teammates!#FraserBAFC pic.twitter/moNJU7teMB\u0026mdash Burton Albion FC (@burtonalbionfc) July 5, 2018He told the Burton Albion website: \u0026#8220I’m very happy to be here.\u0026#8220When I found out what clubs might be interested this was the best feel I got and having spoken to the manager and coming down to see the ground and training facilities I think it’s a club where I can get better as a player.\u0026#8221He added: “I was coming to the end of my contract and was speaking about a new one, but I just felt a change was needed to move away, grow up and try and improve as a player.

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away.

It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me.

There’s a lot of chopping and changing.“The main thing is all the new boys that have come in are looking good. Obviously, you miss the guys who were here before and have left but that’s just football, it’s a good change.“And I’ve really enjoyed my time here, bar the end of last season, so I’m delighted to still be here and part of things. Hopefully, I can have a good season.”While it’s still early days, Stanton believes there are signs United can make it third time lucky and win promotion this term.He’s been impressed by the quality of his new team-mates and with the way the side appears to be gelling.“At Brechin the other night we came together well and we moved the ball about pretty nicely considering it was the first game.“We are pretty fit and we’re feeling good. Everyone seems to be fitting in well and that was pleasing.“The manager’s brought in a lot of good players, so it’s exciting and we’re looking forward to the season starting.“It was a good start at Brechin and, hopefully, it will get better.”Today the Tangerines were in action in a closed-door friendly at their St Andrews training base and a week today sees the Betfred Cup kick off with a group tie against Arbroath at Tannadice.While the league is the priority, Stanton’s looking forward to that.“It’s only a few weeks until the league starts up and I’m really looking forward to it.“We’ve got the Betfred Cup starting next week and that’s good. Almost all the teams use it as part of their pre-season but we want to do well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

ideas as part of the annual two-day gathering.Organisers were delighted to see the creativity spill out to the benches and gardens by the River Ness as industry leaders and those looking to progress their career exchanged ideas.The festival was staged in venues across the city but the majority of day sessions were held at Eden Court.Iain Hamilton, head of creative industries at Highlands and Islands Enterprise, said: \"Folk picked the seminars they needed to see and in between enjoyed meetings outside.\"There has been a really great turnout and most of the sessions have been very busy.\"He was also pleased to see Gaelic play such a big role in the festival line-up and applauded the translation services that opened the session up to everyone.\"The Gaelic media sector is unique and provides so many opportunities and it was great for visitors to the area to hear the seminar in Gaelic as well,\" he said.Most of the festival\u0027 emphasis was put on developing the creative industries for the future and this was highlighted with sessions such as Storytelling for 21st Century Audiences \u0026ndash with questions raised about the future of artificial intelligence and how, with using a formula, computers could one day produce stories.There was also a chance for people to enter the creative sector with sessions for those looking to get into television and music and an opportunity to mingle with leaders from across the industry.Mr Hamilton highlighted this as one of HIE\u0027 aims while planning the festival.\"It is giving access to industry leaders, showing what the trends are and what the future might be, it is also a chance for businesses to meet and see how they can work together,\" he said.\"On top of this it brings businesses to Inverness to see what we have on offer.\"The second day of the festival emphasised the importance of the creative sector and tourism industry working together to form events, films and productions that appeal to locals and tourists.The Highland Cool seminar showcased already established talent in the region such as Black Isle designer Siobhan Mackenzie and producer and songwriter Joe McAlinden.Mr Hamilton added: \"It shows that Highland businesses are at the same level \u0026ndash and can be as successful \u0026ndash as internationally based ones.\"Being based here does not hold you back.

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and

This time he returned fully fit and is clearly ready to stake a claim for a regular starting slot.Wright was impressive in the testimonial for Saints stalwart Chris Millar as he was a constant menace to the defence with his fast creative runs down the flank. The winger also got on the scoresheet as did striker Stevie May, another to produce a strong shift.In previous years, the Reds had a small window of only two to three weeks and endured a congested pre-season before their Euro opener.This summer they have five weeks to prepare for the Battle of Britain with Burnley and have packed in the friendlies.This away match at St Johnstone was the third of six friendlies that will culminate in a clash against West Brom at Pittodrie on Friday July 20.Although recently relegated from the English Premier League, the Baggies are essentially a top flight side.The real acid test of just how prepared the Reds are for the Euro campaign will be against Darren Moore’s West Brom.Aberdeen are certainly on an upwards trajectory and look sharper and fitter from that first friendly in Cork.It is all part of a slow-burning build-up to an explosive start to the campaign with Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round and Rangers in the Premiership.Boss McInnes hopes to secure a number of new signings before facing the Clarets but the squad is progressing well.At this stage in pre-season, getting that game sharpness, fitness and understanding within new additions is primary, results are secondary.There were starts for summer signings Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson as Dons boss Derek McInnes initially went with a 4-4-2 formation featuring a midfield diamond.There was a two-pronged attack of Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove while Adam Rooney, Aberdeen’s most prolific goal scorer for the last four straight seasons, was on the bench.Aberdeeen recently had a bid rejected by Doncaster for striker John Marquis.McInnes has confirmed the offer was the most the Reds could afford and that they will now look at other centrre-forward targetsin the bid to bolster the attack before the Euro clash with Burnley.St Johnstone grabbed the lead in the fifth minute when former Aberdeen skipper Richard Foster played a cross from the right into the penalty area.The delivery found David WOTHERSPOON who took one touch to control before lashing into the net beyond keeper Joe Lewis from 15 yards.It was the first goal that Aberdeen had conceded in pre-season having defeated Cobh Ramblers 1-0 in Cork and Falkirk 1-0.Aberdeen hit back in the eighth minute with a swift move down the right flank instigated by Gleeson.Midfielder Gleeson threaded a superb through ball between four Saints players to find Ferguson.The 18-year-old picked out Stevie MAY’s diagonal run into the box and the striker dinked a shot beyond keeper Zander Clark.Moments later May was again involved when he flighted in a cross from the right towards Cosgrove who flicked a header just wide of the far post from 15 yards.Aberdeen went ahead in the 27th minute through a solo goal from WRIGHT.The winger collected the ball with his back to goal some 35 yards out, he turned, then drove forward.Bursting into the box, he fired a lethal finish beyond keeper Clark from 15 yards.In the 39th minute, Drey Wright stepped wide of Mikey Devlin to open up space but curled his 22-yard wide.Rooney came on for Cosgrove at half-time and was immediately involved when he met a Wright cross but he headed just wide from the edge of the box.Moments later the impressive Ferguson curled a 25-yard effort inches wide of Clark’s near post.Ferguson plays with a maturity and game intelligence well beyond his young age and looks to be a strong addition to the squad.In the 64th minute, Considine cleared off the line as Greg Hurst got on the end of Liam Craig’s knock-down from close range.St Johnstone levelled in the 73rd minute when HURST curled an effort beyond keeper Joe Lewis into the top far corner.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Logan, Devlin, McKenna, Considine, Gleeson, Shinnie, Ferguson, Wright, May, Cosgrove.SUBS: Rooney (for Cosgrove 46), Mackay-Steven (for May 70), McGinn (for Wright 70), Ross (for Gleeson 76), Anderson (for Logan 84), Campbell (for Shinnie 87), Reynolds (for Devlin 90).

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now?

But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route. Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet.

benches, calling for EU withdrawal long before the referendum.\nAfter seeing his budding ministerial career apparently stalled when Theresa May became Prime Minister office and decided not to offer him a job, he has now been catapulted into one of the most crucial roles in her Cabinet team.\nA lawyer by training, and a black belt in karate, the fiercely ambitious 44-year-old looked set for a swift rise up the ministerial ranks after his election as MP for Tory safe seat Esher and Walton in 2010.\nBut a series of controversies held back his elevation, with Mrs May taking particular offence at his description of some feminists as \u0026ldquoobnoxious bigots in a 2011 online article in which he attacked the \u0026ldquoequality bandwagon and said that men were getting \u0026ldquoa raw deal.\nMrs May, who was then minister for equalities as well as home secretary, responded within days with a fierce slapdown in the House of Commons, telling him that his comment was \u0026ldquonot the way forward (to) get away from gender warfare.\nIn 2012, Mr Raab joined other Tory rising stars in putting his name to a manifesto called Britannia Unchained, which raised eyebrows by branding the British \u0026ldquoamong the worst idlers in the world.\nDominic Raab has long been seen as a rising star in the Conservative Party (Conservative Party/PA)\nHe was appointed civil liberties minister in the Ministry of Justice following David Cameron\u0026rsquos election victory in 2015.\nIn 2017, he was branded \u0026ldquooffensive by then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after telling a radio interviewer that \u0026ldquothe typical user of a food bank is not someone that\u0026rsquos languishing in poverty, it\u0026rsquos someone who has a cash flow problem.\nAfter a prominent role in the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, there was initially no place in Mrs May\u0026rsquos administration for Mr Raab, who was sacked from ministerial office on her arrival in power that year.\nOnce out of office, he was a co-founder of the Change Britain campaign group which kept the Leave banner flying in the years since the referendum.\nHe proved a loyal pro-Brexit outrider on the backbenches and was rewarded with a more senior role in the Ministry of Justice following last year\u0026rsquos general election, and moved to the crucial job of housing minister in January.\nDowning Street said his appointment to an area which the PM had made a personal priority showed the \u0026ldquohigh regard in which she held him.\nThe son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938, Mr Raab was brought up in Buckinghamshire and took a law degree at Oxford University before switching to Cambridge for his Master\u0026rsquos.\nHe worked as a lawyer at the Foreign Office before entering the world of politics in 2006 as an aide first to David Davis \u0026ndash the man he is now replacing \u0026ndash and then Dominic Grieve \u0026ndash the Remain-backing Tory MP who is now

school summer holidays are here and it’s easy for health routines to go out of the window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing GP, Clinical Lead at Asthma UK.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"2012s

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

welcome to this auspicious occasion, the opening of our new clubhouse.\u0026#8216We hope you agree with us that it’s a vast improvement on our previous clubhouse, built in the 1950s.\u0026#8216I would particularly like to welcome our special guest, Ailsa Stewart.\u0026#8216Mrs Stewart was asked to take over the running of the club 70 years ago in her present role as trustee.\u0026#8216Some have

regulations.\u0026#8216Jane, who unlike me, is very meticulous, reads the small print on our legal contracts with sportscotland and Tennis Scotland and advises us accordingly.\u0026#8216Gill and Jane have also raised funds this year with a quiz and raffle at various events culminating yesterday at the RNLI open day.\u0026#8216Donald, our captain, who is in California, on a number of occasions

contractors for their amazing work in transforming our club into one fit for the 21st century.\u0026#8216I would like to single out our main contractor, Gerry Nugent. Nothing was ever a problem. He was very reassuring even when we discovered the old clubhouse had no solid foundations.\u0026#8216I first became involved in the club as a 12-year-old looking to escape the house and meet up with friends.\u0026#8216My friends and I spent many hours at the courts, sometimes playing tennis, often not.\u0026#8216Mrs Dickson or Gertie, as we used to call her, was in charge in those days. She gave up so much of her time making sure the club was thriving and that we were behaving.\u0026#8216She had no hesitation in throwing us out if this wasn’t the case and I’m delighted to see Gertie’s sons, Toby and Ronnie here today.\u0026#8216Since 2014 we have raised a total of £95,000 to resurface our two courts and build the new clubhouse and ramp.\u0026#8216In two years I’ll retire from the committee and as a coach.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https://t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-prestonpans-childrens-gala-day","story":"  Gala Queen Grace Millar was crowned by Honourable Gentleman Eric Yule before leading her court to the playing fields.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7972409.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"cement-plant-says-sorry-for-cars-being-coated-in-dust","story":"  Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.

A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.

She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.  The achievement was highlighted by school interim headteacher, Lauren Rodger, in her newsletter.  She added: \u0026ldquoAnyone seeing Clara perform here at Knox will know that she is a natural percussionist and we\u0026rsquore delighted for her."},{"url":null,"title":"kit-fraser-republishes-his-dads-story-of-time-with-macbrayne","story":"  Chris Fraser\u0026rsquos autobiography Christie Boy: A MacBrayne\u0026rsquos Man was released in 1994.  Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.  Kit, 66, who previously worked as a BBC correspondent, told the Courier he had \u0026ldquohalf an idea for another book but was still considering whether to put pen to paper once again.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day. The classical music enthusiast and trumpeter has also worked on a documentary about Felix Mendelssohn and is currently working on one on Fryderyk Chopin.  Now, following his graduation, he can\u0026rsquot wait to get his documentary career under way in earnest.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhilst studying I have been coached and trained by lecturers who are well-known in the industry and it has been wonderful to benefit from their experience.  \u0026ldquoI am now in the process of sitting down with production companies, and looking forward to establishing my own name as a documentary maker.  Dr Kirsten MacLeod, course programme leader, said: \u0026ldquoMatt has been an enthusiastic and committed student who has really made the most of his time."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7892732.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"davis-resignation-an-internal-uk-matter-says-irish-minister","story":"  Michael Creed said that while the latest resignation has not helped matters, \u0026ldquopolitical instability within the British Government has been the hallmark during its internal Brexit negotiations.

A lawyer by training, and a black belt in karate, the fiercely ambitious 44-year-old looked set for a swift rise up the ministerial ranks after his election as MP for Tory safe seat Esher and Walton in 2010.  But a series of controversies held back his elevation, with Mrs May taking particular offence at his description of some feminists as \u0026ldquoobnoxious bigots in a 2011 online article in which he attacked the \u0026ldquoequality bandwagon and said that men were getting \u0026ldquoa raw deal.  Mrs May, who was then minister for equalities as well as home secretary, responded within days with a fierce slapdown in the House of Commons, telling him that his comment was \u0026ldquonot the way forward (to) get away from gender warfare.  In 2012, Mr Raab joined other Tory rising stars in putting his name to a manifesto called Britannia Unchained, which raised eyebrows by branding the British \u0026ldquoamong the worst idlers in the world.  He was appointed civil liberties minister in the Ministry of Justice following David Cameron\u0026rsquos election victory in 2015.  In 2017, he was branded \u0026ldquooffensive by then Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after telling a radio interviewer that \u0026ldquothe typical user of a food bank is not someone that\u0026rsquos languishing in poverty, it\u0026rsquos someone who has a cash flow problem.  After a prominent role in the Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, there was initially no place in Mrs May\u0026rsquos administration for Mr Raab, who was sacked from ministerial office on her arrival in power that year.  Once out of office, he was a co-founder of the Change Britain campaign group which kept the Leave banner flying in the years since the referendum.  He proved a loyal pro-Brexit outrider on the backbenches and was rewarded with a more senior role in the Ministry of Justice following last year\u0026rsquos general election, and moved to the crucial job of housing minister in January.  Downing Street said his appointment to an area which the PM had made a personal priority showed the \u0026ldquohigh regard in which she held him.  The son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938, Mr Raab was brought up in Buckinghamshire and took a law degree at Oxford University before switching to Cambridge for his Master\u0026rsquos.  He worked as a lawyer at the Foreign Office before entering the world of politics in 2006 as an aide first to David Davis \u0026ndash the man he is now replacing \u0026ndash and then Dominic Grieve \u0026ndash the Remain-backing Tory MP who is now likely to be a thorn in his side from the backbenches."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7980498.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-fans-left-empty-handed-as-touts-snap-up-tickets-for-glasgow-shows","story":"  Fans of the singer-songwriter have been left reeling after all four shows sold out in three minutes.

Four were brought to the surface on Sunday, more than two weeks after a football team and their coach were trapped underground.  The next phase of the operation will start in 10 to 20 hours, according to authorities.  Chief of operations governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said 13 foreign and five Thai divers are taking part in the operation.  The British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC) confirmed that seven divers from the UK with \u0026ldquoexpertise in cave diving are assisting.  Two elite British divers, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, were the first rescuers to reach the group on Monday night and are believed to be part of the team.  A BCRC spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe UK divers are part of the core team, so they will be actively involved and that will include escorting each child out through the flooded passage.  \u0026ldquoThe operation is being supervised by the Thai authorities.  \u0026ldquoThey have had to make a quick decision because they are really concerned about the water level rising.  Two divers will accompany each boy as they are gradually extracted.

A doctor and paramedics are standing by to provide medical attention whenever the rescue team emerges.  Rescuers pumped millions of litres of water out of the cave network to try to extract the group through nearly a mile of tunnels.  Thai officials are not only racing against worsening weather, but also lowered oxygen levels in the underground complex in the north of the country.  Former Thai navy Seal Saman Kunan passed out making the dive on Friday and died.  The boys, aged 11-16, and their coach, 25, were trapped inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai after a football game on June 23.  Monsoon flooding cut off their escape and they have been on a rocky shelf inside a cave chamber since.

Although it is now less yomping youths and more budget family hotel, half of the 72 beds are still dedicated to shared dormitories for those who like the simple charm of communal living for which the hostels are famed.  As it nears its 9th decade, the organisation that runs the 34 Scottish hostels undertaken a name-change - from the Scottish Youth Hostels Association to Hostelling Scotland - which was executed this year.  Research showed that while older people used and still use or are rediscovering hostelling, younger people understood the concept less.  Glen Nevis is part of the resulting overhaul that includes developing gems like its hostel on the edge of Loch Ossian, renovation of Lochranza on Arran and could also include expansion with new properties including in St Andrews.  Wardens are also consigned to history, with managers there in their place and new apprenticeships are being developed to help bring in young staff.    Margo Paterson, Hostelling Scotland chief executive, said the evolution will continue as the organisation settles into its new identity.  She said: \"This major redevelopment project truly reflects our commitment to the modernisation of our accommodation network.  \"It also highlights our mission to make more of Scotland more accessible to more people than anyone else, and especially young people, providing great value, affordable, flexible and welcoming accommodation in the best locations across Scotland.\"  She said:\u0026nbsp\"We pride ourselves in excellent customer service, listening to our members and guests, understanding their needs and developing our network to offer the best possible hostelling experience.  \"The new Glen Nevis Youth Hostel, one of our flagship hostels, highlights this perfectly. We want guests to discover the real Scotland with us.\"  She said removing the word youth from their title did not reflect a move away from core customers and schemes to help groups of young people embark on rural adventures are also under way.  The \u0026pound6 membership and guest overnight income supports its charitable youth programmes and the maintenance of the hostelling network.  Following the strategic review of the organisation early in 2018, the 88-year-old hostelling association said: \"The new identity follows on from extensive marketing research and reflects the organisation\u0026rsquos commitment to understanding the needs of its members, guests and employees as the modern face of Scottish Hostelling.  \"The name also more clearly indicates its representation of Hostelling International within Scotland.\"  The 34 Hostelling Scotland hostels is about half of the number hostels from a decade ago, but it attracts 380,000 guests every year, with a turnover of \u0026pound9m and an estimated contribution to the Scottish visitor economy of \u0026pound25m.

He does not know this yet. But one day, for a time, he will be the most-feared centre-forward in Europe and arguably the best header of a football ever.  Today sports scientists would call this practice something highfalutin such as \u0026lsquomarginal gains activity\u0026rsquo but Alan Gilzean was merely following the instructions of his dad, Willie, who had told him that to make it as a footballer he would have to put in the effort, and thereupon tied a ball to a rafter in his painter-and-decorator shop.  There was no stinting from the young Alan. When he had finished a set he would shorten the rope and start again. The other scouts would try it but none of them could reach the heights that Gilzean could. Of all the stories about Alan Gilzean that stood out for me when I first started writing a book about him in early 2009, it was this tale of self-sacrifice that appealed to me most.  Granted, I had decided to embark on the project upon hearing rumours that the former Dundee, Tottenham Hotspur and Scotland striker had fallen on hard times and was living as a down and out in England\u0026rsquos West Country, so there were more sensational tales to investigate, but it was this one that tickled me most.  It spoke of a different era \u0026ndash of more quaint, homespun times. I wanted to restore some of his faded lustre, to earn him recognition from the Scottish football hall of fame, to help him find a way back to White Hart Lane where he had not visited for the best part of four decades.  This snapshot of the past was a portent of things to come, too. The central defenders of Sporting Clube, Cologne, Anderlecht and AC Milan could all attest to that.  When Dundee marched to the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1962, Gilzean was chief tormentor, the main man, the striker the continent\u0026rsquos best feared. His nine goals during that run were second only to Altafini\u0026rsquos 14, yet the Milan striker had enjoyed the luxury of an eight-goal haul against no-hopers Union Luxembourg in the preliminary round.  As one of my late dad\u0026rsquos favourites, Gilzean \u0026lsquothe King of White Hart Lane\u0026rsquo was a part of my childhood. I wanted to ask him what it was like to run out at Wembley wearing the colours of Tottenham, and go on to lift the cup with the club I had supported all my life. I wanted to know about his Scotland days, that goal against England at Hampden. I had hundreds of questions: Did the scout hut and the boxing glove help him to become the finest proponent of the flicked header in English football? What happened to his life afterwards? And how did he feel when he finally returned to White Hart Lane after a 38-year absence?  But, mostly, I just wanted to be in his company, to drink in his words. I only got to speak to him six times, so fiercely private was he that he once claimed only seven people in the UK had his telephone number. Ever the gent, we remained on friendly terms even if he was uncomfortable with having his name in lights again.  As I sit here attempting to write the hardest piece I have ever written, I can\u0026rsquot adequately express what I feel. How can I do justice in 800 words to a man I wrote 120,000 about?  Thumbing through my book I\u0026rsquom trying to find a suitable homily among a litany of tributes and the best I can come up with is this from Jimmy Greaves, his erstwhile strike partner at Spurs. \u0026ldquoWe became the G-Men, we read each other\u0026rsquos mind, said Greaves. \u0026ldquoHe was the greatest I played with.  And then this from the book\u0026rsquos conclusion: \u0026ldquoHe was ahead of his time and if he had not always received the credit for it when he was a player, there seemed to be a dawning realisation on a personal level that what he had given to football was worth remembering. But this was not confined just to Gillie. In the aftermath of [an STV programme on Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest team], numerous friends and colleagues approached me to say that they had had no real grasp of just how brilliant Gilzean had been. And that said everything one needed to know about whether his legacy had been restored or not.  The King is dead but his name will echo for generations to come. Long live the King.

There were Saltires hanging above the bar, and a raucous crowd that erupted in cheers when John Collins scored a penalty to level the game against the reigning champions.  The pub was in York the audience was largely English.  Growing up in northern England, it never occurred to me not to support Scotland, or any of the home nations. Why wouldn\u0026rsquot I?  Unless we were playing each other, of course.  I am a passionate England fan it was Italia \u0026rsquo90 that hooked me. I couldn\u0026rsquot watch the Egypt game live so I recorded it on VHS and watched it in full when I got home. I watched the Cameroon quarter final \u0026ndash the last time England won at that level before Saturday - on a black-and-white TV in my aunt\u0026rsquos farmhouse, and was allowed to stay up late to watch the West Germany semi-final on a tiny TV in my bedroom, before crying myself to sleep.  The first poster on my bedroom wall was of Gary Lineker I\u0026rsquoll never forget watching Gazza play against Sweden at Elland Road in the Umbro tournament in 1995 I had to be picked up off the floor outside a Corfu bar in 1998 because I was inconsolable when Argentina knocked us out on penalties in the knockout stages.  Then, perhaps unwisely for such a diehard England fan, I moved to Scotland.  England\u0026rsquos next tournament game was in Euro 2000, against Portugal. I watched it in a bar in Edinburgh and it was my first real experience of the Anyone But England (ABE) phenomenon.  When Portugal came back from 2-0 down to win the game, the cheers and cries of \"sunny Portugal, we\u0026rsquoll support you ever more\" were deafening.  For someone who grew up in England, yet always supported Scotland, it stunned me. I simply wasn\u0026rsquot prepared for the animosity. I was bitter and upset.  But that was then this is now. Nearly two decades on, I get it, and I revel in it. It\u0026rsquos a footballing rivalry and it\u0026rsquos a healthy one. I even felt comfortable enough to watch last year\u0026rsquos Scotland v England game in the home end at Hampden.  I watched England\u0026rsquos World Cup game against Panama in an Edinburgh bar. There were fans in England tops bellowing out \"It\u0026rsquos Coming Home\", while others cheered Panama\u0026rsquos consolation goal as if it had been scored by Leigh Griffiths himself. It was a cracking atmosphere, with no hint of tension.  Traditionally, of course, it\u0026rsquos the ABE crowd which has more fun. Like the time Frank Lampard\u0026rsquos goal against Germany was disallowed and we went on to lose 4-1. Or the time Portugal knocked us out on penalties. Correction: times, plural.  The pain of defeat has hurt over the years, but boy is this tournament is making up for it.  Every two years the same debate takes place: should Scots support the Auld Enemy?  There are those who insist Scots should back England, arguing that to do otherwise is embarrassing. I\u0026rsquom not one of them \u0026ndash it makes victory even sweeter for us.  There are those \u0026ndash mainly politicians \u0026ndash who pick another team for spurious reasons. The correct choice for politicians whose nation is not playing is that they\u0026rsquore not supporting anyone, precisely because their nation is not playing.  And there are those who watch every England game in the hope of a humiliating defeat for the Three Lions.  This contingent is smaller than in previous years, and some put that down to the humility of Gareth Southgate and his young squad. Yet perhaps a bigger reason is we now have a generation of Scotland fans who have never known qualification for a major tournament, making rooting for England\u0026rsquos opponents all the more futile.  In the binary world of post-indyref Scotland, where everyone is forced to be a Unionist or a Nationalist, it is inevitable that politics poisons the football debate.  In a newspaper column last week, the pro-independence columnist Lesley Riddoch wrote: \u0026ldquoAs Scotland finds its new place in the North Atlantic and the league of small, energy-rich European states, our age-old enmity with England will become utterly irrelevant.  Completely failing to understand that the enmity is to do with a footballing rivalry, not the constitution, does she actually think independence involves sawing along the border and allowing Scotland to float off in the direction of Iceland?  She added: \u0026ldquoOne day, football and the constitutional question in Scotland will be equally disconnected.  It always has been, Lesley, and it\u0026rsquos only fanatical nationalists who make it otherwise.  Among real fans, there is no link between constitutional preference and support or otherwise for England. Some of the most vociferous ABE backers I know are diehard Tories.  It is perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to be part of the UK and to want England to be crushed on the football pitch. It\u0026rsquos also perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to leave the UK and to want England to win on the football pitch.  Or any combination of the above: there are no strict rules.  You don\u0026rsquot get much more passionate about independence than the SNP\u0026rsquos former Westminster leader Angus Robertson, who tweeted this week: \u0026ldquoAbsolutely delighted for England, all English fans, friends and relations. Congratulations.  Oh how the SNP misses him in the Commons.  It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine Angus would have resorted to such petty antics as his successor Ian Blackford and colleagues did last week, when they repeatedly dawdled through the voting lobby and ensured English MPs and Commons staff missed the Colombia game.  A healthy rivalry should not involve sabotage. Just imagine if Scotland had qualified for the tournament and English MPs pulled the same stunt during a crunch match.  So it\u0026rsquos the semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. Nearly three decades since the last time England reached this stage. Just like Gazza in Turin, it\u0026rsquoll probably end in tears.  But maybe, just maybe, Southgate\u0026rsquos men really are going to bring football home. After all those penalty defeats, all the failures of the \"golden generation\", all the crushed dreams, what absolute joy that will bring me \u0026ndash and what pain it will bring for so many Scotland fans.  I absolutely can\u0026rsquot wait."},{"url":null,"title":"melissa-george-tough-girl-who-told-weinstein-he-looked-ridiculous","story":"  You should try it, she says. I\u0026rsquom not sure I have the equipment, Melissa. Nor the nipple tassels.  Melissa George is an Australian actor who lives in Paris, who once upon a time appeared in Home And Away and these days works alongside Sean Penn and Gabriel Byrne. You will have seen her in films such as Mulholland Drive or The Amityville Horror or Derailed, or maybe on TV in Friends or Grey\u0026rsquos Anatomy.  She is funny, earthy (see above), outspoken (see below) and lives in France, where she is a single mother of two boys. It\u0026rsquos Friday afternoon, and she got off the plane from Paris only a couple of hours ago and here we are in the Caledonian Hotel, Edinburgh, discussing the techniques of burlesque dancing.  The reason is her new film The Butterfly Tree, which is receiving its UK premiere at the Edinburgh International Festival a few hours after we speak. It\u0026rsquos an Australian movie about grief and desire and illness and flowers, roller skating and, yes, nipple tassels.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never seen a burlesque dancer with nipple tassels on roller skates and butterfly wings, George points out. Watch The Butterfly Tree and you will see George tackling all of the above. \u0026ldquoThis is not easy.  I know I made it look easy, but it\u0026rsquos not easy.  I think that we nailed it.  Making the film in Queensland, Australia, she says was one of the happiest experiences of her life. She travelled with her two sons, the youngest only a few months old.  \u0026ldquoI was obviously still feeding my son, she points out. \u0026ldquoNot many mothers after giving birth get to play a burlesque dancer with barely nothing on. I love stuff like that when you\u0026rsquore personally stretched and professionally stretched at the same time.  The film gives George a chance to channel her inner Blanche DuBois goes disco. She plays a former burlesque dancer turned florist who brings a little bit of sunshine into the life of a widower and his teenage son while hiding her own secrets.  It\u0026rsquos a movie about the male gaze made by a female director, Priscilla Cameron. George\u0026rsquos character Evelyn is a woman who has been looked at all her life. \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos every reason for it in a way, George points out. \u0026ldquoWomen are beautiful. They are shaped beautifully.  Born in Perth, western Australia, in 1976, these days George\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoStrine has the faintest hint of a French flavour in the speaking. She seems very at home in Paris. Last night, she tells me, she had dinner with the French film director Leos (Holy Motors) Carax. \u0026ldquoWe meet once a week at the same restaurant. We have the same meal and just talk about updates of the week. I adore him.  \u0026ldquoBeing in Paris opens you to all sorts of places and people.  And yet, anyone with a passing interest in George will know that life in the French capital has not been easy of late. George has come through a bitter custody dispute over her two sons with her ex-partner Jean David, founder of AlloCine.  The couple now share custody, which is why George has to stay in Paris. What\u0026rsquos the shape of life in 2018, I ask her?  \u0026ldquoThe shape of life doesn\u0026rsquot have a shape. There\u0026rsquos no shape. What\u0026rsquos the shape for me?  I wake up in the morning, put my feet on the floor, take a deep breath, look at my phone. Any fires to put out? No? Ooh, it\u0026rsquos going to be a good morning. Go for lunch, look at the phone again. Any fires to put out? Yes. Not such a good afternoon. It\u0026rsquos like that.  But George, who was previously married to the Chilean film director Claudio Dabed, says she is beginning to find her feet again. \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a great feeling.  \u0026ldquoAnd, you know, if you want to treat yourself to life you go to Paris anyway, don\u0026rsquot you? I\u0026rsquom reminding myself of that every day.  Work is looking up, too. She recently shot a new TV series, The First, in New Orleans with Sean Penn and she\u0026rsquos still buzzing about it. \u0026ldquoI got to work with my idol and every day he gave me everything he had, absolutely everything he had.  It was on the set of The First, too, that she first started noticing the impact of the #MeToo movement. \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquore not so sexualised any more on set, she says. \u0026ldquoA lot of the male crew are a lot politer. Everything is kind of shifting and it\u0026rsquos also making women have a lot more respect for themselves too. Time\u0026rsquos for us now. We have to make the most of it and we have to step it up a little bit too.  We have to talk about Harvey Weinstein. The Hollywood producer who last month pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and criminal sex act charges in New York. Leading actresses, including Romola Garai and Kate Beckinsale, have accused Weinstein of arranging business meetings in hotels with them and turning up to find him dressed only in a bathrobe.  George made three films with Weinstein, including The Amityville Horror remake and Derailed. What she remembers is just how important he once was.  \u0026ldquoWhen I had meetings with Harvey Weinstein it was like \u0026lsquoOh my God if I don\u0026rsquot impress Harvey in this breakfast meeting I\u0026rsquom not going to get the movie.\u0026rsquo That\u0026rsquos how we used to think. Now it\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoIf I\u0026rsquom not a great actress and a respectable woman and human being I\u0026rsquom not going to get the role\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoBut I remember being at the Peninsula [hotel] shaking because I was about to meet Harvey Weinstein.  \u0026ldquoI was an Australian tough girl and have seen Harvey so many times. He\u0026rsquos always been so respectful, always a gentleman always very kind because I give off the energy to him that I\u0026rsquom not going to accept anything otherwise.  That said, after one meeting she believes she was demoted from the lead female role in Derailed to that of the wife, with Jennifer Aniston drafted in to take the role she had originally.  Still, she says, \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove never had anything but pleasant experiences with that man. But I know why. It\u0026rsquos because I showed him that\u0026rsquos the way it\u0026rsquos going to be.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no excuse for what he\u0026rsquos done and it\u0026rsquos no excuse for the way he manipulated certain women into doing certain things but in my case ... I just remember saying: \u0026lsquoyou look ridiculous with what you\u0026rsquore wearing.\u0026rsquo Suddenly the penny drops. Hold on, Melissa, sorry, I say, what he was wearing?  \u0026ldquoWell, we know what he wears.  A bathrobe? \u0026ldquoYes, so I remember saying: \u0026lsquoYou look ridiculous and I hope I leave the meeting with the lead in Amityville Horror\u0026rsquo.  This is Melissa George the tough Australian girl speaking. I am beginning to see how tough.  \u0026ldquoI had nothing but very good experiences with Harvey, she repeats. \u0026ldquoBut I know it\u0026rsquos got a lot to do with how I handled the situation. I\u0026rsquom not a #MeToo.  The Butterfly Tree is in cinemas from Friday."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8041789.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tribute-to-greatest-test-pilot-can-help-youngsters-dreams-take-off","story":"  Now Captain Eric \u0026ldquoWinkle Brown is to be honoured with the creation of a flying scholarship in his name for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Two years after he died at the age of 97, the most decorated pilot in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) has been permanently honoured with a statue at Edinburgh Airport, his old base.  And there are additional plans for a more far-reaching memorial to the Leith-born aviator, with the scholarship being considered by a group of former pilots connected to his old university.    Eric Brown in a Wildcat, one of the 487 different types of aircraft he flew \u0026ndash a world record  The ex-pilots from the Edinburgh University Air Squadron Association (EUASA) got together to raise the funds for the life-sized bronze statue of Captain Brown, by Scottish sculptor David Annand.  Now Dr Hamish Macleod, chairman of EUASA, said the squadron also wants to put the scholarship in place to allow young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to access light aircraft flying.  He said: \u0026ldquoWinkle was not only a man who loved to fly, but he also inspired a generation of pilots with his modest good humour and outstanding courage. The statue of him outside Edinburgh Airport will give the many thousands of passengers the opportunity to reflect on this Scottish hero who can inspire us all.  \u0026ldquoWinkle\u0026rsquos legacy can also bring a life-changing experience to today\u0026rsquos youngsters assisting them to learn to fly, or simply experiencing the thrill of flying in small aircraft.  The squadron raised \u0026pound50,000 for the statue and are bidding to raise a further \u0026pound50,000 to set up scholarships, with the estimated cost to achieve solo flying standard being \u0026pound3,000.  Captain Brown\u0026rsquos own flying experience started with a bumpy but exhilarating ride in his father\u0026rsquos First World War Royal Flying Corps bi-plane, which sowed the seed of ambition in an eager eight-year-old.  He learned to fly himself at the earliest opportunity he could after leaving Fettes College as a student at Edinburgh University, which was an RAF recruitment route.    Prince Andrew unveiled statue of Captain Eric Brown  During his early adventures, he saw Hitler\u0026rsquos oratory at the 1936 Berlin Olympics with his father and at one stage in his life managed to sing with the Glenn Miller band.  He became a British Royal Navy officer after training at RAF Turnhouse, now Edinburgh Airport, in the late 1930s and came to be affectionately called Winkle, short for periwinkle, by his friends because of his physical stature.  His most amazing achievements were in his role as a Royal Navy test pilot, during which he pioneered the perfecting of breakneck aircraft carrier deck landings.  Captain Brown holds the world record for flying the greatest number of different types of aircraft, a total of 487, which is a feat unlikely to be rivalled. The highly-decorated pilot also holds the world record for landings on aircraft carriers, at 2,407, and for take-offs on aircraft carriers, at 2,721.  Also in action, he used his language skills to interview Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering, and was among those who liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.  He flew home a rocket-powered enemy aircraft, a Messerschmitt Me 163B-1a Komet, back to Britain from Germany after the aircraft was captured in 1945.    Sir John Elvidge, chairman of Edinburgh Airport, said: \u0026ldquoCaptain Eric \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo Brown is a someone who is synonymous with RAF Turnhouse and, in turn, a key figure in the history of what is now Edinburgh Airport.  \u0026ldquoHis achievements speak for themselves and the fact his remarkable career is still held in such high regard after all these years is testament to the man himself.  \u0026ldquoWe are proud of the connection between Edinburgh Airport and the RAF and we want people to share that by learning about this truly inspiring man who served his country with great honour, and this statue is a small token of thanks to him and his legacy.  The statue to honour Leith-born Captain Brown was unveiled at Edinburgh Airport by the Duke of York, who himself served as a pilot in the Royal Navy for almost 20 years and now holds the rank of Vice Admiral.  The pilot has also received high praise from British astronaut Tim Peake who when he died tweeted a tribute from the International Space Station saying Capt Brown was \u0026ldquoto my mind the greatest test pilot who has ever lived.  First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, said when Captain Brown died that he was one of the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos greats.  Paying tribute after his death, he said: \u0026ldquoThe Fleet Air Arm may have lost one of its finest and best-known pilots, but British aviation has lost something even greater \u0026ndash the most accomplished test pilot of his generation and perhaps of all time, and a huge advocate of military aviation.  His family said in a statement released after his death: \u0026ldquoEric was the most decorated pilot of the Fleet Air Arm, in which service he was universally known as \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo on account of his diminutive stature.  \u0026ldquoHe also held three absolute Guinness World Records, including for the number of aircraft carrier deck landings and types of aeroplane flown."},{"url":null,"title":"island-vigil-for-alesha-macphail","story":"  Local people gathered to light candles for the six-year-old in Rothesay\u0026rsquos Guildford Square on Sunday evening.

The initiatives included in the Government\u0026rsquos Road to Zero Strategy include more money to fund charging infrastructure and the need to assess whether new homes and offices should be required to install charge points as standard.  The strategy calls for new street lighting columns on UK roads with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations.  The Government is also expected to outline more details of its ban on sales of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040.  Alternatively-fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and pure electrics held just 5.5% of the UK\u0026rsquos new car market in the first six months of the year, compared with 4.2% during the same period in 2017.  Launching the Government\u0026rsquos plans to boost take-up of the technology, Mr Grayling will say: \u0026ldquoThe Road to Zero Strategy, combined with the measures we\u0026rsquove already introduced, will mean Britain now has one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world.  \u0026ldquoWe want the UK to become the best country in the world in which to develop and manufacture zero-emission vehicles.  \u0026ldquoThe prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to \u0026pound7.6 trillion by 2050.  A study for motoring research charity the RAC Foundation found that growth in electric car use could be stalled by limitations in the public charging network.  The mass market appeal of ultra-green vehicles may be restricted without widespread, reliable and easy-to-use charging points, the report warned.  Separate AA research shows that eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block for them to buy an electric vehicle.  The motoring firm\u0026rsquos president Edmund King said: \u0026ldquoA big push on a range of slow, fast and rapid charging points should help overcome this hurdle.  \u0026ldquoThe challenge is then for manufacturers to make a car worth buying.  \u0026ldquoThese Road to Vision Zero proposals are a step in the right direction but there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars."},{"url":null,"title":"what-we-know-about-the-amesbury-nerve-agent-emergency","story":"  The same type of chemical weapon was used in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia\u0026nbspin Salisbury in March.  \u0026ndash What has happened?

He said the Government had gone further than it should have in the negotiations, in a \"dangerous strategy\".

Blair Nimmo and Geoff Jacobs of KPMG LLP were appointed as joint administrators on Wednesday last week.                                                    The privately-owned firms operate two service lines from their headquarters in Huntly, comprising the development of private residential homes – mainly in Aberdeenshire – and the provision of design and build contracts for housing associations across the north of Scotland.        Five of the firms’ 14 employees have been made redundant with immediate effect, while the remaining employees have been retained to assist the administrators to realise the companies’ assets, including four sites currently being developed in Peterhead, Burntisland, Keith and Kemnay and Peterhead.Deveron Homes was established in 2002 and the construction arm was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.                                                                                                        Blair Nimmo commented: “Deveron Homes and Deveron Construction are well-known businesses in the North East and provide a significant source of employment in Huntly through the construction supply chain. Disappointingly, market conditions and contract delays have required both businesses to cease trading. \"We will do everything we can to seek a buyer who may be able to protect the businesses and maximise recoveries for creditors.“The firms have an integrated infrastructure together with a property portfolio and various ongoing contracts. We would encourage any party who has an interest in acquiring both the businesses and assets to contact us as soon as possible.“We will be working with employees and relevant government agencies to ensure the full range of support is available to all those affected.”                                                                                                        Anyone with an interest in buying the assets of the company should contact Geoff Jacobs on 01224 591000 or write to KPMG LLP, 37 Albyn Place, Aberdeen, AB10 1JB.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Monday 9 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal.

It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not!

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Monday 9 Jul 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765906.1531125482!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith brexit no longer means brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Theresa May has betrayed those 17.4 million who voted for Brexit with her latest plan, writes Brian Monteith                Well, does Brexit now mean Brexit? Does the Prime Minister’s Cabinet agreement on a negotiating position – more than two years after the British people voted to leave the European Union – amount to a craven capitulation or a triumph of pragmatism in the face of the EU’s intransigence?             The test must surely be to examine the proposal against what Theresa May has repeatedly told us, namely we shall be leaving the EU’s single market and customs union, we shall be controlling our own borders and we shall be free from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. In other words, by regaining full sovereignty the UK will take back control.            The press statement that summarised the Prime Minister’s proposal, which will form the basis of a White Paper, has been examined by barrister Martin Howe, QC, a respected specialist in European law and adviser to Lawyers for Britain – and it has been found seriously wanting.His 18-page advice can be found at their website and is well worth a read but the telling phrase is this: “These proposals [therefore] lead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU’s legal and regulatory tar pit, still has to obey EU laws and ECJ rulings across vast areas, cannot develop an effective international trade policy or adapt our economy to take advantage of the freedom of Brexit, and has lost its vote and treaty veto rights as an EU member state.”• READ MORE: David Davis resignation plunges government into crisisTo achieve unanimity around her proposal, the Prime Minister connived against her colleagues who have repeatedly given her the benefit of the doubt only to find that decisions taken in good faith on issues such as the single market and customs union are consistently reopened to be debated again.Consider this: Mrs May flew to Germany to reveal her proposal to Chancellor Angela Merkel before she had presented it to her own Cabinet in an attempt to obtain pre-approval. It is generally held that the EU was also given wind of what she was proposing and was asked not to dismiss it out of hand before any negotiations.             The Cabinet members were then given the 120-page document to read individually only two hours before their meeting started and had their phones and watches taken off them so they could not communicate details of the contents or the meeting. Meanwhile, civil servants behind the plan were leaking details of the proceedings as if they were commenting gleefully on Eurovision Song Contest entries.That a Prime Minister should seek to cut a deal behind the backs of her own Cabinet betrays that she is not negotiating for the best deal from the EU but on the contrary, is negotiating together with the EU against Brexiteers in the Cabinet who represent the 17.4 million that voted Leave. If that is not treachery I don’t know what is. What we are heading for is not a soft Brexit, as its supporters are portraying it, but a soft Remain that will in time become a hard Remain – for it will undoubtedly result in further concessions. The Prime Minister’s Chequers agreement is only her opening gambit and, by the example of her performance thus far, must mean further concessions along the way.To consider what May has done let us look at it from a Scottish context. Imagine Scotland voted to leave the UK in a second independence referendum, but in the negotiations for a new relationship with the UK the SNP Cabinet is divided because some fear a soft Indyref will tie Scotland forever to decisions by UK institutions such as Westminster, the Bank of England and UK Supreme Court. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon quietly jets down to London, meets the UK Prime Minister of the day and reveals the plans she will present to her Scottish Cabinet before they are able to read it and agree to it. Sturgeon, with the promise of no more than murmurings from the UK that it is only a good starting-point, comes home and threatens the collapse of the government and an early election if she doesn’t get her way.            That is what May has done, and it is nothing short of treacherous to the decision that was taken on 23 June, 2016 by the British people – and it is not even the final settlement. No matter how sweet-sounding its initial reaction, the EU will bargain for more.  One has to conclude that if May had shown as much cunning and sharp practice towards the EU and Michel Barnier as she has shown to her Cabinet members then she would have undoubtedly have won greater support and loyalty from those who have put their faith in her, only to be betrayed.As is the way of politics I doubt we have heard the last of this shameful episode in the Conservative Party’s history. Too many are looking to their ministerial careers, their superannuated pensions, their limousine lifestyle and ambitions. David Davis was meant to be the minister for exiting the European Union but has become the doormat for the Prime Minister’s kitten heels. On Friday she trod all over him, again. Boris Johnson fires off smart-ass one-liners like torpedoes, but they have ultimately turned back and sunk him, for he is finished as an alternative to May if he can’t do a Heseltine and storm out. Meanwhile, Liam Fox is on a mission to irrelevance who will want to discuss trade deals in any serious fashion with him now? Michael Gove was apparently the first Leaver in Cabinet to support May’s plan if true then he has excelled himself as the most duplicitous of all having stabbed Boris Johnson in the back during the Tory leadership election on the basis he would not have delivered Brexit, he has now knifed the Brexit movement completely.            Left isolated, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey have capitulated with their colleagues. Only a number of backbenchers, certainly too few if Labour backs May’s proposal, are wisening up to what it means.A Survation poll, carried out since the announcement, suddenly puts Labour ahead with the Tories dropping three points. It is only the beginning. The Cabinet may be united for the moment, but are all holding hands as they jump off an electoral cliff into that dark tarry black hole they are being warned about.• Brian Monteith is a director of Global Britain"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765653.1530992976!/image/image.jpg","title":"euan mccolm laws governing eu referendum proved meaningless","story":"        Without a criminal sanction or  the threat of a re-run, Vote Leave can cock a snook at the Electoral Commission, says Euan McColm                Imagine you’re unhappy with your television. The screen’s too small, the sound’s terrible and, frankly, nobody much enjoyed watching that last match round at your place.            There’s only one thing for it: you’re going to have to shell out a couple of grand on a new one.            Unfortunately, you’ve already spent the last of your savings on lottery tickets and artisan gin so the need for a TV simply cannot be met with the \u2028resources you have available. So what do you do?You could do the right thing and save a bit, maybe buy a new flat-screen next year, or you could, I suppose, stroll confidently into John Lewis, unhook a fancy Sony from the wall and march out with it under your arm.And, if a security guard stopped you by the front door, you could try explaining that it was the will of the people that you had a new TV.You wouldn’t do that, though, would you? There’s a law against you stealing things, even when you really, really want them. If you get caught in the act, you don’t get to keep your ill-gotten gains, you get to visit your local police station and you get to have a criminal record that might well ruin your life.Steal a referendum result, on the other hand, and – even if you get caught – you get to keep your winnings.            READ MORE: Official Brexit campaign ‘broke electoral law’Last week, the Vote Leave campaign, which celebrated victory in the 2016 EU referendum, leaked news that the Electoral Commission was set to find it breached electoral law during the Brexit referendum.In what appeared to be an effort to take back control of this particular story, this particular group of  Brexiteers let it be known that the commission had accused them of breaking their official spending limit of £7 million by passing donations to another campaign group – BeLeave – with which it was allegedly co-ordinating operations.If, indeed, Vote Leave did break electoral law during the campaign, one might be forgiven for expecting that there would be some pretty serious consequences.             After all, ignoring the law in order to win a referendum that will change the course of British history might be considered a more serious matter than half-inching a telly.If the law on spending limits – put in place (and here’s a laugh) to stop the wealthy simply buying victories – really meant anything, there would be police involvement. As it is, this piece of civil, rather than criminal, law is utterly worthless.The toughest sanction available to the electoral commission is the imposition of a fine of up to £20,000. To a millionaire campaigner willing to ignore the law, that might seem like very good value indeed.The spin from pro-Brexit politicians, campaigners, and commentators is that none of this had any impact on the result of the referendum a majority would have voted Leave, regardless of the amount any of the participants had spent. If this is so, one wonders why they felt the need to spend anything on the campaign at all.Remainers hoping that the Electoral Commission’s findings might have some impact on the result are to be disappointed.             It’s no wonder Vote Leave was so relaxed about revealing some of the detail of its own alleged misdeeds.But this scandal – and it is a bloody scandal, regardless of how it might be dismissed by the braying Brexiteers of Little England – should have consequences for future elections and referendums. It is time for spending on campaigns to be a matter of criminal rather than civil law.I fear, however, that we will see little appetite for this necessary change from the main political parties.It is an open secret that participants in elections regularly ignore the rules and regulations that are supposed to ensure financial fair play. As one campaigner put it to me last week: “We all do it and nobody wants to make an issue of it. If we start throwing accusations at our opponents, they’ll start throwing accusations at us. Everyone’s hands are dirty.”This cosy, all-in-the-sewer-together understanding makes a mockery of already toothless legislation surrounding spending limits.An especially bleak irony of the electoral commission’s findings, as leaked by Vote Leave, is that the Brexit campaign was driven by a populist message that departure from the EU would empower those who felt left behind by “political elites” or “the establishment” when the reality, it appears, is that the only people truly empowered by it are a financial elite whose contempt for the law (for what it is currently worth, which is nothing) is out there in the open, now, for all to see.When those who value “Britishness” talk about what it actually means, they will tell you that they pride themselves on our collective sense of fair play.If those Brexiteers who made so much about British values during the 2016 campaign truly meant what they say, they would be clamouring for a re-run of the referendum. A result obtained by murky means, with the law ignored, is surely fundamentally un-British, isn’t it?Anyone who dares to question the validity of a victory secured by a campaign that broke electoral law should expect to be dismissed as an out-of-touch “Remoaner”. The rag-bag of libertarians, right-wing obsessives, and downright racists who are currently pushing for Brexit at any cost will have their way.I can’t see any good reason that anyone – regardless of their political position – would oppose turning the regulation of campaign funding from a civil to a criminal matter. After all, don’t we all want to ensure the high standards politicians talk about to be a reality rather than just another bit of meaningless spin?The EU referendum result will have consequences for generations to come. Those who secured that victory may consider themselves very fortunate indeed that the law governing the way the referendum was conducted is meaningless."},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment brexit s true impact on our national health service","story":"        DURING 2016\u0026#8217s referendum on EU membership, those arguing most passionately in favour of a Leave vote were adamant that one of the main beneficiaries would be the National Health Service.                Without the need to pay for membership of the European club, went the argument, the UK could invest £350million-a-week in the NHS. Campaigners making this entirely dubious claim went so far as to emblazon it on the side of a bus, a cynical but effective move that helped perpetuate what The Scotsman regards as the myth that membership of the EU represented a drag on the UK economy.            The truth is that Brexit is set to have major impact on the health service but not in the positive way Leavers insisted.            It will not have escaped the attention of anyone who has used the NHS in recent years that it depends for the maintenance of acceptable standards upon the services of a great many staff who are not UK citizens.Uncertainty over the status of these staff post Brexit should be a matter of the gravest concern for us all.Gung-ho hardline Brexiteers may argue that the UK should walk away from the EU without any kind of deal. We believe this to be a dangerously reckless approach.A new report makes clear that a no-deal Brexit would impact on staffing not to just in hospitals but beyond.The social care sector - providing nursing and support services to the elderly and disabled in their own homes - currently employs 10,000 EU nationals in Scotland.            These staff are now living under a dark cloud of uncertainty while Eurosceptics across the political spectrum flex their muscles and demand that the “will of the people” be satisfied, no matter what.We do not believe it was the will of those people who voted Leave to bring the health and social care sectors to their knees.Prime Minister Theresa May has, in recent days, begun to show a little more steel in her dealings with the Eurosceptics in her party. While she is in this frame of mind, we hope she will take the necessary step of making clear that, whatever form Brexit takes, health and care workers who have devoted themselves to building careers here will be welcome to remain and that she will not prevent employers from bringing in more workers if necessary."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765145.1531123829!/image/image.jpg","title":"nick freer comment thinking outside the box to attract digital talent","story":"        I wrote last week about one of this country\u0026#8217s top venture capitalists and his view that in order to succeed in all things tech, we need an increasing pool of local digital and IT talent together with more senior managers experienced in global growth.                This stacks up with ScotlandIS’s annual survey which found that the local marketplace is anticipated to provide the bulk of new people talent, with 70 per cent of respondent companies expecting to recruit from within Scotland in 2018. No huge surprises here and a more interesting finding was around a marked increase in company demand for modern apprentices, with almost half of respondents saying they would recruit in this way.              Peter Proud, CEO and founder of Cortex Worldwide whose cloud-based technology platform includes Microsoft as a key client, says the group’s graduate apprenticeship scheme is “the second best thing we’ve done after founding the company.” Proud praises the work of ecosystem players like Skills Development Scotland (SDS) and Edinburgh Napier University to support further learning and employers, the overall engagement of the Scottish Government and says that the performance of Cortex’s graduate apprentices have “at least matched, in some cases exceeded” that of traditional university graduates. Cortex’s CEO, who will shortly take up a board position with ScotlandIS, also says his team is actively looking to hire from digital skills academy CodeClan over the next few weeks.              CodeClan deserves a special mention here, with around 600 people set to have graduated from its 16-week Professional Software Development Course by the end of the year. Key to CodeClan’s long-term success will be expanding the network of commercial and public sector employers who take on its graduates. George Elliott, Craneware’s chairman and a former Wolfson Microelectronics finance chief, reminded me last week not to forget about other skill sets: “It’s not just digital skills that we need but also commercial skills and knowledge of how to scale, market and sell the technology.” Elliott, whose track record of selling into the North American market during his time at Wolfson is nothing short of legendary, says we are better at this in Scotland than we were but we have to do more to compete effectively.   The CEO of one of Scotland’s most highly rated scale-ups, John Peebles of Administrate, says there is “a massive skills gap within the industry for people who are not engineers but have worked at large, scaling global tech start-ups. The skills shortage will become an acute choke point for the local tech industry within the next three years as local start-ups begin to mature.”Kelli Buchan, a highly rated technology recruitment specialist who has helped to build teams for fast-growth companies like Adminisrate, FanDuel, snap40 and pureLiFi, says: “Without a doubt Scotland, especially Edinburgh, has a thriving tech scene.“The opportunities in the digital sector are excellent and varied, for those who live here or those who move to work here. However, the biggest challenge in this sector is the fact that the competition between employers looking for talent is huge.            “There are simply not enough great candidates to fill the open roles which exist, especially in the start-up scene. From my experience with startups, recruitment is one of the last things they think about as they are so focused on building a product and securing funding.“When both are achieved, they then need to hire fast and the talent is so hard to find. The advice I always give to CEOs is to think and have your hiring plan in place at the very beginning so you do not lose out to competitors.”Susanne Mitschke, CEO and founder of MindMate, which develops apps to manage dementia from a headquarters in Glasgow with an investor base of US VCs, thinks Scotland has a very good standing when it comes to digital talent. Mitschke says: “We use the University of Glasgow’s recruitment system to find graduates and the quality has been fantastic. I see many other companies, in places like London, Berlin and the US who have trouble finding software developers, particularly affordable ones.”    In big news in Scotland’s informatics circles, David Richardson, currently director of partnerships at the University of Edinburgh’s soon to be opened Bayes Centre, is set to move to Heriot-Watt later this year to take up the position of chief entrepreneurial executive at the university’s new Discovery and Innovation Centre. Richardson says: “We have fantastic initiatives in Scotland focused on addressing the digital skills gap. Data science and cyber security are two of the hot areas right now and we need to continually work across industry, government and academia to help people upskill and retrain for the future.”             Overall, Richardson thinks Scotland’s report card reads well but says we could be doing more at primary and secondary level in order to start the “digital journey” even earlier.- Nick Freer is a founding director at the Freer Consultancy and Full Circle Partners"},{"url":null,"title":"dominic raab appointed new brexit secretary","story":"        Dominic Raab has been appointed Brexit Secretary following the resignation of David Davis, Downing Street has announced.

It could be the nets have snagged on the bottom. There could be a wreck and they\u0026#8217ve torn their net, and the net has come clear.\u0026#8221It\u0026#8217s not his fault if he\u0026#8217s lost a bit of his net.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another.

They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nMonday 9 Jul 2018 1:39

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
