Narendra Modi taking part in a yoga session to mark International Yoga Day in DehradunNarendra joined the BJP in 1987 and soon became the General Secretary of the Gujarat branch, influential in ensuring that the party’s presence was strong in the following years. Three years after joining, he participated in a coalition government and helped to achieve success in the 1995 state legislative assembly elections.Despite the BJP’s control over the Indian government being short-lived, only lasting a few months in 1996, Modi was made the secretary of the BJP’s national organisation in New Delhi and three years later, appointed the General Secretary.However, because of fellow BJP member and Gujarat Chief Minister Keshubhai Patel’s poor response to the Bhuj earthquake in 2000, that killed more than 20,000 people, Modi replaced him and went on to enter his first-ever electoral contest in February 2002, which he went on to win and take a seat in the state assembly.Modi’s political career was then marred with controversy and scandal: his role during the Gujarat riots in 2002 were questioned and he was accused of condoning violence, or at least, not doing enough to stop the killing of over 1,000 people, mostly Muslims.          Theresa May and Narendra Modi arrive for a photograph ahead of the India-U.K. Tech SummitIn 2005, the US declined to issue him a diplomatic visa on the grounds that he was responsible for these riots and the UK also criticised him for this. While Modi escaped without any indictment, his close associates were found guilty of complicity and were jailed.His government has also been accused of extrajudicial killings: one case resulting the deaths of a woman and three men, members of the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba, involved in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, were alleged to have been plotting to assassinate Modi.Modi was soon indispensable to the BJP and under his leadership, the party secured victory in 2002 after winning 127 of the 182 seats in the chamber and again in 2007 before prevailing again in 2012. Both times he won his contests and returned as Chief Minister.          Justin Trudeau, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, Francois Hollande and Narendra Modi poseModi speechIn Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech, he hailed India’s rise under his government and said that ‘policy paralysis’ during the UPA rule was over, according to The Times of India. From the Red Fort, Modi spent 88 minutes addressing his nation and explored burning issues.‘When 125 crore people move towards achieving a goal, there is nothing that cannot happen. In 2014, the people of the country did not just stop at forming the government. They moved together towards nation-building and are contributing to do so.’After showcasing his achievements, he stated that ‘India was earlier a sleeping elephant which has woken up now and started running’ and went on to quote Tamil nationalist icon Subramania Bharti to say in Tamil, ‘India will show the path to the world.‘I am restless, I am agitated and I am also impatient for my country to lead the fourth industrial revolution, the revolution that is based on knowledge, the revolution which will be led by those who have IT skills. I am impatient for my county to lead it.’          Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, former Deputy L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi picturedHe also announced the rollout of the Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Scheme, which has been described as the world’s largest healthcare measure and will cover 500 million people, providing a cover of 500,000 rupees (£5,600) per family a year.In addition to discussing the commissioning of women in the armed forces, he spoke about the recent incidents of rape, but made no mention of the hot topic being debated in this country at the moment of lynching.Modi also promised that he would send a manned flight into space by 2022 and become the fourth country to achieve this. India is currently the sixth-largest economy in the world and Modi said that international institutions will see the subcontinent as as engine to strengthen the world economy for the next three decades.He will seek another five-year term for his party at elections due by March-April next year.Narendra Modi net worthWhile Narendra Modi may be the leader of the sixth-largest economy in the world, he only keeps a measly Rs 4,700 (£55) as cash in hand.His total assets are worth Rs 14 million (£16,000) because of a property he owns in Gandhinagar, the value of which has increased by more than 25 times since it was purchased 13 years ago, according to Mashable.He does not own any vehicles, aircrafts, yachts or ships and while he has no loans, Modi owns four gold rings, which are worth Rs 1,19,000 (£1380). It was also revealed that he was one of the most modestly-paid world leaders and earned a salary of Rs 1.9 million (£24,000).Madonna music: Like A Virgin singer\u0027s best songs revealed on her 60th birthdayPornhub gives Indian users a week\u0026#8217s free membership on Independence DayFortnite update 1.72: Epic Games launch new PS4 and Android patch for v5.21 releaseAsian Games 2018: All you need to knowDele Alli celebration: How to do it and what does it mean?Guava Island: Are Rihanna and Childish Gambino starring in a film together?Who is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan?

They had insisted Stokes protected them from verbal abuse.Stokes, who had admitted drinking heavily but denied being \u0027really very drunk\u0027 had insisted in court: \u0027Everything I did that night, I did in defence of myself.\u0027He said he had acted to protect Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor from homophobic abuse.          Following his acquittal Stokes was immediately restored to the England squad for Saturday’s Test against IndiaNottinghamshire batsman Hales, 29, had been credited by the prosecution with attempting to calm the ruckus until footage of him \u0027stamping\u0027 on Mr Ali emerged in evidence. In police bodycam footage of Stokes\u0027 arrest, Hales appeared to lie to PC Stacey Alway, claiming he had missed the fight.Despite the severity of the violence he allegedly used, and his apparent lies to police, Hales was not arrested or charged, merely interviewed under caution.In his closing speech, Stokes\u0027 barrister Gordon Cole QC went as far as to suggest that Hales could have been responsible for Mr Ali\u0027s injuries, which included a fractured eye socket. The CPS said it was an Avon and Somerset Police decision not to pursue Hales.On the morning the trial began, prosecutors sought to lay two additional, more serious charges against Stokes to reflect the injuries suffered by Mr Hale and Mr Ali. But Judge Peter Blair QC said introducing the counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence carrying a sentence of up to five years in jail, would be unfair on Stokes and his legal team at such a late stage. The decision  is under scrutiny following the last-minute attempt to introduce the extra charges and the acquittal of Mr Hale halfway through the trial.Jurors may have been baffled by the absence of Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor, who maintain that Stokes defended them against homophobic abuse. Sources said the CPS deemed them unreliable.As the jury, who deliberated for two hours and 34 minutes, announced the not guilty verdicts, Stokes\u0027 chest heaved and he staggered forward, tears welling in his eyes, before he shook Mr Ali\u0027s hand. In the public gallery, Stokes\u0027 wife Clare wept and embraced his agent Neil Fairbrother.Outside court, Mr Stokes\u0027 solicitor Paul Lunt told reporters: \u0027Today\u0027s verdict represents the end of an 11-month ordeal for Ben during which time he has had to maintain his silence at times when many on social media, and certain parts of the Press, predetermined his guilt long before the trial began.\u0027The jury\u0027s decision ... fairly reflects the truth of what happened in Bristol that night.\u0027A CPS spokesman said: \u0027A decision to charge this case was made following detailed consideration of the evidence and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges for a jury to consider. We respect the jury\u0027s decision. The CPS keeps cases under continual review.\u0027We selected the charge of affray at the outset in accordance with the Code. Upon further review we considered that additional assault charges would be appropriate.\u0027Avon and Somerset Police said: \u0027Early investigative advice was sought from the CPS in relation to Alex Hales\u0027 involvement in the incident and a decision was subsequently made at a senior level to take no further action against him "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/16/13/4F22FD7D00000578-6067031-image-m-151_1534421451506.jpg","title":"Gordon Ramsay congratulates twins level success","story":"    Gordon Ramsay posted this picture and message about his twins Jack and Holly on InstagramRamsay, who also has a 16-year-old daughter called Tilly with his wife Tana, 43, said in the post today: \u0027Well done Jack and Holly! \u0027Two more Ramsays off to university.\u0027Exeter (and) Ravensbourne.

CIA Director John Brennan testifying before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearingJohn Brennan CIABrennan served with the Directorate of Intelligence (DI) before working for the State Department as a Political Officer at the US Embassy in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and went on to direct terrorism analysis at the Director of Central Intelligence’s Counterterrorism Center in the 1990s.According to Britannica, he then acted as the CIA’s daily intelligence briefer under former President Bill Clinton before serving as the agency’s chief of station in Saudi Arabia, as Chief of Staff to CIA Director George Tenet and the CIA’s Deputy Executive Director.Before retiring from the CIA in 2005, he led efforts for the formation of an organisation that would become the National Counterterrorism Centre and was an interim director. Brennan then took on a role as President and CEO of the Analysis Corporation and Chairman of the Board at the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, but this was short-lived.Following this, while former President Barack Obama found that he shared similar philosophies when it came to the CIA, Brennan’s involvement in enhanced interrogation techniques working under President George W. Bush, he was not appointed as head of the agency.          President Barack Obama and former Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, listen to John BrennanInstead, Brennan was made Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and Cyberattacks for around four years and in this role, helped to share US policy in response to a number of different events.He also oversaw the CIA’s use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, that were used to target terrorists in Pakistan and Yemen. However, this and his involvement in methods such as waterboarding during the Bush era were called into question with Obama nominated him to lead the CIA in 2013.Brennan said that he was against waterboarding and despite this, his appointment was approved by the Senate 63-34. As reported by Reuters, during his tenure, Brennan created ten new mission centres so that the CIA could focus on cyberthreats.In 2017, he also briefed Trump, along with James Comey, Mike Rogers and James Clapper, on the findings in regards to Russian election interference and the allegations contained in the Steele dossier, as reported by CBS News.Before he left office, Brennan was open about how he felt about the current US President and said: ‘I don\u0027t think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia\u0027s intentions and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world. Brennan stated that it was outrageous that Trump was equating the intelligence community with Nazi Germany”.’John Brennan is married to Kathy Pokluda Brennan, also of North Bergen and is the father of a son and twin daughters.John Brennan on TrumpJohn Brennan hit back at Trump after he ordered that his security clearance should be revoked and wrote that the President’s campaign had colluded with Moscow to win in the 2016 election. Trump said that this decision was made because of Brennan’s ‘erratic conduct’ and ‘outrageous allegations’, according to the BBC. Trump cited that the Department of Justice’s inquiry into Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election was the reason why Brennan’s clearance was revoked.However, in the NYT piece that Brennan wrote, he said that his clearance was a politically motivated ‘attempt to scare into silence’ other critics of the President. He continued: ‘Mr Trump’s claims of no collusion are, in a word, hogwash.’Madonna music: Like A Virgin singer\u0027s best songs revealed on her 60th birthdayPornhub gives Indian users a week\u0026#8217s free membership on Independence DayFortnite update 1.72: Epic Games launch new PS4 and Android patch for v5.21 releaseAsian Games 2018: All you need to knowDele Alli celebration: How to do it and what does it mean?Guava Island: Are Rihanna and Childish Gambino starring in a film together?Who is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan?

An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed Kamel had met with Netanyahu in Israel this week, but gave no details.Corbyn says he was \u0027standing up for democracy\u0027 by making...Share this articleA Palestinian source in Ramallah said Kamel has left without seeing Abbas, who had been preoccupied with a Palestinian leadership conference. But the source said Abbas had informed Egypt that Fatah representatives would join the Cairo talks later this week or next week.Apart from the opening of its Kerem Shalom commercial crossing into Gaza, Israel also expanded the enclave\u0027s fishing zone, in waters under Israeli naval blockade, from three to nine nautical miles off the southern coast and to six nautical miles in the north, according to the head of Gaza\u0027s fishermen\u0027s union.The Egyptian security source said the extended truce would also include opening a sea lane from Gaza to Cyprus under Israeli supervision.A Palestinian official in Gaza familiar with the talks said Palestinian factions were demanding a \u0027total lifting of the blockade on Gaza, opening all crossings with Israel and Egypt and a water corridor\u0027.Israel says its blockade is a self-defence measure against Hamas, a group that has called for its destruction.Israel\u0027s security cabinet, a forum of senior ministers headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the Gaza situation on Wednesday and an Israeli \u0027diplomatic official\u0027 said Hamas would have to prove its commitment to the truce.          Hamas representaive in Lebanon Oussama Hamdan (R) listens to Abbas Zaki, representative of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO)in LebanonAs well as wanting calm along the border, Israel has said Hamas must return the remains of two soldiers killed in the 2014 Gaza war and release two civilians whose fate is unknown. It says they are being held by Hamas in Gaza.\u0027That\u0027s the only way,\u0027 Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Tzachi Hanegbi, a member of Netanyahu´s security cabinet, said on Thursday when asked if a broad arrangement depended on the return of the soldiers\u0027 bodies.\u0027Nothing will be done to enable (Gaza\u0027s) significant rehabilitation and the improvement of infrastructure and ports and other such fantasies, unless they release the bodies and the two Israeli captives,\u0027 he told Israel radio.The Egyptian security source said the long-term truce would also envisage Israel freeing hundreds of detained Palestinians in a prisoner swap.However, the Palestinian official denied any talks were taking place on a swap, saying Hamas opposed mixing the issues.Egypt has brokered a Palestinian reconciliation agreement that provides for Hamas to cede control of Gaza to Abbas\u0027s Palestinian Authority. A dispute over power-sharing has hindered implementation of the deal, but the Egyptian source said Cairo was still seeking progress on the issue.

Around 2.9million in the UK are currently using the devices, with around 470,000 using them to stop smoking.Last month, anti-tobacco campaigners called on the Government to act to prevent a new kind of e-cigarette from taking off among children, as it has done already in America. The Juul vape pens offer flavours such as mango and glacier mint.In March this year, NICE said the long-term health impact of e-cigarettes ‘was still developing’ and there was ‘little evidence’ of their effectiveness or safety as medicinal products. A series of reports have highlighted how e-cigarettes still have many negative health effects. These include increasing the risk of the lung condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung damage and infection. Nicotine – which is contained in e-cigarettes – is itself an addictive substance that increases heart rate and blood pressure.The World Health Organisation is among bodies to call for stiff regulation of e-cigarettes and bans on their indoor use.However, Public Health England claimed recently that e-cigarettes are ‘95 per cent safer’ than conventional smoking.That claim is repeated in today’s report which said: ‘Regulations should be relaxed relating to e-cigarettes licensing, prescribing and advertising of their health benefits.’Chairman Norman Lamb added: ‘If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS stop-smoking arsenal.’The committee said that while ‘uncertainties’ remained about the long-term health impact of the devices, they presented ‘an opportunity to significantly accelerate already declining smoking rates’.          Scientists are warning that e-cigarette vapour as well as tobacco can cause lung damageThe MPs also called for ‘wider debate’ on vaping in public spaces. While vaping is not illegal inside pubs or restaurants, many major pub and restaurant chains such as Wetherspoons have imposed bans indoors as it is difficult from a distance to tell whether someone is smoking or vaping.The MPs urged that a tobacco product called ‘snus’ – which is taken in the mouth – is made legal in the UK, despite the fact it has previously been linked to oral cancer.Cancer Research UK said any changes to current e-cigarette regulations should be aimed at helping smokers to quit while preventing young people from starting to use e-cigarettes.The science and technology committee said it has considered evidence from more than 90 organisations including a range of academics, NHS professionals, NICE, and Government departments to inform its recommendations. John Dunne, for the UK Vaping Industry Association said the report was a ‘ringing endorsement of vaping’s public health potential’.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/01/4F25F87700000578-6069301-Presenter_and_Strictly_Come_Dancing_star_Katie_Derham_right_said-a-3_1534465120470.jpg","title":"Proportion grades highest level six years","story":"    Entries graded A and A* hit its highest in six  years yesterday Hundreds of thousands of pupils travelled to their schools to pick up their results having been the first to sit new exams in most of the mainstream subjects.The qualifications had been designed to better prepare youngsters for university, and much of the coursework – in which it is easier to gain marks – has been abolished. But it emerged that grade boundaries have been set low in many of the new exams to stop a fall in results – leading critics to accuse regulators of \u0027undermining\u0027 the changes.One geography paper set its C pass mark at 49 per cent, in comparison with 61 per cent in previous years, while the boundary for an A was 68 per cent, compared with 77 before. Meanwhile, a physics paper set the boundary for a C at 39 per cent, compared with 60 per cent in previous years, and set the A boundary at 58 per cent, compared with 80 per cent before. It also emerged that:Boys continue to outperform girls at the highest A-level grades, with 8.5 per cent of male students achieving A*s, compared with 7.6 per cent of female entriesOnly 1.8 per cent of English language papers were graded A*, leading experts to warn it could indicate widespread literacy problems caused by their reliance on text-speakRussell Group universities were lowering their entry requirements in clearing in a scramble to fill placesA record number of overseas students were accepted onto UK degree courses despite Brexit doom predictions.The new A-levels were pioneered by the then education secretary Michael Gove as part of a drive to toughen up qualifications.Universities had complained that students were not being prepared properly for how they will need to work during a degree.Officials say the new content is not more difficult in itself, but the structure of the courses is more challenging because they are assessed via exams at the end of sixth form. Previously, courses were assessed in stages and through coursework, which students tended to find easier to deal with.The new qualifications caused widespread panic in the education world. Teachers had warned that their pupils could lose out because schools were unfamiliar with the new course content. But on results day yesterday, data showed 26.4 per cent of UK entries were given one of the two top grades – up 0.1 percentage points on last year.The last time the proportion was this high was in 2012, when 26.6 per cent got these grades.However, there was also a decrease of 0.3 percentage points in the proportion – 8 per cent – getting A*. This is the lowest it has been since 2013. And the proportion of A* to C grades also fell by 0.4 percentage points to 77 per cent.A Daily Mail audit of grade boundaries found many had been set lower than in 2016 – the last year that all of the old qualifications were sat before the new ones began to be introduced.Ofqual, the exams regulator, has instructed boards to make sure similar proportions of students get good grades as in previous years, even if overall performance drops.           Officials say the new content is not more difficult but the structure is much more challengingThe measures have been taken to stop students from being \u0027disadvantaged\u0027 by the new system, in comparison with their older peers.But Alan Smithers, a professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said: \u0027What\u0027s the point of tougher A-levels if Ofqual is going to undermine them by keeping the grades the same? Ofqual\u0027s intervention is not allowing the marks to speak for themselves. One wonders what the point of the upheaval has been.\u0027Ofqual said its strategy for setting grade boundaries would remain in place at least for the next year or so while the qualifications bed in.A spokesman said: \u0027Grade boundaries have been set using statistics to carry forward standards from previous qualifications.\u0027Examiners have confirmed that the standard of work in each subject is appropriate for the grade.\u0027A Department for Education spokesman said: The high standards we expect in these exams have remained the same.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/01/14B4C79800000514-0-image-a-11_1534465652488.jpg","title":"High streets brink job losses shop closures forecast","story":"    The crisis hitting the High Street was laid bare yesterday showing nearly £1 in every £5 is spent onlineThe crisis has been highlighted by the Mail’s Save Our High Streets campaign.Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at savings and investments firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the high street was facing a double whammy from web shopping.‘Even if more traditional stores are switching to the online channel, that means they need less physical space to sell stuff from,’ he said.‘That spells more store closures, which clearly does nothing to attract people to the high street and is likely to contribute to declining footfall.’Figures from the ONS reveal that online spending shows no sign of slowing down.

He is also under pressure to freeze business rates amid warnings that the high street faces another crippling tax hike next year.If the consumer prices index rate of inflation stays at its current rate of 2.5 per cent next month, the retail sector in England will see their rates bill jump by £194million next year, according to industry experts Altus Group.

The increase was driven by 23 legal unions taken out by women.The number of male partnerships was five fewer in 2017 than 2016.In 2013, the last year before marriage was opened to same-sex couples, 5,646 civil partnerships were celebrated.Last year, most partnerships were taken out by older men. Two-thirds of the total were between male partners and more than half of new partners were over 50.Some 85 per cent of new civil partners were people who had never been married or in a civil union.In 2017, partnerships between women were more likely to end than those between men, with 689 female and 528 male unions dissolved. Most break-ups were among partners under 50.The dissolution rates contrast with those for marriage.

They had insisted Stokes protected them from verbal abuse.Stokes, who had admitted drinking heavily but denied being \u0027really very drunk\u0027 had insisted in court: \u0027Everything I did that night, I did in defence of myself.\u0027He said he had acted to protect Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor from homophobic abuse.          Following his acquittal Stokes was immediately restored to the England squad for Saturday’s Test against IndiaNottinghamshire batsman Hales, 29, had been credited by the prosecution with attempting to calm the ruckus until footage of him \u0027stamping\u0027 on Mr Ali emerged in evidence. In police bodycam footage of Stokes\u0027 arrest, Hales appeared to lie to PC Stacey Alway, claiming he had missed the fight.Despite the severity of the violence he allegedly used, and his apparent lies to police, Hales was not arrested or charged, merely interviewed under caution.In his closing speech, Stokes\u0027 barrister Gordon Cole QC went as far as to suggest that Hales could have been responsible for Mr Ali\u0027s injuries, which included a fractured eye socket. The CPS said it was an Avon and Somerset Police decision not to pursue Hales.On the morning the trial began, prosecutors sought to lay two additional, more serious charges against Stokes to reflect the injuries suffered by Mr Hale and Mr Ali. But Judge Peter Blair QC said introducing the counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence carrying a sentence of up to five years in jail, would be unfair on Stokes and his legal team at such a late stage. The decision  is under scrutiny following the last-minute attempt to introduce the extra charges and the acquittal of Mr Hale halfway through the trial.Jurors may have been baffled by the absence of Mr Barry and Mr O\u0027Connor, who maintain that Stokes defended them against homophobic abuse. Sources said the CPS deemed them unreliable.As the jury, who deliberated for two hours and 34 minutes, announced the not guilty verdicts, Stokes\u0027 chest heaved and he staggered forward, tears welling in his eyes, before he shook Mr Ali\u0027s hand. In the public gallery, Stokes\u0027 wife Clare wept and embraced his agent Neil Fairbrother.Outside court, Mr Stokes\u0027 solicitor Paul Lunt told reporters: \u0027Today\u0027s verdict represents the end of an 11-month ordeal for Ben during which time he has had to maintain his silence at times when many on social media, and certain parts of the Press, predetermined his guilt long before the trial began.\u0027The jury\u0027s decision ... fairly reflects the truth of what happened in Bristol that night.\u0027A CPS spokesman said: \u0027A decision to charge this case was made following detailed consideration of the evidence and in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges for a jury to consider. We respect the jury\u0027s decision. The CPS keeps cases under continual review.\u0027We selected the charge of affray at the outset in accordance with the Code. Upon further review we considered that additional assault charges would be appropriate.\u0027Avon and Somerset Police said: \u0027Early investigative advice was sought from the CPS in relation to Alex Hales\u0027 involvement in the incident and a decision was subsequently made at a senior level to take no further action against him "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/16/17/4F21906200000578-6067835-The_convertible_is_just_one_of_92_to_be_built_in_it_s_earliest_s-m-40_1534438764830.jpg","title":"Stunning limited edition E type Jaguar convertible built 1961 goes auction 380 000","story":"    One of the earliest surviving E-type Jaguars dating back to 1961 is coming up to auction this October for £380,000The blue beauty, which is number 64 of the 92, is to sell with H\u0026ampH Classics, who have described it as \u0027the E-Type in its purest form\u0027. Of the 92 originally built, 18 models were given to VIPs including officials high up in Jaguar and enthusiasts who could race them. Another 56 were sent to various specialist dealers, including the roadster which has now emerged for sale once again.It is not known how many of those survive today, but it is thought to be significantly fewer than left the factory.

Around 2.9million in the UK are currently using the devices, with around 470,000 using them to stop smoking.Last month, anti-tobacco campaigners called on the Government to act to prevent a new kind of e-cigarette from taking off among children, as it has done already in America. The Juul vape pens offer flavours such as mango and glacier mint.In March this year, NICE said the long-term health impact of e-cigarettes ‘was still developing’ and there was ‘little evidence’ of their effectiveness or safety as medicinal products. A series of reports have highlighted how e-cigarettes still have many negative health effects. These include increasing the risk of the lung condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung damage and infection. Nicotine – which is contained in e-cigarettes – is itself an addictive substance that increases heart rate and blood pressure.The World Health Organisation is among bodies to call for stiff regulation of e-cigarettes and bans on their indoor use.However, Public Health England claimed recently that e-cigarettes are ‘95 per cent safer’ than conventional smoking.That claim is repeated in today’s report which said: ‘Regulations should be relaxed relating to e-cigarettes licensing, prescribing and advertising of their health benefits.’Chairman Norman Lamb added: ‘If used correctly, e-cigarettes could be a key weapon in the NHS stop-smoking arsenal.’The committee said that while ‘uncertainties’ remained about the long-term health impact of the devices, they presented ‘an opportunity to significantly accelerate already declining smoking rates’.          Scientists are warning that e-cigarette vapour as well as tobacco can cause lung damageThe MPs also called for ‘wider debate’ on vaping in public spaces. While vaping is not illegal inside pubs or restaurants, many major pub and restaurant chains such as Wetherspoons have imposed bans indoors as it is difficult from a distance to tell whether someone is smoking or vaping.The MPs urged that a tobacco product called ‘snus’ – which is taken in the mouth – is made legal in the UK, despite the fact it has previously been linked to oral cancer.Cancer Research UK said any changes to current e-cigarette regulations should be aimed at helping smokers to quit while preventing young people from starting to use e-cigarettes.The science and technology committee said it has considered evidence from more than 90 organisations including a range of academics, NHS professionals, NICE, and Government departments to inform its recommendations. John Dunne, for the UK Vaping Industry Association said the report was a ‘ringing endorsement of vaping’s public health potential’.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/17/01/027A0FE50000044D-6069323-image-a-4_1534464517932.jpg","title":"Proportion grades highest level six years","story":"    Entries graded A and A* hit its highest in six  years yesterday Hundreds of thousands of pupils travelled to their schools to pick up their results having been the first to sit new exams in most of the mainstream subjects.The qualifications had been designed to better prepare youngsters for university, and much of the coursework – in which it is easier to gain marks – has been abolished. But it emerged that grade boundaries have been set low in many of the new exams to stop a fall in results – leading critics to accuse regulators of \u0027undermining\u0027 the changes.One geography paper set its C pass mark at 49 per cent, in comparison with 61 per cent in previous years, while the boundary for an A was 68 per cent, compared with 77 before. Meanwhile, a physics paper set the boundary for a C at 39 per cent, compared with 60 per cent in previous years, and set the A boundary at 58 per cent, compared with 80 per cent before. It also emerged that:Boys continue to outperform girls at the highest A-level grades, with 8.5 per cent of male students achieving A*s, compared with 7.6 per cent of female entriesOnly 1.8 per cent of English language papers were graded A*, leading experts to warn it could indicate widespread literacy problems caused by their reliance on text-speakRussell Group universities were lowering their entry requirements in clearing in a scramble to fill placesA record number of overseas students were accepted onto UK degree courses despite Brexit doom predictions.The new A-levels were pioneered by the then education secretary Michael Gove as part of a drive to toughen up qualifications.Universities had complained that students were not being prepared properly for how they will need to work during a degree.Officials say the new content is not more difficult in itself, but the structure of the courses is more challenging because they are assessed via exams at the end of sixth form. Previously, courses were assessed in stages and through coursework, which students tended to find easier to deal with.The new qualifications caused widespread panic in the education world. Teachers had warned that their pupils could lose out because schools were unfamiliar with the new course content. But on results day yesterday, data showed 26.4 per cent of UK entries were given one of the two top grades – up 0.1 percentage points on last year.The last time the proportion was this high was in 2012, when 26.6 per cent got these grades.However, there was also a decrease of 0.3 percentage points in the proportion – 8 per cent – getting A*. This is the lowest it has been since 2013. And the proportion of A* to C grades also fell by 0.4 percentage points to 77 per cent.A Daily Mail audit of grade boundaries found many had been set lower than in 2016 – the last year that all of the old qualifications were sat before the new ones began to be introduced.Ofqual, the exams regulator, has instructed boards to make sure similar proportions of students get good grades as in previous years, even if overall performance drops.           Officials say the new content is not more difficult but the structure is much more challengingThe measures have been taken to stop students from being \u0027disadvantaged\u0027 by the new system, in comparison with their older peers.But Alan Smithers, a professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said: \u0027What\u0027s the point of tougher A-levels if Ofqual is going to undermine them by keeping the grades the same? Ofqual\u0027s intervention is not allowing the marks to speak for themselves.

In the 1990s, I started thinking about how children were engaging with gaming and the internet, which were still embryonic. So when I moved back to Edinburgh from London, I set about exploring how digital learning was being used in schools.The more time I spent in schools, the more I saw what children were actually doing. One of those things was museum visits – and it was clear that digital culture was greatly affecting museums too. So I spent a year trailing school parties taking guided tours around the Royal Museums of Scotland. I would secrete myself in a corner with my lights – this was in the days before cordless equipment – and shoot large groups quickly, then in post-production isolate single children. Here, you can see a split reflection of two girls in the vitrine, but only one of them actually looking.The memories you have of going to a museum are not of your classmates, they are of the objects. I remember the children speaking to the guards, often asking them: “Is it alive or is it dead?” They were five or six years old. The guard would hesitate, saying: “Well, it was alive and now it’s dead.” I can relate to that sense of anxiety. Even now at the zoo, if I’m standing too close to the lion enclosure, I feel nervous. It just appears too open, even though you know the animals cannot get out.The vitrines became a really important part of all the images. This one was an amazing display case in a Victorian gallery, with a glass cupola that gave beautiful overhead light. I remember visiting it myself as a child. On the other side of the bears, there was a Bengal tiger. We would line up to sit down on our little padded seats, inches away from this huge creature. Being in such close proximity to something like that was a strange, memorable experience. And that inidual experience is what I wanted to capture: a child engaging with something much larger than itself.These Victorian displays and dioramas were often quite ferocious and bloody, with animals ripping out each other’s gizzards. That kind of containment of emotion or feeling is a gift for a photographer.The children loved the bears and the birds most. There’s another image of an owl swooping on a taxidermied mouse with a little boy looking out to the camera in front of the case. And another of an impossibly huge albatross in a beautiful sculpted case. The images that worked best were those that played with scale: a very small child engaging with a very large object.I was thinking about children’s engagement with the outside world, especially in the face of the rapidly evolving culture of gaming and the screen. When I was that age, the museum was the place where everything important was held. Now with the internet, that is very different. If a child wants to learn about something, they don’t naturally go to the museum. They go online.This gallery no longer exists. Some of the objects have been brought out, cleaned up and displayed elsewhere, freed from the glass cases. Going back 20 years on, it’s like seeing old friends.Wendy McMurdo is in the group show In Focus: Scottish Photography at City Art Centre – which is part of this year’s Edinburgh Art Festival – until 26 AugustBorn: Edinburgh, 1962.Training: Edinburgh College of Art, Pratt Institute, Goldsmiths, University of London.Influences: “Lee Miller, Man Ray, Susan Hiller, Marina Warner, Sarah Charlesworth, Valérie Belin, Martin Scorsese, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.” High point: “Having my first British Council touring show and beginning to see the work go out into the world.

Access to both warehouses continued to be closed on Thursday as the dispute remained unresolved.A source close to Sports Direct said it had been forced to cancel orders as XPO was being “totally unreasonable in terms of their demands” and was “refusing to engage in any process” which would “move the situation forward”.“XPO is trying to hold us to ransom,” the source said.It is understood that XPO has blocked suppliers and Sports Direct from entering the warehouses. XPO was not available for comment.Some fashion suppliers have taken action while negotiations over payments continue. Jigsaw has removed stock from 20 stores, and brands including Karen Millen and Mint Velvet are also understood to have withdrawn some stock. These brands run concessions in House of Fraser store and so own unsold items. Ownership of that stock was not passed to administrators or included in Sports Direct’s purchase.One concession operator said it was continuing to operate as it hoped a deal could be agreed. “We have been getting paid since Friday and are meeting people from House of Fraser next week,” the operator said.Sports Direct has no legal obligation to pay suppliers money owed before its buyout as their debts were part of the administration. No supplier debts are expected to be paid from the administrators as virtually all the proceeds from Sports Direct’s buyout are going to its banks and bondholders. However, new owners often agree to settle at least some of the debts in the interest of good relations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdf44bf802da4c34054c780a86f016923ee1c54c/0_146_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c27964d1f038d49e16aa7515c3f327d9","title":"this summer doesnt belong in scandinavia your stories of heat around the world","story":"From Hawaii to the Netherlands and France to South Korea readers have shared their reactions to recent record temperaturesIn mid-July last year, Haythem Ayari, a 23-year-old engineering student in Nabeul, coastal Tunisia, caught a bus to travel the 10km to university. The vehicle, already overloaded with passengers, was caught in gridlocked traffic and sat static for nearly an hour. There was a heatwave, with a temperature of about 38C (100F) outside inside the bus it was 42C (108F). “At a specific moment, I just snapped,” remembered Ayari. “I got out in the middle of traffic to finally breathe.” Since then, he has been inclined to panic attacks if in confined, crowded spaces during hot weather.A month earlier, approximately 2,000 km (1300 miles) away in Bristol, UK, Adam Corner was on a bus with his partner and their new baby, heading across the city to visit friends. The bus was held up in traffic – not for long, but long enough. “It became a kind of inferno,” said Dr Corner, research director at Climate Outreach their baby, barely a month old, started screaming in a way Corner had never heard before. “We had a little insight into this immediate, visceral risk – you see it through the eyes of your newborn child.” He pulled the bus’s emergency cord and they jumped off into traffic.This tale of two bus journeys tells a story of rising temperatures and the pressure they are putting on cities and the people who live in them. Asked by  Cities to share their experiences for a week-long series on urban heat, readers from countries as disparate as Hawaii, the Netherlands, Australia, Denmark, Japan, France, Malaysia, Romania, South Korea and Canada expressed concern about the impacts already being felt.“When I moved here many years ago, we used to joke: ‘This summer happened on a Wednesday in Paris’,” wrote Mariann Gyorke. “That’s not the case anymore.” In an effort to preserve the cooler temperatures inside her family’s top-floor apartment, she had been cooking only cold dishes and shielding the windows with makeshift shutters made of cardboard.Around the world, people altered their behaviour and adapted their schedules to cope with the heatwave. In order to sleep, Michele Howie of Sydney soaked her nightwear in water and lay on a towel in front of two fans. Anna Mastersson in Mariehamn, of Finland’s Åland Islands, said her relative had been forced to buy a new car with air conditioning and a roof window: “In this weather and having to drive two small kids, she had no choice.” In her neighbourhood, dogs were being taken out later at night, for shorter walks. In Montreal, Frederic Hore had noticed people lingering in pedestrian passageways of the metro station to catch the pulse of cool air created by passing trains.Outside, green spaces dried up, with follow-on effects for agriculture and often the economy. Inge Kersten wrote of Nijmegen, this year’s European Green Capital, “Leaves are falling in our lovely green city”. On her family’s organic farm near Aarhus, Denmark, Jessica Tamminga had watched fields turn from green to brown: “The trees are turning yellow like it’s fall”. But for the impact on her business, she said, the heat was “rather pleasant – except for the disconcerting feeling that this California summer doesn’t belong in Scandinavia.”Britons, in particular, seemed more ready to take the warmer temperatures at face value. “We’re all enjoying a real summer at last,” wrote Regan Armitage. “Everyone seems uncharacteristically happy in Leeds.” Frank Holt in Brighton described the summer as “luxuriating, joyful, a little alcoholic, a summer you don’t need to go away for”. “It’s wonderful not moaning about the weather,” he wrote, adding that the ’s call-out had seem “designed to gain negative replies”.Holt expanded to  Cities by phone that, though he was concerned by climbing temperatures, he felt the onus was on scientists and the media to persuade politicians to act, he said in the meantime, the warmer weather “did have some enjoyable aspects”. “I think things sometimes should be enjoyed for what they are. This summer has been very good for Brighton.”And not all life was suffering in the heat. Jellyfish numbers had increased in the tropical seas around Jeju Island, wrote In-Gyum Kim from Seogwipo, its second-largest city. Helena in Columbia, South Carolina, said that judgin gby how often she was bitten, ticks and mosquitoes seemed to be thriving, as were “our famous Palmetto bugs” – cockroaches. In Kuala Lumpur, a bumper crop of the prized durian fruit saw prices come down to RM5 (£1) per kilo – but that had its own, unusual effect.The fruit is understood to raise the body’s temperature, said Vanessa Ting, a student in the Malaysian capital. “I ate three pieces and spent the rest of the day sweaty and uncomfortable, despite taking six showers.” At the pharmacy where she works part time, more customers had been reporting fevers, sore throats and coughs, attributed variously to the weather and durian. And she’d observed more retirees opting to meet at the McDonald’s where she regularly studied, rather than in more traditional coffee shops without air conditioning.  Cody Winchester had noticed more air conditioners being installed on more buildings in Honolulu. “People used to just open their windows and the fresh tropical breeze would pass through and cool the home. Now it’s unbearable to live in town without AC.” But many could not afford it, he added, as Hawaii has the most expensive electricity in the entire US.Many found their homes simply not built to cope with extreme temperatures. Adina wrote of Timisoara, Romania, that given its reliance on concrete and tarmac “the city becomes a frying pan in the heat”. Clive Warner, in Monterrey in northern Mexico, was opting to move 25km south to Santiago, Nuevo Leon, a greener area that is, on average, 5C cooler. “Having cardiac problems, I can’t tolerate it any longer,” he said of the 34-37C (93-99F) maximum shade temperature in Monterrey. “If it gets much hotter I don’t see how the place will be survivable in summer.”The electricity already sometimes fails in 39C (102F) heat, he added. “If that happens, I get in the car and drive to a shopping mall.”Air conditioning brought relief, but to a point that seemed drastically, even dangerously, at odds with ecology, said Tim Kelly in Naha, Japan. “Stores leave their front doors wide open, people enter and exit rooms without closing the door behind them – all the while blasting their air conditioning.” People even napped in their parked cars with the engines running.Not only was this dependance on air conditioning damaging to the environment, but moving regularly between radically different climes causes temperature shock, said Kelly. “Their bodies lose the ability to cope with the natural environment.” Johanna MacGregor said summer colds were common in Tokyo because shops, restaurants and the subway were often too cool, “while places like schools or community halls often have no aircon whatsoever – it’s one or the other.”It was in stark contrast to the picture painted by Patrycja Lickiewicz of Castalla in Alicante, Spain, as a society “in tacit compliance with nature”. There it is the norm to restrict activities to before 8.30am and after 8pm and to drink water, dress appropriately, and stick to the shade at all other hours. “No matter the temperatures people always behave the same way,” said Lickiewicz. “We do not complain, we just follow the same simple routines. When common sense prevails we keep ourselves and the environment in check.”But adapting is not simply a case of being sun-smart, Lickiewicz conceded, when at least the oldest buildings in Castalla are built of stone, with internal air flow directed through courtyards and shutters – which manages heat without the need for air conditioning.If cities are to cope with more extreme heat more frequently, there needs to be structural change across the board: building codes to ensure future housing stock is not only warm, but cool infrastructure that can cope and regulation to enforce safe behaviours. Harry May, in Fukuoka, Japan, wanted to see work shut down when the mercury climbs past 34C (“Think on that, the UK”) Monica Garcia-Galvan was in favour of introducing a water tax in Montreal to encourage people not to let taps run for minutes at a time (“if English people saw how Canadians wash dishes, they would faint”). Adina, in Timisoara, Romania, said authorities needed to enforce health and safety laws relating to working in unsafe temperatures: “We have them but no one respects them.” Alice Browning of Friedrichshafen, southern Germany, spoke for many with her desperate plea for more trees: “We really don’t want to be cooped up inside all day.”In many cities steps have already been taken. In Nantes, Patrick Brown said, boulevards cleared for cars were being redesigned to include plenty of green space, and art installations with water features had given people places in which to cool off in summer. The De Bastei centre operated a scheme in Nijmegen and elsewhere in the Netherlands where residents could swap tiles or stones from their garden for plants.Others saw opportunities to be grasped by tackling the rising temperatures. David Fraire said nothing could be done to ease the issue of heat in Chandler, Arizona. “This is Phoenix, valley of the sun – it comes with the territory.” But it could be better harnessed: “We should be using this heat to our advantage and convert all our power to solar source.” Frank Holt suggested that Britain could build its new, post-Brexit identity through investment in renewables.But even in amongst optimism there was a feeling of powerlessness, even fatalism. Washington DC residents would cope with the heat as they had done for decades, said Cara – but related issues, for example surrounding health problems and food insecurity, were a bigger unknown. “We’re already putting in more green, solar, or light-coloured roofs. We’re committed to keeping and increasing the tree canopy, too, to help lower temperatures.”But without greater commitment to addressing the root causes from regional authorities – for example, by shutting down the coal-fired power plants along the Potomac – Cara continued: “there is very little we can do”. Charlie in Redding, California, urged that the US “stop with the knuckle dragging” and return to the Paris climate accord and “thinking people” at once – if it was not already too late. The day he wrote, it was nearly 43C (109F): “Think that life as we have known it forever is on a collision course with a destiny that’s not beneficial for mankind!”Dr Adam Corner of Climate Outreach said adapting to climate change meant seeing its influence in every facet of life – not just the environment, and not just in high-profile periods of extreme weather. “It’s a really complex set of questions, but those tangible things are more relatable to people than ‘global temperatures are going to change by 2C’,” he said. “There are so many ways that climate change is with us now. It’s very much not a problem for the next generation – we need to be thinking about how we get to grips with it.”The effects and implications of rising temperatures need to be considered by doctors, urban planners, architects those working in business, transport, agriculture and food security. Yet even news stories about climate change were illustrated with photographs of polar bears and melting ice caps, or renderings of future cities. “It’s the human story of our generation, but you wouldn’t know it, from the way we visualise and present it. Where are the people in this?”In Nabeul, said Ayari, they were mostly indoors, sheltering in the air conditioning. Traffic had become unbearable and it was too hot even to go to the beach. His twin sister has a respiratory condition exacerbated by the heat and had been advised to stay indoors: “The doctors say it’s like an allergy to the weather,” said Ayari. “People are actually getting scared of going out and being confronted by the sun. You have empty streets in the daytime and huge crowds at night.“This heatwave we are witnessing is making me more and more concerned about our future in the city ... We have to talk more about the seriousness of this issue.” Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/085f5536e7b77683a73e44a71637afcb9ddfc1da/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deeec330f9b81d247e5ddbbda7b469c2","title":"jeremy corbyn critics speech labour leader","story":"Labour’s leader should own his mistakes – but he has been on the right side of history more often than many of his criticsOn 18 March 2008, during a media feeding frenzy about statements made by his radical Chicago pastor, Jeremiah Wright, presidential hopeful Barack Obama gave a speech in Philadelphia. His aim was to lay out his candidacy and experiences within the context of America’s racial history. Jeremy Corbyn needs to make a similar intervention over accusations of antisemitism. This is the speech he should, and could, give.For as long as I can remember, anti-racism and internationalism have been a central part of my life. My parents met at a rally supporting Spanish Republicans who were fighting General Franco’s fascists – a crucial episode in the spread of fascism across Europe that saw Hitler’s rise and all the carnage that came with it. My politics were shaped by a leftwing tradition that had a clear notion that injustice could not be tolerated – and that principle was as crucial to defend abroad as it was at home.So to be branded an antisemite – and the leader of an antisemitic party – after five decades of political activism is something I have had to take seriously, even as I have found it deeply distressing personally.Antisemitism has a long, vile and violent history, not least in this country and this continent, where Jews were all too recently threatened with being extinguished as a people. Accusations of antisemitism should never be dismissed summarily, cavalierly or defensively – it is far too serious a matter for that. Such accusations should not be made opportunistically, baselessly or for crude political gain, either – it is far too serious a matter for that, too. Antisemitism is an evil in itself. Its gravity does not hinge on whether the accuser or the accused is Labour or Tory, Jew or gentile, Old Labour or New.The left has an impressive history of fighting bigotry and racism in all its forms, and I am proud to have dedicated a significant section of my life to that struggle. I make no apology for that. It has been a struggle conducted both in parliament, where I was one of a handful of MPs who opposed the hostile environment policy that led to the ill-treatment of the Windrush generation, and in the streets, demonstrating with the Anti-Nazi League against the far right and neo-Nazis during the 1970s and beyond.The left has a proud record of internationalism and I am proud to have dedicated a significant part of my political life to that also. I protested against Saddam Hussein’s gassing of the Kurds in 1988 while the Tory government endorsed selling him weapons I marched against the illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003 when the Labour government joined the US. I was arrested for protesting against apartheid in 1984 when the British government still branded Nelson Mandela a terrorist. I supported dialogue between Sinn Féin and the British state, a strategy that led to peace, while our government sought military victory, which escalated the conflict.I make no apology for this either, even when there have been overtures I have made to groups or iniduals that, when orced from their historical context, appear unwise. Politics is about hard choices. You don’t make peace with your friends but with your enemies. I have been on the right side of history far more often than I have not been – and certainly far more often than those who seek to sully my name by distorting my past.There is no contradiction in being a committed anti-racist and an internationalist – indeed they come from exactly the same belief: that everybody should be treated equally, that our human rights are inisible and that discriminating against people is wrong, whoever you are and wherever you are. But there is a specific challenge when it comes to Israel and Palestine as it relates to antisemitism and British Jewry.There is no shortage of people, on every side of the Middle East conflict, who have blood on their hands. But it is my sincere belief that it is not a conflict between equals. Israel is a regional superpower backed by the west and armed to the teeth that occupies the West Bank and is building settlements on Palestinian land, in defiance of international law. It recently passed a law that makes Israeli-Arabs second-class citizens. Like most people in Britain and around the world we support the Palestinian right to create their own state.British Jews are not homogeneous. They have a range of views on everything, including the Middle East. That said – and for understandable reasons, particularly relating to the Holocaust – even though many British Jews are critical of Israeli policies, the vast majority feel a close affinity with the country.So my history of pro-Palestinian activism, which I have always been very open about, is a source of legitimate tension with many British Jews. Reasonable people can disagree on both the origins and the potential solutions to the conflict in the Middle East – that disagreement does not make either me or the Labour party antisemitic.The challenge has come in navigating that tension with sensitivity while establishing a clear, coherent and robust distinction between criticising Israel and criticising Jews. Over the last few years it has become painfully clear to me that some on the left have not always risen to that challenge.The left in general, and Labour in particular, does not have the antisemitism problem that many in the media and the political class accuse us of having. There is no poll or survey that supports the notion that antisemitism is rife on the left or, indeed, any worse than it is among Conservatives.Yet we do have a problem. Antisemitism is a hardy virus and it would be a grave mistake to assume that we are somehow immune from it. There are some on the left who seek to hold Jews accountable for what Israel does. That is wrong. Some believe that because Jews are overwhelmingly white and some are wealthy, antisemitism is somehow less worthy of our concern than other forms of discrimination. They are wrong. Some believe that because so many of the attacks on Labour under my leadership have been baseless that all\u0026nbspof these accusations are baseless. They are wrong. In the words of the great African-American writer and activist WEB Du Bois: “Our worst side has been so shamelessly emphasised that we are denying we have or ever had a worst side. In all sorts of ways we are hemmed in.”I take responsibility for this. When accusations have been made we have, at times, been too slow to respond or have responded evasively. We could have worked harder to engage with Jewish communities. It makes me cringe to know that, on a handful of occasions, I shared platforms with people who have made reprehensible statements and failed to challenge antisemitic remarks others have made in my presence. On at least one occasion I failed to recognise what I now see were clear antisemitic tropes in a mural. I deeply regret the offence this has caused. There are many things I am attacked for having done that I make no apology for. But these apologies I own. They were my mistakes. And the apology comes not from a point of weakness but strength because I can do better.The Labour party isn’t perfect. But it’s still the party of justice, equality and inclusion. It’s the party that has sent more women, black, Asian and Muslim MPs to parliament than any other. It’s the party that introduced the first Race Relations Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, hate crimes legislation and commissioned the Macpherson report. That is our history. That is our tradition. Those are not only our founding principles but our guiding principles. And that will be our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/495be7cc8998840d67fe69cc892f561277a83d84/59_253_3323_1993/master/3323.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fce4ca0e14ccf35ea1a1423a64bf47d","title":"a level results raise policy questions but first lets recognise achievement","story":"Despite the upheaval of the redesigned qualifications, many trends persistWe all know coverage of exam results day is fairly formulaic. Pictures of teenagers jumping up in the air clutching pieces of paper, stories about twins with a string of A*s who are now off to Cambridge, and a parade of people trying to explain all the changes that have happened that year and how it is now all different to before.Students receiving their A-level results on Thursday will be the first to do so in the latest wave of redesigned qualifications in England. The changes, which began during Michael Gove’s tenure at the Department for Education, mean a move away from modular qualifications and coursework towards linear assessment at the end of two years of study – largely through examinations.This year, subjects such as geography, modern foreign languages and music join the likes of English, the sciences, and art and design in being assessed in this way. The new qualifications are designed to better meet the needs of universities and employers.Despite the changes, many of the trends that we have seen in recent years persist. Girls continue to outperform boys in most subjects, the notable exceptions being mathematics and chemistry. There are large disparities in entry rates, around four-fifths of entries to physics are from boys, in English literature just one-fifth are.For many students, results day will be less about reflecting on what they have achieved and more about determining what happens next – whether they go to university, which university they will attend, and which course they will take. But for a growing number of students that uncertainty was removed long before they opened their results.This inevitably raised concerns that without the incentive of meeting a university offer, some students may not strive for the highest grades possible. That may well have happened in some cases, but at a national level the proportion of entrants achieving an A* or A is largely unchanged, although there has been a slight dip in the very highest grade. It does however, raise questions about how our universities admissions system should operate.But overall these are concerns for policymakers. For now, let’s recognise what students and teachers have achieved through the recent upheaval.Jon Andrews is deputy head of research at the Education Policy Institute"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7873f78ddf4f751cf77d4fc1513dc7c37007d6d4/0_137_4097_2458/master/4097.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e48166a97262588aec8de71462ebadf9","title":"most polluting woodburner fuels due to get the chop","story":"Environment secretary Michael Gove to banish house coal to curb harmful emissionsMichael Gove, the environment secretary, is due to confirm plans to ban the sale of the most-polluting fuels for domestic wood burners in an attempt to cut harmful emissions.The sale of traditional house coal will be phased out under proposals set out in the government’s draft clean air strategy in May, which are expected to be confirmed by Gove’s department on Friday.Restrictions are also expected to be placed on the sale of wet wood, particularly in urban areas. Burning wood before it has been properly dried releases more of the damaging particulates that contribute to air pollution.The government will also tighten standards on solid fuels, forcing manufacturers to cut down on sulphur emissions and ensure only the cleanest stoves are sold.The government believes the proposals will prevent 8,000 tonnes of harmful particulates entering the atmosphere each year.The clean air strategy is a response to an EU directive on cutting harmful emissions. As well as stricter rules on wood burning, it included separate plans to reduce emissions of ammonia from farms and dust from vehicle tyres and brakes.When the draft clean air strategy was published in May, Labour described it as “hugely disappointing”.The health costs of toxic air are estimated at £20bn a year by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.The new rules are the latest example of Gove’s interventionist approach to tackling environmental challenges, which has included proposed bans on cotton buds and plastic straws.The environment secretary’s attempt to restrict the use of polluting fuels were recently ridiculed by Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who joked in a speech about regulations on “wood-burning Goves”.Truss, who co-founded the liberal Tory thinktank Freer, said: “Government’s role should not be to tell us what our tastes should be. Too often we’re hearing about not drinking too much, eating too many doughnuts, drinking from disposable cups through plastic straws or enjoying the warm glow of our wood-burning Goves – I mean stoves.“I can see their point: there’s enough hot air and smoke at the environment department already.”The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has suggested that he could go further than Gove and ban wood-burning stoves altogether in the capital.Areeba Hamid, of Greenpeace’s clean air campaign, said: “Limiting the use of wood-burning stoves will help reduce harmful particulate pollution but it is only one part of solving the air pollution crisis.“Transport, in particular diesel vehicles, is responsible for the majority of air pollution on our streets and unless they are tackled as a priority, we cannot expect dramatic improvements in the UK’s air quality.”She called for the introduction of clean air zones across the country and the phasing out of the internal combustion engine by 2030.Gove, who campaigned for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, has repeatedly insisted that leaving the EU will not mean dismantling Britain’s environmental standards.Unlike his pro-leave colleagues David Davis and Boris Johnson, he has chosen to accept Theresa May’s Chequers strategy. Gove has staunchly defended the prime minister’s approach, which proposes a “common rulebook” for key export industries, including agrifoods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/676f2b1948d80f997711645abd15e5aaf3749546/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3966e4feed2917404fca21928c1bf737","title":"the best childrens shoes for autumn in pictures","story":"Fabulous footwear that kids will love"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e65447d4a01a2f79fc64ad458e4b020629a02775/0_0_6000_8000/master/6000.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82e8ad9f8f90812ed9a872f60b88107e 1760w","title":"why dev patel in dickens could change film for ever","story":"The actor will play David Copperfield in a forthcoming adaptation of the 1850 novel. Is cinema finally ready to ignore ethnicity in casting?Like most cheap paperbacks of David Copperfield, my battered old copy features a cover illustration of its eponymous hero as a boy: rosy-cheeked and blue-eyed under a nest of golden ringlets. (The artist gets it a bit wrong with the cruel smile, more horror movie kid than darling innocent, but hey ho.)On dustjackets and on screen, David Copperfield has been pale and posh ever since Charles Dickens published the novel he called his “favourite child” in 1850. (The BBC’s 1999 adaptation starred a pre-Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe.) But, in a landmark instance of “colour-blind” casting, Dev Patel, a Londoner of Indian heritage, is to play Copperfield in a new film by Veep’s Armando Iannucci.On the phone from the Ealing Studios set of The Personal History of David Copperfield (the film is out next year) producer Kevin Loader tells me that Patel was simply the right person for the job. “In all our conversations, we never spoke about another actor to play our lead than Dev,” he explains. “We often have lists for parts, but we never had a list for David Copperfield.”You can see why Patel is perfect. Dickens’s story is the tale of an orphaned boy making his way in the world and finding himself as a man. That is precisely the kind of innocence and experience story in which the Slumdog Millionaire and Lion actor shines – with all that boyish eagerness and puppy dog warmth.But it is not just Patel. The cast of The Personal History of David Copperfield resembles the top deck of a bus in any big British city. Benedict Wong is Mr Wickfield. Rosalind Eleazar plays Copperfield’s true love, saintly Agnes. Dastardly Steerforth is portrayed by a white Welsh actor (Aneurin Barnard) with a Nigerian-born Brit, Nikki Amuka-Bird, as his mother, Mrs Steerforth.“Armando always knew he wanted Dev,” says Loader. “Once you realise that, then you’re making a statement about the fact that you’re going to cast actors who are capable of embodying the character as perfectly as possible, regardless of their ethnicity. I was standing on the side of the set the other day, watching a scene between three of the younger characters. I suddenly realised I was watching three young black British actors in a Dickens adaptation, none of which were written as black characters. And it didn’t seem odd. It’s just another scene in the film.”Loader makes the point that London in the 1840s was more erse than costume dramas tend to depict. “London was the centre of a huge global empire and was full of everybody. Just as it’s a global city now. Traditionally, Dickens adaptations haven’t reflected that.”David Copperfield might be a blip, or perhaps we will look back and say it redefined the casting status quo in British film. Theatre audiences have been happily watching actors who don’t match the ethnicity of their characters for years, although not without controversy. Last week, Beverley Knight defended her right to play Emmeline Pankhurst in a new suffragette musical in London’s West End. Two years ago, JK Rowling called people who criticised the casting of Noma Dumezweni as Hermione in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child “racists” – pointing out that she never specified the ethnicity of Hogwarts’ clever clogs.On stage, “colour blind” has often been used to describe casting that ignores ethnicity. But it is a term that many actors of colour reject, since it is impossible for audiences to suddenly become blind to race, as the Shakespearean actor Debra Ann Byrd explained in a  interview last year. Loader has been using the phrase “colour inclusive”. I ask him why film has lagged behind theatre in erse casting. “I’m sure it’s something to do with that feeling behind it somewhere that photography tells the truth. Film seems a kind of realist medium to lots of people, which is odd, because most films are fantasies these days.”When you stop to think about it, the logic of literal casting quickly comes unstuck. In the upcoming drama Mary Queen of Scots, the Irish actor Saoirse Ronan is playing Mary no one would argue that her Irishness is damaging to authenticity. (To be truly accurate, the role would require the casting of a Scottish actor mostly raised in France). In fact, Mary Queen of Scots is another film with casting that crosses ethnicity lines, with British-Chinese actor Gemma Chan playing Mary’s jailer, the powerful aristocrat Bess of Hardwick.Femi Oguns is an agent who opened the Identity School of Acting in 2003, frustrated at the lack of opportunities for black and ethnic-minority actors its alumni include John Boyega and Chewing Gum’s Michaela Coel. Oguns then set up a talent agency, the Identity Agency Group. He tells me he is seeing “more scripts than ever” being produced with non-traditional casting. “For this to happen in narratives where the race of a character isn’t specific to the plot or pivotal in their portrayal is a wonderful step forward. I believe audiences are far more accepting of this than we perhaps give them credit for. Suspension of disbelief kicks in fairly soon after the opening credits. Some of it still errs on the side of being gimmicky, but we have seen a real appetite for change.” Nevertheless, he adds, scripts featuring black and ethnic-minority characters are often depressingly stereotypical. “We end up with the same old stories over and over. Gang violence in inner-city London, religious extremism, FGM, drug dealing, terrorism. There’s no light and shade in what we are afforded, there’s no space for it, therefore cliches are king. We are starting to see change at the top, we are seeing complexity come through. It’s slow going, but I am hopeful we are moving in the right direction.”Colette, a new biopic of the French writer starring Keira Knightley and directed by Wash Westmoreland, features two actors of colour playing historical figures who were white in real life: Asian-Brit Ray Panthaki and the black actor Johnny K Palmer. Additionally, a trans man, Jake Graf, has been cast in a cisgender role, while the trans actor Rebecca Root plays a cisgender woman. There was also a trans consultant on the film.Colette’s producer, Elizabeth Karlsen, tells me that the casting felt right in the context of the rule-breaking, convention-busting times in which Colette lived. “We just wanted to be outside the box like Colette was as a person. And just trying to change things.” What term has she be using to describe the film’s casting? “What you really want the word to be is ‘casting’,” she says dryly. “But we’re still in a world where you have to define it as something different. Hopefully one day that won’t be the space we’re in.”At the same time, however, Hollywood whitewashing has become toxic. Last year, Ed Skrein pulled out of playing an Asian-American character in the Hellboy reboot. Scarlett Johansson was criticised for playing a character in the Hollywood version of Japanese anime Ghost in the Shell. Double standards? Not when you consider how few opportunities there are for actors of colour without white actors coming along and hoovering up the decent parts.Loader tells me that David Copperfield isn’t about colour-conscious casting he just wants people to accept the actors as playing their characters. “It’s not a book about racial politics and we’re not trying to make a version of it that comments on racial politics. We’re just trying to make a version that comments on the ersity of humanity I suppose.”I ask him if the casting isn’t just a little bit calculated? British film feeds us an endless diet of bonnets and breeches now here comes a headline-grabbing Dickens, making the genre fresh and accessible for a contemporary audience. “No,” he insists. “It wasn’t done cynically in that way. I think we felt this was how you’d get the best cast more than anything else. And suddenly you can have Benedict Wong coming in to play Mr Wickfield, and he’s hilarious. He wouldn’t have been cast in the BBC version of David Copperfield.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72ed91145ebaeb93f4760692935077c851ce3db3/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0e137b93cb8a9dc8f2868465c46a434","title":"la liga us deal 39th game premier league","story":"The English top flight has no plans to follow Spain’s lead by playing matches abroad but the American company behind the 15-year deal is determined to change that“I have a cupboard full of models as to how it could and couldn’t work,” Richard Scudamore said in 2008. Thankfully for the Premier League, the contents of its executive chairman’s cupboard were never fully revealed as plans to stage a 39th game in Asia or Australia were quickly consigned to history amid criticism from, among many others, Sir Alex Ferguson to Sepp Blatter.The announcement that La\u0026nbspLiga plans to host regular-season games in the United States as part of a 15-year partnership will, for many supporters, have brought back bad memories of the ill-conceived 39th\u0026nbspstep reportedly hatched by Scudamore and Rupert Murdoch’s associate Sir Rod Eddington. But while fans in England can breathe a sigh of relief for now, the chairman of Relevent – the American firm that has won the right to stage one Spanish league match thousands of miles from home every season until 2033 – has not ruled out a similar move in future.“We have always stated that we would love to have a Premier League game here but it never got beyond the boardroom,” says Charlie Stillitano. “It’s one of the things that we have talked to them about over the years. If something like the 39th game ever got off the ground, we would put ourselves forward for it.”Together with the Miami Dolphins owner, Stephen Ross, Stillitano has been the driving force behind Relevent’s attempts to build on the burgeoning market for the beautiful game in the US over the past decade. The latest edition of their International Champions Cup brainchild has seen 18 teams playing a series of pre-season friendlies spread over 22 venues but the new venture – described by La Liga as “an inflection point for soccer in the US and Canada” – represents a major breakthrough that could have major implications for the game as a whole.“It’s something we have been working on for the past year and a half. A lot of leagues are looking to catch up with the Premier League and Spain is trying to make its mark,” says Stillitano. “This is a bold move for La Liga but it shows their ambition. A lot of leagues talk but these guys have really put themselves out there because they think this is the best way to build their brand.”Yet within hours of the announcement on Thursday the critics were queueing up. David Aganzo, the president of the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE), strongly objected to the prospect of its members being asked to fly long-haul to play a regular-season match. “As per usual, La Liga has dispensed with the opinions of the players and has undertaken actions that only benefit them, regardless of the health or risks to the players, and even less the feelings of the following masses of the clubs who are being forced to compete in North America once a season,” he said in a statement. “Footballers are not currency that can be used in business to only benefit third parties.”Those fears are likely to fall on deaf ears, however. The league’s chief executive, Javier Tebas, has long been a proponent of attempting to increase the marketability of his product and is understood to have pressed ahead with the deal despite widespread opposition among clubs.Official approval has also yet to be granted by Fifa but provisional plans are already in place to host the inaugural match before the end of this season, with Miami the most likely destination given its large Hiic community and the success of the friendly between Real Madrid and Barcelona that was held in the city last year. A repeat of the clásico has already been ruled out, although Ross, who also owns the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami as well as the NFL franchise team, hinted on Thursday: “I think you might have heard very much of one of the teams. One of the bigger teams.”Stillitano adds: “They’re rumours. But it’s fair to say one of them has to be a recognisable team. If this builds and we do it right the first time, obviously by year three or four we could have two mid-level teams but we think the first couple have to be a team people in the States will recognise. There are four or five candidates in Spain – this wouldn’t work if you had two teams who are fighting against relegation, for example. But it will be this season, for sure. We have to look at schedules and work with the clubs but Mr Tebas is certainly committed to it, as is Mr Ross. We’re going to shoot for this year without question.”Relevent will also have access to the rights to La Liga when the league’s $120m-a-season deal with beIN Sports ends in 2020, as well as controlling merchandise and academy initiatives at grassroots level. However, with NBC having paid the equivalent of nearly $170m a season in 2015 to broadcast the Premier League, there is no doubt who is the market leader.Widespread opposition to the 39th game, which proposed an extra fixture for all 20 clubs being played at neutral venues around the world and all the implications that would have for a fair competition, made it a non-starter a decade ago. With Scudamore due to stand down by the end of 2018 after nearly 20 years at the helm, the Premier League currently has no plans to follow Spain’s example and is understood to have poured cold water over the prospect at a broadcasters’ briefing last week. But Stillitano insists that market forces could mean the prospect of English league matches taking place overseas is just around the corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0e0271d57ae9456dc90b056a259c91cc7e8ec94/0_301_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=485c7a6439221cb639cf647d021d7a0e","title":"super cup reaction and celtics champions league exit football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden and co on Atlético’s win over Madrid, European woe for Celtic and Bristol Rovers’ dubious half-time entertainmentRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Both sides are vulnerable in defence and dangerous in attack. Although beaten comfortably in the end, Huddersfield exposed Chelsea’s weakness to attacks down the wings last week and Arsenal may aim to do likewise, while David Luiz, in particular, will likely struggle to keep up with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the middle. But Chelsea’s midfield thrusters – who could include Eden Hazard from the start as well as N’Golo Kanté in all-new Roving Mode – could wreak havoc at the other end, especially if certain Arsenal midfielders remain dozy when it comes to defensive duties. That is something Unai Emery needs to change and he could start by picking Lucas Torreira instead of Granit Xhaka. Or he might consider deploying both in a midfield trio with Mattéo Guendouzi. But even that would probably not be enough to keep Chelsea at bay so Emery will most likely err on the side of adventure and start Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Mesut Özil and Aaron Ramsey in a difficult away assignment. Petr Cech is likely to start in goal at Stamford Bridge but how long can the manager persevere with a keeper less suited to his approach than the new signing Bernd Leno? PDAway from home against a meticulously well-drilled Crystal Palace side, Liverpool’s pacy forwards are unlikely to be given the freedom of the final third that West Ham so generously bestowed upon them by playing such a high defensive line last Sunday. Touted by many as the only side with enough about them to prevent another Manchester City procession to the title, Liverpool need to avoid stuttering against mid- to lower-end Premier League sides if they are to put any sort of dent in the 25-point gap that separated the sides at the end of least season. Jürgen Klopp’s men dropped 19 points against teams that finished in the bottom six last season, nine of them against the three teams who went on to be relegated. They can ill-afford such profligacy this time round if they are to mount anything resembling a vaguely serious title challenge and the manner of their performance away from home against a Crystal Palace side that made short work of much-vaunted Fulham last weekend could provide a portent of things to come for fans who remember last season. BGTwo months after winning promotion by beating Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final, Fulham return to Wembley with at least half a new team and knowing that their new arrivals must blend in fast. Spurs did not play especially well during their win over Newcastle on the opening day and, let’s be honest, Harry Kane’s World Cup Golden Boot was an anomaly, as the striker has not been on song for a while. But Mauricio Pochettino’s team should still be able to test the solidity of Fulham’s central defensive partnership, which may not be strong even when Callum Chambers and Maxime Le Marchand are fully settled in. PDWith Phil Jagielka beginning a three-match ban, Everton may look to Yerry Mina or Kurt Zouma to line up alongside Michael Keane in central defence when they host Southampton. Much will depend on the duo’s fitness and Mason Holgate could start if Marco Silva decides his new recruits are insufficiently fine-tuned. Despite the preponderance of central defenders at his disposal, Silva has insisted the 21-year-old is very much part of his plans for the coming season. What this means for Keane, rumoured to be surplus to requirements at the club in February, remains unclear but the England international’s days in the starting lineup look numbered. With the arrival of Lucas Digne also ramping up the pressure on Leighton Baines in the left-back position, it seems that Séamus Coleman is now the only Everton defender guaranteed his place in the side. As selection headaches faced by recent Everton managers go, it makes a refreshing change. BGNeil Warnock and Rafael Benítez have a fractious relationship that dates back to 2007, when Warnock’s Sheffield United were relegated from the Premier League and their manager criticised the then Liverpool manager for fielding a below-strength side that lost against the Blades’ fellow relegation strugglers Fulham in their penultimate match of the season, a full 18 days before their Champions League final against Milan. Warnock’s comments about what he perceived to be a lack of sportsmanship prompted a threat of legal action and the Cardiff City manager later said he would “never forgive Benítez for playing what wasn’t even a reserve team”. Three subsequent matches with the pair in adjacent technical areas have passed off without incident, but Warnock has a notoriously long memory. In the event of any perceived injustices being visited upon either Cardiff or Newcastle in south Wales on Saturday, an entertaining feud could be reignited. BGLeicester’s owners’ idea is a fair one – to renew their team so they control matches and cut opponents open surgically rather than try to blow them away with counterattacks. But questions remain about the timing – is that really the way do make the most of Jamie Vardy while he is still in his prime? – and, most of all, about the identity of the manager chosen to usher in the new way. Claude Puel could take encouragement from how his team played at Old Trafford because although they lacked sharpness up front they were far brighter than they had been during most of their matches towards the end of last season. They need to show continued improvement during the first home match of the season, against Wolves, otherwise more fans will start wondering why Puel was kept on over the summer. It would help if he did not make one of the strange selections that he sometimes throws in, like starting Daniel Amartey at right-back while Ricardo Pereira plays in midfield and Marc Albrighton and Rachid Ghezzal sit on the bench. PDThere has been much talk about the possible toll that European exertions could take on Burnley. But Watford’s season will be even more hampered by travel difficulty if they do not improve their abysmal away form. They have scored only one goal in their past 11 away matches, a miserable streak that began under Marco Silva. Javi Gracia has to find a way of getting his players to perform away as well as they did when comfortably beating Brighton at home last week. Burnley is a suitable place to start, with Sean Dyche’s side having demonstrated last season how a club’s position can be transformed by overcoming away sickness. PDThe ease with which Liverpool ran through West Ham’s plodding midfield was hugely concerning for Manuel Pellegrini, who could yet rue failing to buy a top defensive midfielder this summer. The inexperienced Declan Rice was taken off at half-time at Anfield but it could just as easily have been Mark Noble or Jack Wilshere who joined Pellegrini on the bench for the second half. It was a disheartening way to start the season and West Ham will need to improve in the centre of the park when Bournemouth visit the London Stadium on Saturday. Pellegrini wants to play on the front foot and is not short of attacking firepower, but perhaps his first tweak should be to ask Pedro Obiang to sit in front of the defence. JSChris Hughton was at a loss to explain Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion’s lifeless display against Watford last weekend and there will have to be a vast improvement when Manchester United visit the Amex Stadium on Sunday. United will be out for revenge after losing this fixture last season and Hughton is likely to make changes in a bid to get rid of any lingering pre-season rust, which could mean that there will be full debuts for Yves Bissouma and Alireza Jahanbakhsh. Bissouma had an impressive cameo against Watford and could give Brighton’s midfield greater presence, while Jahanbakhsh has the potential to sharpen up Hughton’s misfiring attack.

It is vital to break the vicious cycleHere is a new problem to keep you awake at night: could sleep deprivation be affecting your social life? Not in the sense that you’re too tired to go out – although it could mean that, too – but could your very sleeplessness be off-putting to other people?In another experiment, 1,000 people were asked to rate photographs of people – some in a sleep-deprived state – according to how socially attractive they seemed. The sleep-deprived people came off worse. And the researchers concluded that sleep-related alienation could “trigger the transmission of loneliness” – after viewing clips of sleep-deprived people, otherwise healthy and happy participants then felt lonelier.“We humans are a social species. Yet sleep deprivation can turn us into social lepers,” said Matthew Walker, a professor of psychology and neuroscience and the senior author of the study, who wrote the bestselling book Why We Sleep. “The less sleep you get, the less you want to socially interact. In turn, other people perceive you as more socially repulsive, further increasing the grave social-isolation impact of sleep loss. That vicious cycle may be a significant contributing factor to the public health crisis that is loneliness.”Last year, a study of 2,000 young adults by researchers at King’s College London found lonelier people had poorer-quality sleep, were more likely to feel tired and had more difficulty focusing on tasks during the day than those who didn’t report feeling lonely. “It could be that feeling you’re all on your own in the world, a fundamentally unsafe feeling, could make it difficult to have a restful night’s sleep,” says Timothy Matthews, a research associate at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London. “And that, in turn, could mean you’re not at your best and you don’t get the best out of your social interactions, which could increase feelings of loneliness.”There could be an evolutionary element, he says. “Some scientists believe that loneliness is part of our evolutionary heritage, because our ancestors would stick together in groups in order to succeed. If you have an aversion to being cut off from the group, that would have served an adaptive purpose. If you feel you’re alone, that’s comparable to feeling unsafe. The world seems a more threatening place and that perception could make it difficult to have a more restful sleep because you’re more on guard for your safety.”Could it be useful for people to keep in mind that poor sleep could be a reason for their feelings of loneliness? “Loneliness is really complex and you can’t put it down to one thing,” she says. “I think we would say it would be a factor, but we’d need to look at other factors, too.” Things such as health problems and economic status “are big factors in loneliness. If you have ill-health or you are worried about money, that is probably going to keep you up, so it can all become part of this vicious cycle.”But for some people experiencing loneliness, the idea that poor-quality sleep can be improved, and can reduce their social isolation, may be a wake-up call."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eabdbdc744f82428945038605759e604c18a4e0/1_0_2282_1370/master/2282.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de47b5d4b8848208b57198840f7cf7c0","title":"far righters james bond not on your team idris elba","story":"Katie Hopkins and Richard Spencer are upset at the idea of Idris Elba as 007. What makes them think the sexy, elitist spy is theirs to claim?Greetings, pop pickers – and you are cordially welcomed to an exciting new Lost in showbiz series. It is entitled You’re Wetting Your Pants About What Now?, and aims to showcase the pettier preoccupations of the far rightradical rightwhatever the free-speech snowflakes are demanding to be called this week. Now, you’d think these guys have a lot of big things to talk about. The clash of civilisations. The White House putsch. The fact you can’t say anything any more, even though they literally just said whatever it was. But it’s amazing how often the leading lights of wingnuttery become obsessed with sensationally trivial things.Only the other week, I saw Infowars starlet Paul Joseph Watson getting really upset about a temporary floating sculpture on the Serpentine in London’s Hyde Park. Poor Prison Plonker! On the one hand, you want to say: Dude, it’s great that you left your flat. It always feels to me like you’re 10 minutes off hiring a chief of staff, and I think that fresh air is a big part of staving off that inevitable moment.On the other hand: I’m sorry the sculpture hurt your feelings. But it’s just art. It can’t harm you. You don’t have to like it – not at all – but it’s going to be gone in a month or so, and you can still use the pedalos while it’s there. (Although, can you not go on them this weekend, because I’m going with my children. And whilst I’m mostly amused at the thought of them shouting: “THAT ISLAND’S LIKE ABNEY AND TEAL’S ISLAND!” while we drift past you shouting into your GoPro camera about men’s rights, it might be a bit worlds-colliding for me to handle while I’m pedalling.)But back to You’re Wetting Your Pants About What Now? Guess what this week’s big-wedge issue on the far right is. Is it some notional attack by “antifa” (ie anyone who disagrees with them)? Is it the hundreds of US news organisations opposing Donald Trump’s attacks on the press? No! It’s who might or might not play a pretend person in a movie. James Bond, to be precise, which in its current iteration is essentially a franchise about a man who has to have sex with as many beautiful women as he can in the world’s leading spa hotels. It’s like the Condé Nast Traveller version of Pokémon Go. But sexy, and with GCHQ top notes. And when the actor gets interviewed about it afterwards, they have to come off like the job’s slightly more gruelling than the Shackleton expedition.Anyway, news that Idris Elba is back in favour for the role is turning out to be one of the major plotlines in the twatosphere this week. Not only has Katie Hopkins made a video about it – more on that later – but American white supremacist Richard Spencer has devoted a lengthy and thundering tweetstorm (tweetsturm?) to it.I know what you’re thinking. Is the Fourth Reich actually here? Are all the institutions of a fully realised neo-Nazi utopia in place? Because if I were a white supremacist, I’d want to know every last person who didn’t seem like me had been rounded up before I saw my thought leader spending ONE SECOND of time having a view on who might play the lead role in a sexy spy movie. If I’ve told them once, I’ve told them a thousand times: it’s Lebensraum first, THEN you get around to having a view on who plays laser iPhones with Q.But we are where we are. For reasons which are really a matter for a trainee psychoanalyst, who plays James Bond is a big thing for Spencer. To this end, he has unleashed a series of thoughts so bovine that I’ll just give you one for a little flavour. “Make no mistake,” begins one of Richard’s mistakes, “a black James Bond would be an act of dispossession far greater than a flotilla of a million refugees.”OK … Aside from everything else – and there is a lot there – I can’t believe I’ve got to explain the absolute basics of the James Bond franchise to Richard Spencer. This thing really couldn’t be simpler or less opaque. It makes Jason Statham movies look like Mulholland Drive.Still, here goes: Richard? Richard??? What do you care what colour James Bond is? James Bond isn’t even on your team! YOU PLAY FOR SPECTRE, YES? If you’re not sure how your values align with those of that organisation, and not with those of say, Judi ruddy Dench, then let me help you. You believe democracy is a “passing fad”. You believe in highly non-mainstream world domination. And here’s the dead giveaway – Spectre is packed with actual Nazis! Blofeld literally sold secrets to the Third Reich. These. Are. Your. People.You know who isn’t your guy? Some elitist one-percenter in an Yves Saint Laurent dinner jacket who can’t go 50 miles in a high-performance sports car without shagging the help. How are you going to sell that to your incels? We all saw the footage from the Charlottesville rally – no sex is absolutely part of your side of the brand.Be honest, Richard. How do you see Bond working as a tiki-torchbearer for you lot? Let’s just stick a pin in the first reel of Skyfall, and try to picture one of your guys in the role. “Oh I’m sorry, I’m going to be unable to have sex with you in the shower of this seven-star Macau casino because a) I don’t like the look of Macau and b) Owing to what I believe to be a gland issue I feel self-conscious when I remove my buttoned-up white polo shirt and outsize pleat-front chinos.”Sorry, Richard, but at that point you’ve just lost the hard drive with the details of MI6’s entire undercover agent programme. Idris would have got the hard drive. He’d have had done what was expected of him in the shower (and done it well), then decoded some complicated cyberterrorism whatnot and relayed the breakdown of it back to London. Then sauntered off to have it out with Javier Bardem on that island that looks a bit like my flat after a Christmas party. I don’t see one of your lot getting it done, Richard. Waa waa waa, people are trying to replace us. Waa waa waa, can we stop for Cheetos.As for Katie Hopkins’s contribution to this absolute keystone of a debate, her video. What to say about this effort? As a filmmaker, she’s very like Leni Riefenstahl, except talentless and presumably filming in her garage. The production values are slightly lower than you might expect if you pressed record while your phone was in your pocket. It opens with Katie declaring: “No, Idris Elba, you cannot be James Bond” – an assertion to which the only response is: pretty sure that’s going to be up to Barbara Broccoli, not someone honking into the void somewhere in Devon.But clearly, there is a much bigger issue here. Namely, what is the point – WHAT IS THE POINT – of making a Bond-related alt-right video if you don’t use this golden opportunity to do a pastiche of Nancy Sinatra’s You Only Live Twice theme? It is the most open of all open goals. Think about it. Soaring strings. Cue titles. And then Katie’s voice warbling: “You own the libs twice …” Fine, I apologise for the fact that you’re going to have that as an earworm for the rest of the day. But honestly. HOW DID SHE MISS?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/880d6ada5c2cf075637efbb4d23ebc4ef41f234a/0_0_6122_3674/master/6122.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=081675e6bacce627bd936b327034ae13","title":"travel insurance medical expenses nationwide","story":"While in Malta my wife was diagnosed with lymphoma and advised to return home as soon as possible.

Co-written with Rick Nowels, later a Lana Del Rey and Lykke Li collaborator.Lush strings and bassy pianos on this classy 1989 primal scream. Hugely emo, parent-baiting lyrics, but gorgeous in its execution.A classy post-Vogue excursion into 90s R\u0026ampB. Stabs of house piano and synthesised strings propel us brilliantly into Madonna’s cavern of love.A starlit, star-brightened nursery rhyme that flutters gently into life, before becoming the first properly polished, distinctively Madonna-sounding pop song.Credit and interest are reappropriated playfully as metaphors in Madonna’s career-changing hit. Till-ringing pop hooks were never so much fun to play with again.Launching off from a West End Girls synthesiser sound (Madonna told Stuart Price “I fucking love the Pet Shop Boys” when she recognised the nod), this is a slice of Confessions pop perfection.Twisting the agonies of heartbreak into a song about hope for the future, this track’s pulsing house piano, gospel vocals and boxfresh Diplo production sound fantastic.More filter-sweeping gorgeousness from the mid-2000s. “Do you believe in love at first sight?  It’s an illusion, I don’t care,” she sings, thrillingly.Male-run record labels appropriated the V-word, but female pop stars didn’t, before Madonna, unless they were singing Christmas carols. Madonna reclaimed it, and then some.Childlike innocence rushes through the Like a Prayer album, but while Dear Jessie smothered itself in schmaltz, Cherish was all impish, forthright joy.Best-of extra tracks are rarely as dreamily sexy as this, adapted from a love letter sung to Lenny Kravitz by Prince collaborator Ingrid Chavez.In the midst of its parent album’s panting obviousness, Rain was Erotica’s most properly erogenous moment. The rain builds slowly, then pours, its “dark clouds bursting in a perfect sky”. Madonna’s vocals teem with longing too, first sounding full of hope, then full of welcome, moving to release.A song either about the power of dancing, or about a girl begging her boy to get into her groove sexually, as it were, to cement their relationship (“touch my body  move in time  now I know you’re mine”). Or both. It doesn’t matter. The whole confection’s irresistible.A rousing Rebel Heart single set after the apocalypse about the power of love. In it, a woman gives a man the fire, cover and light that he needs – a nice twist in a world turned to dust. Inspired by growing religious and political intolerance, Madonna’s lyrics and a skyscraping melody pack punches.Madonna’s best excursion into the sounds of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB, sampling the bassline from What You Need by USCanadian trio Main Source, with Dave Hall (Mary J Blige, Mariah Carey) as her co-writer. Contains some killer lines, both sneered or whispered: “I’m not your bitch  Don’t hang your shit on me”.Madonna’s a good agony aunt when it comes to men. “Put your love to the test”, she advises, not that she means trying out his satin sheets (“what happens when you’re not in bed?”, she adds sensibly). Get someone emotionally available, who can “lift you to your higher ground”. Horns and synths joyously fanfare this advice.A fabulous ascending-then-descending bassline bolsters one of Madonna’s most club-ready songs. Its lyric is also one of her most unforgiving, reprimanding a serial apologist. “You’re not half the man you think you are,” she sings, before her knockout blow arrives a verse later. “There’s more important things than hearing you speak.”Majestic, reflective and sung in a subdued style for Madonna, this meditation on fame with a Ballardian reference in its title soars quietly and gorgeously.“I had so many loversWho settled for the thrillOf basking in my spotlight,” float her words, without emotion. Then the most desperate lie arrives, sadder than anything: “I never felt so happy.”One of Madonna’s sparkliest imperial-period pop singles. It plays today like a pitch to those still not then believing in her: “I’ve had to work much harder than thisFor something I want, don’t try to resist me.” Escape was impossible anyway, we discover. “Don’t try to runI can keep up with you.”A glorious update of the blissfully simple sentiments of Holiday and Everybody, infused with a Daft Punk-like robotic swagger, courtesy of Mirwais’ production. Its unlikely inspiration was Madonna’s attendance at a Sting gig: she was moved at how physically his songs connected his fans. Bonus points for the way she sings “bourgeoisie”.Probably the best thing Madonna’s done in cinema, despite the mediocrity of the film that it’s from (At Close Range, directed by James Foley, who would later shoot Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed). Madonna’s lyrics for the bridge were written on the spot, giving the song’s incredible, stark atmosphere even more stunning, bruised drama.Written by the disco group Pure Energy and turned down by Phyllis Hyman and the Supremes’ Mary Wilson, Madonna and Jellybean Benitez’s take on this blissfully simple four minutes of summer has never lost its freshness or warmth. That stuttering bassline and those Latin drums help. Madonna played cowbell.Dark, orchestral ambient is a mood at which Madonna excels. Frozen marries the different temperatures of 90s pop stunningly: the faltering chill of William Orbit’s electronica with the dusty, cinematic heat of North African melodies and strings. The extremes are fair enough. Madonna’s character’s attempting the melting of a heart, after all.Made quickly as a B-side for Dick Tracy single Keep It Together, Vogue updated Salsoul disco brilliantly for the end of the century. It also made gay culture celebratory again after the crushing Aids decade (“everywhere you turn is heartacheit’s everywhere that you go”). It became the A-side soon enough.That title, and this whole glorious song, teem with imperative instructions to the older generation by the mid-80s Madonna’s time had truly come. Determination pulses in her no-nonsense vocals – her character’s going to keep her baby, she’s made up her mind – while that glorious string arrangement adds cinematic authority to an all-too-relatable, everyday drama.Curtis Muldoon’s 1972 album track Sepheryn sounds like a track destined for a Nuggets-style noughties’ psych-folk anthology. But after Madonna heard William Orbit’s demo of the track with singer Christine Leach, she adapted the melody, added a verse, and invoked absolute magic. One of her most joyous electronic pop singles.Madonna’s entire career in glitterball-brightened time travel. We filter-sweep from the disco sounds of late 70s clubs to the mashup phenomenon of the early 2000s, before ascending to another level entirely. An Abba sample could have been a death-knell. It was a career rejuvenator.Touchingly, this was Madonna’s first US top 10 hit. The young, untutored star is at her most gentle and beseeching here: “Just try to understandI’ve given all I can.” The song’s pure melody underlines how much she had already, and how much she would thereafter. Madonna still performs it regularly, and with reason.Madonna’s greatest single was written with Patrick Leonard in a day, just like a dream. Its lyrics play famously, with the euphoric possibilities within religion and sex, but they also explore ideas of vulnerability and power within its layers of sumptuous, immediate sound. Madonna’s character has “no choice” when she hears “your voice”, her vocals conveying wilful submissiveness with absolute tenderness. But she also has faith in herself: “you know I’ll take you there” is repeated like the Staple Singers’ early 70s mantra. Here, however, it transforms into a celebration of emotional, personal conviction. She is Madonna, after all.

But they make the rest of this album seem formulaicCertainly, the magazine profiles of the singer that have appeared since the terrorist attack have struck a new note of seriousness. One spent time exploring her mother’s love of 19th-century literature and her aunt’s friendship with Gloria Steinem and informed readers that Grande is not a nihilist – a useful clarification for anyone who felt Heidegger’s post-Nietzschean thinking underpinned the contents of her 2015 EP Christmas \u0026amp Chill. Another opened with a 400-word disquisition on the semantic importance of the height at which Grande wears her ever-present ponytail. Whatever you make of that kind of thing, it suggests that now may be an apposite moment for Grande to try out a more experimental kind of pop than the charming but unchallenging brand of EDM and R\u0026ampB-infused fizz with which she made her name.And that’s just what Sweetener offers, at least in part. Anyone with a passing knowledge of Pharrell Williams’s back catalogue knows that, as a producer, he is extraordinarily talented and rather mercurial, as capable of making formulaic music as he is of the kind of sonic risk-taking that powered Kelis’s Milkshake or Snoop Dogg’s Drop It Like It’s Hot. But something about this particular collaboration seems to have fired up his imagination. The half of Sweetener with his fingerprints on it represents a genuinely bold and exciting move on Grande’s part. It’s filled with tunes richer and more serpentine than your average millennial pop topline.On Borderline, Grande’s voice floats airily over a sinister, jarring chord sequence, not unlike the kind of thing that might have provided the hook in a dark old rave track. Even a song as ostensibly frothy as Successful shifts and twists unexpectedly in a way that suggests someone behind it is conversant with the work of 70s soul’s more expansive melodists. The lyrics, meanwhile, stick fast to Grande’s aim of providing light relief – “it feels good to be so young and hot” – rather than dwelling on the horror of what happened in Manchester. The latter topic seems to be addressed only glancingly and tangentially over the course of Sweetener, in the title of No Tears Left to Cry, the refrain of The Light Is Coming (“… to give back everything the darkness stole”) and in Breathin’s depiction of the singer in the grip of a panic attack.The album is packed with songs that blithely dispense with standard verse-chorus structures, that fling disparate musical influences together and seem to go out of their way to avoid cliche: the title track offers a bizarre, gripping splice of earthy Carole King-ish singer-songwriter piano ballad with Migos-inspired hip-hop, complete with onomatopoeic vocal interjections. In a world where a vast tranche of mainstream pop seems to be made using a checklist of sounds and effects, there is something very striking about the blue-sky thinking behind The Light Is Coming: a distorted snatch of dialogue from a news report about an angry rightwing crowd in rural Pennsylvania protesting against Obamacare runs throughout the rhythm track jitters and glitches, overlaid with whistling, ping-ponging 80s video game electronics the chorus is a playground chant, albeit with apocalyptic overtones.The only problem is that these collaborations throw the rest of Sweetener into an unforgiving light. The gulf in invention between, say, Get Well Soon – a brave lyrical exploration of Grande’s mental health set to spiralling analogue synthesisers and lush multi-tracked vocal harmonies – and the saccharine ballad Better Off is pretty gaping. Clearly no one gave Swedish superproducer Max Martin the memo about avoiding cliches: his tracks deal exclusively in boilerplate stuff of varying degrees of quality. Driven by a skipping UK garage-inspired beat, No Tears Left to Cry is a high-quality example of the songwriter-for-hire’s art on the other hand, Everytime is entirely formulaic and the most arresting thing about God Is a Woman is its title.It makes for an uneven album that attempts to balance the desire to – as Grande put it – “make the weirdest thing we can” with something infinitely more straightforward. It sounds like the work of an artist torn between doing exactly what she pleases and, perhaps understandably under the circumstances, giving her audience what they want. But there’s no doubt which of these impulses is more successful artistically. It’s hard not to hope she throws caution completely to the wind next time: the world could use more pop music as imaginative as Sweetener’s highlights.Soundcloud insists that Mumdance’s latest project – this time with Irish musician James Kelly – is #metal. In fact, Bliss Signal is a euphoric, head-clearing rush of beats and guitar noise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f6a30d5b26101198083e8c9fb2469e4ce4bdae5/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e7a3130f5efaadffaf99def1d9fc6d","title":"the singers singer musicians pay tribute to aretha franklin","story":"Elton John, Cher, Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney and other stars pour admiration, respect and love on ‘icon of all icons’Musicians around the world have made emotional tributes to Aretha Franklin, the “queen of soul”, who died on Thursday aged 76.Singers including Britney Spears, Adele, Gloria Estefan, Usher, Willie Nelson and Mariah Carey were among whose words confirmed her appeal and influence across generations.Lady Gaga wrote on Twitter that Franklin was an “angel of music”.In a long post on Instagram, Elton John called her death “a blow for everybody who loves real music: Music from the heart, the soul and the Church. Her voice was unique, her piano playing underrated – she was one of my favourite pianists.”Cher said Franklin’s “one of a kind voice will be with us forever”.Paul McCartney called her “the Queen of our souls” and said “the memory of her greatness as a musician and a fine human being will live with us forever.”Mariah Carey, who performed with Franklin multiple times, shared several tweets in which she described Franklin as “my inspiration, my mentor and my friend”.“Aretha Franklin.

Mariam Munang took her bar professional training course (BPTC) at the University of Law, and is currently based in New York as an associate legal officer at the United Nations. Munang says that her time at the University of Law – which has 10 centres across the UK – gave her the skills and confidence to get to her current position. “I chose to study there because of its strong emphasis on honing practical legal skills, such as drafting and advocacy,” she says. “I prepare for trial in much the same way as I prepared for mock trials at the University of Law. The BPTC gave me the space and opportunity to make errors, learn from them, and hone my own style.”Baroness Shami Chakrabarti is one of many lawyers who choose to use their skills in the political world. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Law, where she is now a mentor to students. She’s a member of the House of Lords, a politician, a barrister and a former director of human rights group Liberty. “I am proud to be the shadow attorney general in a shadow cabinet of many lawyers and many more colleagues who champion human rights and the rule of law,” she says. “During my time at Liberty, we defeated proposals to lock people up for 42 days without charge, halted ID cards, and won important victories on issues like stop-and-search.”One of the proudest moments of her career, she says, came when the Human Rights Act was passed. “In a sense, there’s no such thing as human rights law, only a whole host of legal and policy areas that engage people’s human rights,” she says. “Human rights are a powerful shield against abuse of power.” Simon Firth, partner at Linklaters LLP and visiting professor, says teaching those at the start of their careers is one of the best aspects of his job. “I love explaining the principles of the subject I am covering,” he says. “The University of Law has a very practical approach to preparing students for legal practice. That means trainees are effective from the moment they start training contracts.” As graduation approaches, the university’s award-winning careers service offers students guidance on achieving ambitions – another step to set them up for success.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan graduated from the University of Law Guildford with Law Society finals, the predecessor to the LPC. “At the University of Law I really valued the support of my fellow students, my lecturers and my tutors,” he says. “They kept my motivation levels up through many long days and late nights of revision.”Khan, who grew up on a south London council estate, was a human rights lawyer before entering politics. In 2016, he won the largest personal mandate in British political history to become mayor of London. His legal background provided vital experience for the world of politics, he says. “I was a member of parliament for my home town in Tooting before becoming the mayor for all Londoners,” he says. “As a human rights lawyer, I defended people who were victims of discrimination and that made me more determined than ever to fight injustice wherever I see it.” Visit the University of Law for more information"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bdd1e9e219d6966ce3e1b5992cd79c012e680fa/248_1306_5685_3412/master/5685.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62b657dbf44f920493589129f9804df8","title":"sadiq khan london resilience forum must prepare no deal brexit food medicine shortages","story":"Mayor instructs resilience forum to assess impact of food and medicine shortagesSadiq Khan is to instruct the body tasked with planning for terrorism attacks and disasters such as the Grenfell Tower fire to start making preparations for a no-deal Brexit, to assess whether London could face potential shortages of medicines and food.The London mayor said the government was dragging its feet and leaving businesses and EU citizens in limbo by refusing to guarantee their rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Khan said he would ask the London resilience forum to assess the impact of no deal on the capital’s access to medicines, energy, food and emergency services, as well as on law and order. The forum is made up of 170 organisations including the emergency services, local authorities and the NHS.The mayor said the government was being “held hostage by the hard-Brexit zealots in parliament” that made a no-deal Brexit more likely.“If the government had taken a different approach to the negotiations this would never have been an option, but we are now left with no choice but to plan for a no-deal scenario,” he said.The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, underlined the risks of no deal on Thursday. Speaking to ITV News in The Hague, on the latest leg of his tour of EU countries, he said the implications of no deal would be “profound”.“We have to be prepared for that we don’t want that to happen, though. And it would be a mistake that we would regret for generations if we had a fissure – a messy, ugly orce,” he said.The remarks are very likely to infuriate hardline Tory Brexiters, who have insisted no deal would be manageable. Hunt also struck an upbeat tone about the likelihood of achieving a deal on the basis of the government’s Chequers proposals, saying he was “getting a very strong sense that people want to engage seriously”.Khan’s intervention comes as Whitehall civil servants prepare to publish a slew of technical notes in the coming days on the no-deal preparations being made by a number of departments.Papers slated for publication next week include financial services and life sciences. In some areas, such as ensuring the continuity of subsidy payments to farmers, the government is confident that it could secure continuity even in the event of no deal. But in others, such as the impact of the loss of EU “passporting rights” for British banks, the immediate impact is uncertain.Khan said he would launch a consultation for London businesses to determine areas where City Hall could help them prepare for Brexit eventualities, but added that it was already clear the biggest threat was to the rights of European employees, who have not had their status guaranteed in the event of no deal.“The government’s current offer of settled status relies on a successful outcome of the Brexit negotiations,” Khan said. “If talks were to break down, the three million EU citizens living in the UK, around 1 million of whom are Londoners, would have no guarantee that their rights to stay and work would be protected.“Businesses regularly report the difficulty they face in getting the talented workers they need, and to now threaten the Europeans they currently employ is completely and utterly reckless.”Theresa May has previously pledged that “EU citizens living lawfully in the UK today will be able to stay”, whatever the outcome of the negotiations, and government sources said their right to stay would not be in doubt in the event of no deal, although some reciprocal rights such as access to benefits would need to be negotiated if the December joint agreement with the EU collapsed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f63634edd3322766f5b575eaee52659d8b49dfad/0_107_4954_2973/master/4954.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2313012f2eb81aaf589e852d102ea967","title":"a level results doctor medical school sheffield university","story":"After missing the grades I needed for medical school, I found another way to realise my dream It was August 2007 I stood in the classroom, surrounded by my school friends, clutching the large brown envelope that contained my A-level results. I wanted to become a doctor and had the next five years of my life all planned out. I opened the envelope to find three As and two Bs staring back at me. My heart sank.Although by most standards I had done very well, a B in chemistry prevented me from studying medicine at Bristol and the second B, in biology, meant I wouldn’t be going to medical school at all. Suddenly the years I had set out ahead of me were empty and I had no idea what was going to happen. Although they tried, my friends and family couldn’t say anything to make the situation better. What was there to say? I’d got a very good set of A-level results. I received texts from my classmates, who were out in Liverpool celebrating, telling me to join them. “Everything happens for a reason,” they said. “It will all work out.” But I felt numb and couldn’t face anybody. This was a real failure and unfortunately no amount of quadruple vodkas surrounded by fun-loving Scousers was going to fix it. Staying at home while all my friends moved on was something I couldn’t face, so I chose a course through clearing at Sheffield University with the most relevance to medicine. Having a major knock to your confidence just before a new phase of your life isn’t ideal. It’s especially not ideal to study biomedical science and then be regularly asked if you’re a “failed medic”. But almost from the moment I walked through the lecture theatre doors, I knew Sheffield would be forever special to me. Pints that cost £1, Arctic Monkeys on repeat and as much gravy as you could handle - Yorkshire welcomed me with open arms. I threw myself into university life. I learned, in equal measure, about the molecular biology of cells and the best way to body paint for a fancy dress night out.In my final year, it was time to think about life after university. Naturally, I began to consider medicine again. I was worried that maybe I wasn’t meant to be a doctor. I knew I wanted to spend my life caring for people, and that a privilege like that wouldn’t come easily. Yet I knew I couldn’t make fear an excuse. My Sheffield friends convinced me to apply again. Degree results day came round and it was different this time. I found my candidate number and rolled my finger across the paper to find that all the hard work had paid off. I couldn’t believe it – I had managed to get the first-class degree that would get me into Bristol medical school. I am now a qualified doctor. I’ve survived my first two foundation years in hospital and have just started GP training. I can see that the failure I experienced all those years ago, and the unknown situation it forced me in to, enabled me to build resilience – the kind that is vital to work as a doctor under pressure in our NHS. I also hope that my journey has made me a more compassionate and understanding doctor as I move forward in my career. Although I wouldn’t usually recommend a prescription of copious amounts of Henderson’s relish, pies and Yorkshire ale to drown your sorrows, my life ersion gave me so many experiences I wouldn’t have had if things had gone differently that day in August.Things won’t go as expected for many receiving their exam results today. My advice would be that although it will be difficult to see at first, there are many paths that can take you to where you want to be. Things don’t always happen for a reason. Sometimes things just happen. I now know that it’s how you learn to deal with it and bounce back that is the most important thing. Yorkshire taught me that.

We had been interested in him because a player of Ben’s calibre is always on your radar but until this is all cleared up, and that includes the ECB disciplinary process, we wouldn’t even consider it.”It is thought the Cricket Disciplinary Commission, which acts independently under the auspices of the England and Wales Cricket Board, will convene in the coming days to discuss whether Stokes is guilty of bringing the game into disrepute but it could take months for it to reach a conclusion and decide on any action.The ECB will address winter plans if an official approach is made to Stokes. But the  understands a no objection certificate (NOC) would be issued by his employer to play a short stint in Australian domestic cricket. Stokes, who was born in Christchurch, New Zealand, played for Melbourne Renegades in early 2015. But Cricket Australia may block his return, not least because the success of the Big Bash has been attributed to its appeal to families including young children. In 2016 more than half of the spectators across the tournament were families.The Big Bash is so protective of its “family-friendly” brand that no return has been granted to the West Indies batsman Chris Gayle who caused outrage in 2016 when he made inappropriate comments in a pitchside television interview with Mel McLaughlin, a female broadcaster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24e83cf9b8782a16979bd7c53965d1a588d0cc51/116_136_3138_1883/master/3138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37179b1debde1157b8615e202b3a68ff","title":"noah lyles us sprinter birmingham 100m","story":"The king is dead. Long live the king? With Usain Bolt retired, athletics needs a new sprint hero. The brilliant\u0026nbspyoung American Noah Lyles reckons he has the talent and charisma to fill some of the 6ft\u0026nbsp5in hole left by the Jamaican.“I want to transcend the sport,” says Lyles, who runs in Britain for the first time at the Birmingham grand prix on Saturday. “Track and field in America isn’t that big until the Olympics comes around and I want to change that.”Lyles is certainly fast. Not only is he the quickest man over 100m and 200m this year but his personal bests – 9.88sec for 100m and 19.65 for 200m – are better than Bolt’s at the same stage (21 years and one month). However, he literally dreams of getting a lot quicker.“In 2016 I had a dream where I raced and the clock flashed 9.41 and I ran up to my mom and said: ‘Mom, I just ran 9.41,’” he says, laughing. “And she was like: ‘That’s nice, Noah.’ And then she turned around and said: “What did you just say? That’s a world record.’ But I do really think I can run 9.41. I don’t know when it’s going to happen but I’m going to try my best to do it.”Like Bolt, Lyles is a natural showman. When he raced in Doha in\u0026nbspMay he wore R2D2 socks and swung a pretend lightsaber to celebrate Star Wars day. A few weeks later in Eugene he put his hands in the air before the start and called for a “spirit bomb”, a move from the TV show Dragon Ball Z. And when he became the youngest man since 1984 to win the 100m at the US trials he wore Incredibles socks and celebrated with the Shoot dance, popularised by the video game Fortnite. For good measure Lyles is also a budding rapper and has a YouTube channel.His priority for now, though, is to prove himself as the top sprinter in the world – and make up for lost time having missed last year’s world championships in London due to a torn hamstring, which meant he never got to face Bolt.“Am I sad I didn’t get to race against him at least once? Yes. Maybe now I would have been able to challenge him at the end of his career but, if we’re talking about him in his heyday, I don’t think anyone could really challenge him besides Yohan Blake.”In Birmingham Lyles will race the 100m and believes he could run a personal best of around 9.85sec. However he accepts it will be tough against a stacked field that includes 14 men who have gone under 10 seconds, including the world 60m record holder, Christian Coleman, as well as\u0026nbspZharnel Hughes and Reece Prescod, the European 100m gold and silver medallists.“I’m really happy for Zharnel because I’ve been watching him for a few years,” Lyles says. “He’s been on that cusp of breaking 10 seconds for the 100m. This year he finally did it and he actually did it on me in Jamaica. I felt really happy for him. I hadn’t heard of Prescod before this year. He has shocked me a little. But it’s great that we have all these athletes facing-off in big races. The\u0026nbspsport has a past history of not having the top-tier guys go off against each other, but that’s what people want to see.”Lyles’s best distance is clearly the 200m – only seven men in history have run faster than his PB of 19.65 – but he admits it is much tougher in the 100m. “I can’t say I am the dominant figure because I do get beat in the 100m but I am OK with that because it makes the races more exciting,” he says.“If somebody dominates the whole time people might get a little bit turned off. But when they see competitive rivalry, people get more excited. I get really excited when people talk others up. I say: ‘OK, I’ve got some work to do. I’ve got to change some minds.’”Lyles does not look like a sprinter. He is only 5ft\u0026nbsp10in and sinewy rather than ripped but he has excellent genes, given his father, Kevin, was a 45.01sec 400m runner and his mother, Keisha, was an All‑American runner at college, and he has a ridiculously fast finish.“I don’t have big bulging muscles,” he concedes. “And it’s harder for me to get those first few steps out than some of the other guys. But my ability to turn over is very fast – and I have a unique ability to have a lot of endurance and be able to hold my top-end for longer than most people can.”That is something the large Birmingham crowd – and his rivals – are probably about to find out.Noah Lyles will compete in the 100m at the Müller Grand Prix Birmingham on Saturday.

Following a defensive performance showing few of the frailties which have plagued the Saints in their past two games, a seven-minute spell yielded 16 unanswered points.While Wakefield twice pulled that back to within a score after half-time, it always felt as though the Saints had Trinity at arm’s length. Visits to Wakefield have become increasingly reliable acid tests for sides in recent years, though this defeat for Trinity now all but ends their hopes of a play-off push this season.That should not necessarily be considered a failure given their considerably lower spend than most sides. “We’ve lost a lot of close games this year and it’s frustrating,” their coach, Chris Chester, lamented. “That spell in the first half saw us come up with six errors in nine sets.”The game was scoreless for 25 minutes before two tries for Tommy Makinson – the winger who continues to look like a serious contender for England honours this autumn – plus Jonny Lomax’s first of the night made it 16-0 at the break. Trinity, much to their credit, hit back when Kyle Wood and Pauli Pauli crossed.But in the 10-minute period when Trinity were without Craig Huby – in the sin-bin – Theo Fages re-established a two-score lead. That was again cut when Bill Tupou scythed through but the visitors finished the stronger, tries for Luke Douglas and Regan Grace confirming restoration of their 10-point lead at the top of the table."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4a35c8297e406892995c790f605e171b6776464/1070_705_3186_1913/master/3186.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea5142e2a562eebcd6ead56130b04cd","title":"the pin review dazzling comedy show edinburgh festival","story":"Pleasance Courtyard, EdinburghTerrific skits and inventive gags mean the laughs come thick and fast in a delightful new hour from the sketch duoCleverness comes as standard from sketch duo the Pin. In the past, they have never quite shaken the suspicion of smugness and a sense, perhaps, that we’re buying all that flamboyant invention at the expense of warmth. No such danger with their new show, Backstage, which is simultaneously one of the most dazzling comedy shows in Edinburgh and a complete hoot. It’s probably no coincidence that here, more pronounced than before, Alex Owen and Ben Ashenden embrace the straight manfunny man dichotomy they have hitherto resisted.The conceit is that the Pin play second fiddle to another double act, Philip and Robin. After their support slot, Owen and Ashenden repair backstage to practise their sketches, snark about the audience and fantasise about taking over at the top of the bill. What follows is a giddy slice of Noises Off-style knockabout, overlaid with the Pin’s signature meta-comedy, as Owen, Ashenden, Philip and Robin chase one another on stage and off, identities get scrambled and a chair on the stage miraculously reappears – and vanishes from – behind the scenes.It’s as much comic play as sketch show, even while Owen and Ashenden slot in some terrific free-standing skits. The whistling joke is one for the ages the Scandi-noir spoof is irresistibly silly. And, like most of the Pin’s material, wholly surprising. They are operating at such a high level of inventiveness, they can afford to toy – as per the gag about Owen’s favourite Shakespeare play – with the audience’s expectations of a punchline. We are forever tantalised at the prospect of the next volte-face – it’s like watching a magic show.What’s delightful is how all this tricksiness is embedded in the cosily familiar conventions of vaudevillian farce. As an act, Philip and Robin are old-school – and so, too, is the Pin’s backstage caper, with slapstick fall guys bundled into cupboards and limbs extending from behind screens. There’s something satisfying, too, about watching Owen embrace his inner gormless idiot, while Ashenden takes on the exasperated foreman role, without stinting on the laughs – of which there are loads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/931536eddd9d327f9ea723721af78cbc4377e782/0_97_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42c3ad6482a125b7b5dbb6e9b079f746","title":"elon musk says past year has been excruciating and worst is yet to come","story":"In emotional interview, Tesla founder says he has endured ‘the most difficult and painful’ time of his career Elon Musk has said the past year of his professional life has been “excruciating” and that stress over his business had caused his health to deteriorate.In an emotional interview with the New York Times the founder of electric car maker Tesla, also revealed that the pressures of work had caused him to spend his birthday stuck in the Tesla factory and almost miss his brother’s wedding.“This past year has been the most difficult and painful year of my career,” he said in the interview.Musk, whose company posted a record $709.6m net loss in the first quarter of this year while struggling to manufacture large numbers of its Model 3 mass-market electric car, said he had been working up to 120 hours a week and as a result his health had been “not great” and his friends had been worried about him.Musk said there were times he didn’t leave the factory for three or four days at a time and days when he didn’t go outside.He added that he spent the entire 24 hours of his 47th birthday in June at work and flew directly to his brother’s wedding, where he was due to be best man, from work, arriving two hours before the ceremony and leaving immediately afterwards.Musk sparked a furore in the markets, the media and among investors earlier this month when he tweeted his intentions to take his publicly-traded company private, with the assurance: “Funding secured”.Lawyers have warned that his tweet may have broken 14e-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which prohibits publicly traded companies from announcing plans to buy or sell securities if executives don’t intend to complete, don’t have the means to complete, or are trying to manipulate the stock price.In the interview with the New York Times, Musk blamed short-sellers, from whom he said he anticipated “a few months of extreme torture”.“I thought the worst of it was over,” he told the New York Times. “But from a personal standpoint, the worst is yet to come.”Musk, who is a controversial figure, has drawn further criticism this year for his tweets. Last month he launched an extraordinary attack on one of the British ers involved in the rescue of 12 boys and their football coach who were trapped in a cave in Thailand, baselessly calling the er a “pedo” on Twitter.In June, Musk caused outrage when he responded to a tweet from a woman who claimed Musk had used her father’s unicorn artwork on Tesla merchandise without compensation or attribution, by telling her “He can sue for money if he wants, but that’s kinda lame”. Musk later settled the dispute with the artist.Musk has also lashed out at both the media and analysts from large Wall Street banks in recent months, calling questions from analysts “boring, bonehead questions” and suggesting he would start a website to rank the credibility of inidual journalists, after Tesla received negative press coverage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c95d7742059bd3f8609504950a88fd397d4fe88/0_354_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b352b3e059e6ee16c130814839e432f","title":"holland netherlands zeeland beach holiday with my father","story":"As a child, Caroline van Keeken hated family trips to this sleepy coast. But it’s now a popular holiday destination – and it turns out travelling with her livewire father is terrific funTwelve years ago, my father bought a holiday home in Zeeland, a coastal province in the southwestern Netherlands. Since then he only ever spends time at home – in Amsterdam – when his plants need watering.According to the latest figures, over half of all tourists visiting the coast of Zeeland are Dutch. As a child, I spent many a holiday here. However, during these brief escapes to Zeeland I always longed to escape back to Amsterdam. I did not know what to do with myself amid the endless, deathly quiet fields of maize, and the locals my age whose dialect I could not understand. Besides, I had secret but no less serious plans to launch an international career as the Dutch Britney Spears, so these seaside holidays did not suit me.And then there was my father. I always preferred to walk a few steps ahead of him so as not to get involved in the random conversations he struck up with complete strangers. Or not to be associated with him when he burst into song or dance, or both. But I’m all grown up now. I get this.Time for two days in Zeeland. Destination: the small village of Waterlandkerkje. The train from Amsterdam Central to Vlissingen takes three hours. The connecting boat to Breskens, across the Westerschelde, 30 minutes. Zeeland is an archipelago of peninsulas, all connected by bridges and tunnels. This southernmost part of Zeeland I am going to is known as Zeeuws-Vlaanderen and borders Belgium.I take the boat. On the aft deck I hear mostly German, but also some English and Flemish. Many of my fellow travellers are families with young children. And there are older couples, too. They are visiting Zeeland for its beautiful beaches, bike rides by the water, and fresh fish. For its peace and quiet, more than anything. But right now, in peak season, calm is not immediately apparent. Tourism is growing in Zeeland. Good news for those renting out holiday homes, such as ones directly on the beach for instance, on Noord-Beveland or Walcheren, and for campsite owners. Not so much for those looking for peace and quiet. Unless you know where you are going.My father is waiting for me: large white cap, sunglasses and waving both arms above his head while calling out my name. On our way to the house, he talks animatedly about his neighbour’s horse, which he found grazing in his garden the previous week. And about a nearby farmer who keeps an eye on his stabled cows via webcam. He’s called Frank, and I should definitely meet him.In the garden, we spend a long time watching a blackbird. “Isn’t it beautiful,” my father says. “It’s lording it over all the other birds.” The neighbours opposite are driving a tractor across the land they yell something and my father raises his hand. Other than that it’s quiet. “This is nothing like Amsterdam.”It is Wednesday morning and already quite warm when we drive 20 minutes to the beach at Cadzand. But first we stop off in Oostburg for a Zeeuwse bolus pastry at Bakkerij ‘t Bakkertje (“Bakery the Bakery”). They may have missed out on this year’s Best Bolus award, but their pastries are a household name. Baker Tamara Waebeke explains that they are selling some 200 a day this summer. “And it’s just bread dough with cinnamon and sugar.”Passing vast fields of maize, sugar beet, onions, potatoes and grain on either side, we drive towards the seaside resort. Over the past five years, the locals have witnessed huge changes here. From a sleepy little village by the coast, Cadzand has been transformed into one of the most popular holiday destinations in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, and now has a few large hotels. The beach is crawling with sandcastle builders, kite flyers, surfers and children covered in ice-cream, straddling the various stages between euphoria and meltdown.“Let’s go.” My father wants to take me to Het Zwin, a nature reserve that crosses into Belgium about a mile down the road. It is a beach plain behind the dunes, and directly connected to the sea. At high tide, sea water enters Het Zwin via a channel. In this secluded spot, nature-lovers armed with binoculars go in search of plants and birds unique to this area. The sandy beach here is in sharp contrast with that of Cadzand. Here there is only a single beach pavilion to be found (De Zeemeeuw, which serves a good lunch) and just a few elderly couples, the odd dog and small groups of friends.Het Zwin is a place where you can find shark’s teeth on the sand as a result of shifting earth plates and beach replenishment. Today we fail to spot any, but we do see a trio behind a metal detector. André van Es hails from the east of the Netherlands and has been holidaying in Zeeland for 20 years. He is looking for ammunition from bunkers in the dunes that were blown up after the second world war. “This is my way of relaxing,” Van Es explains. “Wonderful”, my father says.Back in the car, we listen to the song Zoutelande by Zeeland band Bløf on the radio. Thanks to this summer hit, quite a few Dutch people have descended on the eponymous village this year, in search of seaside romance and the beach house mentioned in the lyrics. My father winds down the car window and treats passing cyclists to a concert.On Thursday we drive to Groede, 15 minutes away. Down narrow country roads we trudge behind slow tractors. The air is thick with the scent of leek. My father thinks he spots Frank, the webcam farmer, in a garage. He parks in front of the door, cups his hands around his mouth and yells into the empty space: “Fraaank!” He keeps this up for several minutes. I nod politely at two passersby. In Groede, we walk around the small village centre, past houses with picturesque facades, and along a street where artisanal workshops from the early 20th century have been renovated.On the square in front of the church we have coffee at De Drie Koningen. Followed not long after by a glass of their celebrated beer, brewed on site. Next stop: nearby Breskens, for fresh fish at fishmonger Erasmus in the port, where they have stretched the definition of “mussel time”. The official Dutch season starts in August and finishes in April.“The Zeeland mussel season will go on a little longer,” the woman at the fishmonger’s smiles mysteriously.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

This documentary explores that question by following two women trying to find the families who gave them up for adoptionThe reason 26-year-old Ria wants to meet her birth mother, she says, is to “find out if I was brought into this world with love”. Searching for Mum: Sri Lanka (BBC Two) follows two women through the emotional and draining process of attempting to track down the families who gave them up for adoption in a country far away from the one in which they grew up. It is as frustrating as it is moving, touching on a wider scandal about enforced adoptions in Sri Lanka and the use of falsified documents to cover up coercion. It is also an honest and brave story about what it means to know one’s roots, and a complex examination of why many people consider this an essential part of their being.Ria’s story is the more straightforward, if only in comparison to the one with which it is paired. She has lived with her adoptive parents in Inverness since she was three weeks old. “I stuck out like a sore thumb, but I was completely happy,” she says of her childhood. Nevertheless, not knowing why she was given up for adoption has needled her, as has the paperwork that says her birth mother wants no contact. Articulate, thoughtful and wary, Ria explains that she feels stuck between two countries and two identities: “It doesn’t necessarily upset me, but it’s there.”With the help of Siri, a professional who makes a career out of navigating Sri Lankan paperwork and bureaucracy for adopted children seeking their parents, and after a few dead ends, Ria eventually comes to the village of her birth family. An uncle comes out to greet her, then her grandfather. She must wait until the next day to meet her mother, but when the moment comes it is simple, wordless and deeply moving. Sumitra, her mother, explains through tears why Ria had to be adopted. The father had left her and she was told they were too poor to care for her. She did not remember signing the paperwork, she said. She cried for three months after her daughter was taken. In the end, Ria finds what appears to be a form of peace.Rebecca’s story is less linear, less complete. She has been searching for her roots for a long time, having only discovered she was adopted when she was eight she found the papers, by mistake, in an airing cupboard. She is frustrated by a lack of records at every turn. Her birth does not appear to have been registered, as was often the way with unmarried mothers. She is angry at her adoptive parents, desperate for a connection to where she was born, almost unbearably optimistic in the face of setback after setback. Her story ends with a potential family. Her sense that maybe these are familiar eyes, that they have a “connection”, is shattered by a DNA test that proves otherwise. I hope that next week she finds some resolution, in whatever form it may take.Fans of the Ross Kemp school of television – hard men meet other hard men under circumstances of high stress, personal danger and frantic directions – will have been enjoying Meet the Drug Lords: Inside the Real Narcos (Channel 4), which ends on a surprisingly balanced note this week. Jason Fox – formerly of special forces, the host of SAS: Who Dares Wins and the kind of man that women of a certain age may refer to as “dishy” – has had incredible access to the day-to-day business of the real-life South American narcos who supply much of the world’s cocaine.It is high-octane and exhilarating, showing Fox and his crew in genuinely terrifying situations, such as when they are interrupted during an interview with a cocaine chef in a secret lab and he must, in military terms, peg it as quickly as possible. It also amps up the action-movie stuff, as helicopters on loan from the US air force are used to decimate a cocaine factory in the jungle.But it is not the showier scenes that stand out. Fox has a way with the people he meets: he asks the right kinds of questions he is sympathetic, understanding and curious. He talks to hitmen and discovers that, for all their posturing, they can’t sleep at night. He talks to smugglers, risking their lives every day for tiny sums of money, finding out why they do it, that many keep it secret from their families. It adds an extra layer of meaning to the question of the value of cocaine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8292b60a352c3fd51bdf0825dfa58cb3193a8870/0_217_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2c0a563d2378238042b61694f1709e8","title":"uk playwrights condemn bombing of gaza theatre","story":"Caryl Churchill and National Theatre director bemoan ‘devastating loss’ after Israeli strikeLeading playwrights and directors in Britain have severely criticised the bombing of a major cultural centre in the Gaza Strip by Israel’s air force, calling it a “devastating loss for the already isolated community”.In a letter to the , 14 figures from UK theatre, including the director of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, and dramatist Caryl Churchill, condemned the “total destruction” of the Said al-Mishal Culture Centre.“We support our dear friends and colleagues who describe ‘their great rage and deep pain’ at the obliteration of this symbol of Palestinian culture and identity as they mourn the destruction of one of the few large venues for theatre and music performances in besieged Gaza,” the group said.“Since its establishment in 2004, Al-Mishal served as a home for hundreds of plays, ceremonies, exhibits, musical performances and national ceremonies. It was the venue of choice for theatre companies in Gaza and a space for Gaza’s top musical acts.”Most recently, the centre hosted a joint performance with artists in the UK. At Home in Gaza and London, which ran in June and July, attempted to connect people living under severe blockade with British audiences.The multi-storey building was flattened on Thursday last week during a peak in violence, as Israel launched more than 150 airstrikes in Gaza and Palestinian militants fired more than 180 rockets and mortars into southern Israel.Three Palestinians were killed that day, including a pregnant woman, a toddler and a fighter from the armed wing of Hamas, the group that runs the enclave. Several Israelis were wounded.In an apparent reference to the cultural centre bombing, the Israeli army said at the time that its jets had targeted a five-storey structure which it said was “used by the Hamas terror organisation’s interior security forces for military purposes”.It shared a photo of the building and a video of the airstrike, showing an overhead view of the explosion. “The strike is an example of the (Israeli Defense Force’s) intelligence and operational capabilities, which will intensify as necessary,” it added.The centre was seen as a cultural landmark in Gaza, holding a theatre, a library and offices for artistic associations. It was also used as a recreation centre for children affected by the three wars waged between Israel and Hamas during the past decade.

But there’s a need for mission here in Ireland now, a need for a new evangelisation.”In the four decades since the last papal visit to Ireland, that of John Paul II in 1979, the country has seen a steep decline in the numbers of people attending mass and the moral authority of the church has been shattered by revelations of child sexual abuse and mistreatment of vulnerable women in the Magdalene Laundries.Ireland was a “very different society” today, said Martin. “Actually, to be honest, it’s a much more exciting and challenging place to be a priest and a pastor than to be part of some kind of big systemic culture in Ireland in which everyone does everything because that’s what the church said they have to do. Those days are long gone.”Pope Francis has faced calls to address issues such as the legacy of sexual abuse and its cover-up, LGBT rights and the role of women in the church during his 36-hour visit to the World Meeting of Families.“Sometimes people ask me: ‘Do you think the church can draw a line under the issue?’ I really don’t think we can.“When you meet survivors of abuse, they never draw a line under it. It’s with them for the rest of their lives – the horrific betrayal of trust, the sins and the crimes of the church, our shameful efforts at avoiding scandal which in the end created more scandal … It’s a shadow that’s there all the time.”The “awful, heinous wound on the body of the church” was not just a matter for local parishes or dioceses to deal with. “This is a systemic issue for the whole church. This is not an isolated issue of a bad priest in a particular school or parish. This is an issue where the whole culture of our church wrongly facilitated abuse.“Pope Francis can offer something, speaking on behalf of the church universal, that could be extremely helpful for all of us – survivors and those of us doing our best to deal with the legacy, the awful hurt and trauma that this issue has left.”Although other institutions and organisations in society were also facing up to the legacy of abuse and cover-up, the Catholic church could provide a model of “how a worldwide institution can accept its responsibility and then become, please God, at some stage instrumental in the healing of the terrible hurts that have happened. Pope Francis is the sort of person who can lead us on that journey.”He added: “Francis, ever since he arrived on the scene, has been challenging for all of us. He’s pushed us to consider the marginalised, the disadvantaged, to reach out to migrants, the homeless, to those forgotten in the normal day-to-day discussions in the public square. A lot of what he has said has disturbed our comfort as a church.”The archbishop said there was a “clerical culture” in Ireland, in which leadership was seen to be priests or bishops. “There are a lot of women already playing central leadership roles. We have outstanding women leading up our Catholic schools, for example, but if they do not feel affirmed in their role then we are failing and I’m saddened,” he said.In response to criticism and claims of exclusion from LGBT groups, he said for the first time the World Meeting of Families will host two panel discussions on how the church can “reach out to families struggling with this issue”.“How can we be faithful members of our church and present our teaching in a truthful, yet loving and merciful, way to all our children? That for me is the challenge,” Martin said.“Many groups feel excluded, feel we are insensitive in our language and our approach. The WMF wants to be welcoming, but people must realise this is an event of the Catholic church.”Martin was disappointed that Francis would not be visiting Northern Ireland during his brief visit, but hoped the pope would address the situation there.“I think he should affirm our efforts for peace. People are still carrying the wounds and traumas of the Troubles. I would love Pope Francis’s presence to speak to these people who are suffering because of conflict, war and violence in Ireland and other parts of the world.”He expected “thousands upon thousands” of people from Northern Ireland to travel south to see the pope, and said he would continue to invite Francis to make a papal visit to the north."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.2266695.1534448515!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"and here is our weather for the last 200 years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWeather matters: A specially formed team at the Central Statistics Office, alongside Met Éireann, has been transferring the daily data to its computer system. A painstaking trawl through two centuries of daily Irish weather reports is expected to deliver new insights into how climate change might be affecting the country.Once complete, the project will open a treasure trove of information that will benefit our understanding of everything from farming practices to the pattern and prediction of major weather events.Daily handwritten records including measurements of sunshine, temperatures, wind, rainfall and humidity from Phoenix Park have been carefully preserved in old leather-bound logbooks at Met Éireann’s Dublin library.However, to date, our understanding of historic pre-1960s weather patterns has been limited to monthly summaries of these, offering a less-than-perfect picture.“Because the weather is so variable, the longer the time series you have the more you will be able to determine whether you think there is something different happening that is arising from human activity,” said Gerry Brady, the CSO senior environmental statistician leading the project.While it will not be finished until the spring, statisticians have so far been able to compile a snapshot of data between 1931 and 1959.Together with existing electronic records from 1960 on, they will begin to give the first clear picture of trends going back through the decades.Once the Phoenix Park project is finished, the CSO team will begin analysing another part of the country, eventually building a national picture.It is taking the team about six hours to input the data of each month – meaning the entire project will take about 9,360 hours to complete.Such complex material is unavailable in most countries and statisticians believe it will be of vital importance given Ireland’s geographical location on the western fringe of Europe in the Atlantic Ocean.Importantly, it will help analysts take a long view of weather before and after the growth of industry and emissions, particularly in terms of increasing motor and air travel from the 1970s.Monthly data summaries had previously been extracted for research. However, while they gave some historical understanding they clouded the specifics of what was happening throughout any given month.For example, if one April recorded a total of 40mm of rain then the average would show 1.3mm per day. However, if there had been only two days of rain with about 20mm per day then the true picture of 28 dry days would be hidden to anyone looking back. The project will expose those blind spots.In the period modelled to date, the CSO found that the only heatwave – five consecutive days of 25 degrees or over – occurred in June, 1949 when temperatures reached a high of 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28.3C). That heat wave was far more humid than the one this summer.It looked at heavy rainfall and found the wettest day of its sample period (71.3mm of rain) was on August 21st, 1955.Changing temperatures in a certain part of the country could have implications for approaches to farming – what crops are planted and when. The data can help to understand the movement of species the arrival of migrating birds and the possibility of mosquitoes.“Opportunities arise and threats arise if there are changes to the climate,” said Mr Brady. “It’s difficult to predict weather and the more data you have the more informed should be the predictions.”Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3598775.1534449802!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup and sinn f%C3%A9in accused of abdication of responsibility over brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLisa Chambers accused the DUP of willingly ensuring that Stormont institutions are kept suspended because it suits the party’s agenda at Westminster. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillMs Chambers, the party’s spokeswoman on Brexit, accused both parties of an “abdication of responsibility” in collapsing the Stormont institutions over the past 20 months. Speaking at the Parnell Summer School on the theme of ‘21st Century Democracy: Opportunities and Threats’, she said it was “remarkable” that the voices of Northern Ireland politicians were not being heard on Brexit. She pointed out that the only Northern Ireland representatives in Westminster are the DUP who are pro-Brexit, even though the majority of people in the North voted for the UK to remain in the EU. She accused the DUP of willingly ensuring that Stormont institutions are kept suspended because it suits the party’s agenda at Westminster and she said Sinn Féin was playing into its hands with its abstentionist policy. “These MPs matter all the more because since that disastrous snap election that Theresa May called where she lost her majority, their numbers are currently keeping May’s government in power,” she said. “The collapse of power-sharing in Stormont, with no imminent sign of its return, further adds to the imbalance in Northern Ireland’s democratic voice.” She accused the Government of “megaphone diplomacy” in relation to the backstop agreement that followed in the aftermath of the December agreement between the EU and the UK. There it was agreed that Northern Ireland would retain regulatory alignment with the EU if no deal could be reached between the EU and the UK. She said it created unnecessary tensions in Anglo-Irish relations and among Unionists. Speaking on the same platform at the Parnell School, former Siptu president Jack O’Connor, who will be a Labour party candidate in the forthcoming general election, said he too believed the Government had oversold the backstop arrangement agreed last December. Mr O’Connor said in his experience of 42-years as a union leader, he had learned the dangers of overselling deals. “The more you hype what you have achieved in negotiation, the more difficult it is for the people you negotiate with. The more you jeopardise the potential for the next agreement,” he explained. “This was a time for a more mature approach.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

She is a brand ambassador for the diet plan. It says a brand sponsoring an influencer to create a post without any control of the content would not have to be labelled as an advert. A number of celebrities including Rita Ora, Ellie Goulding and Cara Delevigne have previously made posts which might be in breach of the rules.Singer and actress Rita Ora, 26, who has over 13 million followers, posted a picture of herself on holiday in Jamaica captioned Rockhouse Hotel, naming accommodation in the beach resort of Negril. Another bikini shot was captioned Thank you @rockhousehotel.It is not yet known whether any of these celebrities are part of the CMA\u0027s latest investigation.The highest-paid Instagram influencers, including one star who gets £14,000 per postThe watchdog revealed it has written to a range of celebrities to gather more information about their posts and the nature of the business agreements they have in place with brands. It is also asking the public to share their experiences as part of the investigation, and said it was particularly interested in hearing from people who had bought products which were endorsed on social media. George Lusty, the CMA\u0027s senior director for consumer protection, said: Social media stars can have a big influence on what their followers do and buy.If people see clothes, cosmetics, a car, or holiday being plugged by someone they admire, they might be swayed into buying it.So, it\u0027s really important they are clearly told whether a celebrity is promoting a product because they have bought it themselves, or because they have been paid or thanked in some way by the brand.Retail and Consumer industryCelebrity Big Brother 2018: launch show - Kirstie Ally joins kidnapped model Chloe Ayling but no sign of Stormy DanielsChinese plane skids off Manila runway in downpourComment: New Zealand is turning away apocalypse-fearing billionaires...

I respect that. That\u0027s why I don\u0027t have any physical contact with men or with women.“I can live by the rules of my religion and also at the same time follow the rules of the country that I live in.”Chinese plane skids off Manila runway in downpourComment: New Zealand is turning away apocalypse-fearing billionaires...

Chinese has become more popular among sixth formers than German for the first time – with 3,334 students taking the subject\u0026nbspthis year compared to 3,058 students who sat exams in the European language\u0026nbsp.A-level Chinese – which saw a rise of 8.6 per cent in entries compared to 2017 – has bucked the\u0026nbsptrend of students moving away from modern foreign languages in sixth form. The number of students opting to study\u0026nbspGerman, French and Spanish has fallen by 7.9 per cent, new figures from exam boards show.Entry rates for German were down by 16.5 per cent on last year, while entries for French declined by 8 per cent to 8,713 and entries for Spanish dropped by 4 per cent to 8,255.Suzanne O’Farrell, curriculum and assessment specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We’re seeing German just moving into extinction really. It is in severe decline.”The move towards Chinese at A-level comes after the government launched a £10m Mandarin Excellence Programme – which is aiming for 5,000 young people to become fluent Mandarin speakers by 2020.Mandarin Chinese is the first language of over 1.25 billion people worldwide, and fluency in the language is widely considered to be useful in an increasingly global economy.Mark Herbert, director of schools and skills at the British Council, said\u0026nbspthe continued decline in pupils taking a modern language A-level in the first place was a “real concern”.“Student perceptions that languages are more difficult and less important than other subjects need to be tackled,” he said.A-level results 2018 – in picturesStudents celebrate their A Level results from Ark

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes.

And yet we are still able to see signs of their original chemistry,” he said.Their results were published in the journal Geochemical Perspectives Letters.The tiny structures the researchers examined belong to a limited club of formations touted by different groups as the oldest ever fossils.\u0026nbspEven in the wider Strelley Pool formation, which geologists think was once submerged underneath a shallow ocean, there are other ancient structures called stromatolites thought to be the remains of ancient colonies.Some proposed microfossils discovered in Canada have pushed the origin of life on Earth back even further to over 4 billion years ago.Besides confirming that\u0026nbsplife’s history stretches\u0026nbspback at least 3.4 billion years, the scientists behind the new study – which was presented at the Goldschmidt geochemistry conference in Boston – want to use their methods to investigate specimens with competing claims.“There are competing claims over which microfossils are actually the world\u0027s oldest, this analytical strategy needs to be applied to other ancient samples to help settle the controversy,” said Dr Alleon.Professor Vickie Bennett, a researcher at the Australian National University with expertise in this area who was not involved in the new study, agreed this work provided “compelling evidence” that the Strelley microfossils were evidence of life on ancient Earth.Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system.

This allowed them to estimate the formation times of these galaxies.Nasa’s Parker Solar Probe mission launches succcessfully on second attemptTheir findings agree with the current model for the development of the universe, known as the “Lambda cold dark matter model”.“A nice aspect of this work is that it highlights the complementarity between the predictions of a theoretical model and real data,” said Dr Sownak Bose of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics, who led the research.“A decade ago, the faintest galaxies in the vicinity of the Milky Way would have gone under the radar.“With the increasing sensitivity of present and future galaxy censuses, a whole new trove of the tiniest galaxies has come into the light, allowing us to test theoretical models in new regimes.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/16/11/jupiter-surface.jpg","title":"jupiter saturn extreme conditions laser space hydrogen gas deuterium solar system","story":"Created with Sketch.Hydrogen gas inside Jupiter and Saturn is subjected to pressures millions of times greater than on Earth, turning it into a metallic liquidClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe hydrogen gas inside Jupiter is subjected to pressures 6 million times higher than Earth’s atmosphereExperiments with the world’s biggest laser have given scientists fresh insights into Jupiter and Saturn, the largest planets in our solar system.Inside these giant planets, the hydrogen gas that forms a key part of their structure is subjected to pressures and temperatures 6\u0026nbspmillion times higher than Earth’s atmosphere.Under these extreme conditions, hydrogen stops behaving like a gas and instead is squeezed until it takes on the properties of a liquid metal.To understand this process, researchers made use of the National Ignition Facility in California, the largest and most advanced laser in the world.They fired powerful beams\u0026nbspat a gas sample, raising it to a pressure similar to that found on Jupiter.In doing so, they watched as hydrogen turned from an invisible gas to a transparent liquid, which then turned black as the pressure mounted even further and ultimately resembled a reflective metallic substance similar to aluminium.“Arguably we have known about the existence of this metallic state of hydrogen for roughly 100 years, and it has been measured for around 25 years,” Dr Stewart McWilliams of the University of Edinburgh told The Independent.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

Dr McWilliams said their research adds another piece to this on-going puzzle.“We are mapping the path hydrogen takes from a gas to the conditions we might see in the centre of Jupiter, and ultimately this will tell us how we reach conditions in the centre of stars – which are even more extreme than those we studied,” he explained.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/16/13/london-underground.jpg","title":"london underground guide tourist tube how to dos donts rules map","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Hell is other people,\u0027 as Jean-Paul Satre\u0026nbspobservedClick to followThe Independent OnlineCommuters queuing for Victoria line trains at Green Park Tube stationCommuting in the British capital can be a living nightmare.As we saw during the recent summer heatwave, when temperatures on the London Underground surpassed that at which it’s\u0026nbsplegal\u0026nbspto transport cattle, the Tube can be a particularly gruelling experience.Packed in and shoved up against your fellow passengers on busy rush hour trains, sweat gushing from your armpits as you stare\u0026nbspdown the barrel of another\u0026nbspfull working week in which your\u0026nbspgenius will once again go unappreciated by the philistines of middle-management, dreaming of escape to sunnier\u0026nbspclimes and a new life by the sea... Sorry, where was I?The intensity of the situation can inspire a frustration with one’s fellow humans like few others.The uncomfortable heat exacerbated by someone else\u0027s thoughtlessness, exasperating ticks\u0026nbspor selfish lack of consideration for those around them\u0026nbspcan turn even the most mild-mannered nebbish into Genghis Khan.But there’s plenty we can do to make conditions more bearable for one another. If everyone followed the handful of simple, common sense\u0026nbsprules below, commuting on the Tube might be a great deal less toxic.There are two major sources of annoyance at the barriers: the first is people arriving at the front of the queue and only then searching through their pockets or bag for their ticket, card or phone while those standing\u0026nbspbehind smoulder with rage. Folks, just pay attention and be prepared.The other is people who stop dead in their tracks immediately after passing through to consult a map or check Twitter. Do. Not. Do. This.When riding down to platform level, remember to keep moving if you’re taking the left-hand lane.As with the ticket barriers, tourists unfamiliar with the local customs can be partially excused for not knowing good form.\u0026nbspBut on the escalators, you can see clearly in front of you what the natives are doing so there’s really no excuse for not following suit.You wouldn’t stick cautiously at 30mph on the M1, would you?When your train arrives, the correct procedure is to stand aside and queue at either door to let exiting passengers off first, therein creating much-needed space.Everyone should know this – public service announcements telling you precisely what to do resound at every single station -\u0026nbspand yet there’s always\u0026nbspsomeone who takes it as an invitation to violate the implicit social contract and shoulder-barge their way through the wall of would-be departees, causing havoc.As Seinfeld’s George Costanza once screamed at a fellow traveller: “You know we’re living in a society!”Not moving down inside the carriage is probably the biggest frustration for Tube drivers, who are forced to repeat the request again and again over the tannoy at every station they approach. Come on people, what’s so bad about standing in the centre of the aisle and holding a handrail anyway? You often end up with more space.But there are plenty of other habits commonly engaged in, often utterly obliviously, by members of the public that conjure deep-rooted primal fury.Please, please avoid the following. We’re begging you.No loud music hissing from headphones. Come on mate. Not everyone likes Coldplay.No public displays of affection. Guys, please. Your love is grotesque.Don’t talk to strangers. Nobody wants to be bothered on the Tube and your chat-up lines are definitely coming across 90 per cent creepier than you imagine. You’re not John Hamm.No wheelie suitcases\u0026nbspor bulky golf bags at rush hour if you can possibly help it. This might not always be possible to avoid but be realistic.No obnoxious manspreading or taking up a second seat with the aforesaid\u0026nbspunwieldy bag.Food is just about acceptable, just,\u0026nbspso long as it doesn’t have a powerful odour or drip sauce everywhere. Every right-thinking person adores a donner\u0026nbspkebab, but\u0026nbspplease, control yourself.This is perhaps the most contentious and complex of all issues posed by the London Underground: when to give up your seat, which is unquestionably a pleasure to be savoured when it\u0027s fair to do so.Everyone fears disappearing into a spiral of shame and\u0026nbspself-loathing if they look up to see fellow travellers glaring at them for not standing to make way for an expectant mother or frail senior. Equally, they don’t want to appear patronising and inadvertently cause offence as a result of misdirected gallantry.UK news in picturesStudents react as they receive their \u0027A\u0027 level results at Stoke Newington School and Sixth Form in London.

That is why my trade union, Community, is backing\u0026nbspThe Independent’s Final Say\u0026nbspcampaign, to secure a people’s vote on the final deal.”Contribute to the march of a generationAt the last People’s Vote March in June, well over 100,000 people marched on parliament.Community’s roots are in textile manufacturing and the steel industry – pushed to the brink of collapse in recent years as much larger economies such as China distort international markets.In 2018 the industry has faced new pressure in particular from steel tariffs imposed by Donald Trump’s US administration, which Brexiteers are relying on for a favourable future trade deal.Community also supports prison and justice workers, logistics, finance, politics and public affairs staff, the charity and freelance sectors and is affiliated to the Labour\u0026nbspParty.Mr Rickhuss highlighted London School of Economics data concluding Brexit was already costing the average UK household more than £404 a year by June 2017.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline

“profoundly different to those presented in 2016”, branding the promise of £350m a week for the NHS “worthless” and the guarantee that European trade would not be harmed as “at best a mistake, and at worst a deliberate lie.”The general secretary added: “When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is\u0026nbspgood enough.When Theresa May believes she has got the best outcome she can, then she must come back and allow us to decide if her best is good enough.\u0026nbsp If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table“If that outcome is rejected, then all options should be on the table, including reopening negotiations with Europe and retaining the status quo.“Community would not shy away from asking our members to vote on important or difficult issues in the workplace our politicians must do the right thing and give the people a Final Say on their future.”The People’s Vote launched in April demanding a referendum on the deal agreed with the EU\u0026nbspand has a grassroots network of around 1 million people, holding rallies and action days across the country.The Independent launched its own Final Say campaign three weeks ago,\u0026nbspso far gathering 615,000 names to its petition along with a string of political endorsements.In June this year more than 100,000 people from all walks of life marched on parliament to demand their democratic voice be heard in a new Brexit referendum.But following the newly forged alliance, the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future, on Saturday 20 October\u0026nbspin London, is set to be much larger.Ireland is closer than ever to unification because of BrexitWhy hasn’t the NHS been prioritised in

gathering, with young people whose voices were not heard two years ago at its forefront, will constitute one of the most significant demonstrations in British history – just as Ms May returns from Brussels from a critical Brexit summit.Amatey Doku, vice-president of the 7\u0026nbspmillion-strong National Union of Students and a supporter of the For our Future’s Sake group that backs a new referendum, said: “This Tory government, unfortunately assisted by the Labour Party,\u0026nbspthreaten to harm young people’s futures.Rees-Mogg suggests a second Brexit referendum would be acceptable in clip from 2011“That’s why students across the country are coming together for the People’s Vote and The Independent March for the Future. Students and young people can no longer be ignored – and on 20 October, we won’t be.”The prime minister had once aimed to have a deal agreed with Europe earlier this summer, but with negotiations badly stalling and a major cabinet fallout, expectations turned to the October summit.British ministers privately admit it is now unlikely the UK will be able to agree a deal even by October, with a special summit potentially needed before Christmas – leaving just three months in the new year for the UK and the EU to ratify any agreement.It is also unclear if Ms May will be able to navigate any deal across her party’s deep isions, with the European Research Group of backbench Tory MPs drawing up alternative proposals highlighting the benefits of a no-deal Brexit.An exclusive poll carried out by BMG Research this week found that 48 per cent of the public would now back a vote on any deal struck between the UK and the EU – up from 44 per cent just four weeks ago.Just 24 per cent opposed the idea, down three points over the same period. Only 14 per cent of the 1,500 people surveyed supported Ms May’s chequers deal given a choice.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/11/09/06/ilhan-omar-1.jpg","title":"ilhan omar wins minnesota democratic primary victory speech watch","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,\u0027 she tells crowdClick to followThe Independent USIlhan Omar, who is likely to become the first Somali-American elected to US Congress, made history on Tuesday by winning a seat in Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District.The politician garnered national attention just two years ago after becoming the first Somali American elected to a state legislature in Minnesota - unseating a 22-term Democratic incumbent.In my last race, I talked about what my win would have meant for that eight-year-old girl in that refugee camp,” she told a crowd of supporters after her win.\u0026nbspJahana Hayes could be Connecticut\u0027s first black Democrat in CongressTransgender candidate Christine Hallquist makes history in VermontAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez supports Kaniela Ing in Hawaii primaries“And today, today, I still think about her and I think about the kind of hope and optimism all of those eight-year-olds around the country and around the world get from seeing your beautiful faces elect and believe in someone like me.“So I humbly thank you.

It is unclear whether the North Korean leader responded.When Mr Peskov was asked whether the two leaders could meet in Vlaostok, he said the economic forum is\u0026nbsp”open for all the leaders of the region” but said Moscow has “so far” received no confirmation\u0026nbspfrom Pyongyang to indicate Mr Kim\u0026nbspwill attend.Mr Kim also sent a message to Mr Putin, KCNA reported, noting the “valuable tradition” as they “struggled shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy in the arduous anti-Japanese war”, which it said provided the “strong roots” for their diplomatic relations.It was unclear if the message came before or after Mr Putin’s invitation.It comes as North Korea marked its liberation from Japanese rule\u0026nbspwith relatively low-key celebrations.A group of war veterans from the former Soviet Union participated and thousands of people cheered their football team to victory over a South Korean squad in the opening match of an under-15 youth tournament in Pyongyang, which featured players from several countries.People also streamed to statues of the country’s leaders or other monuments to observe the anniversary, as is customary.Escape from North KoreaA hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China. He was a commissioned officer in the Korean People\u0027s Army, and left in his uniform. South Korean intelligence confiscated it, but he persuaded his North Korean military contacts to send him a new one.Jeong Min-woo, 29, poses for a photograph in SeoulKang, 28, who wanted to be identified only by her surname, poses for a photograph in Seoul. The parents of Kang sent out a coat across the Chinese border after she reached the South in 2010. I didn\u0027t ask my mother to send me this coat, said Kang. But she knew I feel the cold easily and sent it to me. She sent some honey too, but it went missing on the way. The coat is made of dog fur. I don\u0027t know what kind of dog. In 2010, it cost about 700,000 North Korean won ($88 at the unofficial rate). It was really expensive. A North Korean friend went to China to pick it up for me. I liked this coat when I got it. I thought my mother must\u0027ve spent quite a lot of money on it.  The dog fur coat belonging to Kang, My father was a party officer. Our family had a car and we lived in a special apartment. Ordinary people couldn\u0027t afford to wear this kind of coat, not even soldiers. Commissioned officers could afford them. Border guards would wear them. It wasn\u0027t easy to buy this kind of coat, but as time went on, fake ones began to appear. The state often clamped down on this item. It\u0027s technically military supplies so the state monitored people who altered the design of the coat. I know just from looking at this coat that it\u0027s a counterfeit one, not the official version. The counterfeit ones look quite different from the original ones. Military officials preferred the fakes to the original because the design looked much better. The children of rich families would wear them. I look too chubby in this, so don\u0027t wear it here. I thought I could probably wear it if I altered it.Lee Oui-ryuk is from Onsong, near the border with China. He defected in 2010, and brought his ID card with him. I brought my ID with me when I left North Korea. Juche 95.11.7 (the date in the North Korean calendar, which equates to Nov. 7, 2006) is the date I was issued with my ID. It says here my blood type is A, but I\u0027m actually an O. For the 23 years I lived in North Korea, I thought my blood type was A. They wrote down my blood type without even doing a test. They just wrote whatever they wanted to. I was caught trying to defect to South Korea around Kim Jong Il\u0027s birthday. They strengthen border security just before and after that date.The bottom of the lamp is dark, as the saying goes, and I thought I\u0027d be able to cross right under their noses. The soldiers shot at me as I tried to run away from the Tumen River. I managed to get away and hid, but someone reported me and I was caught. That\u0027s when I was taken to the bowibu (North Korean secret police) for three months of interrogation. The state ruled that I had tried to defect to South Korea, and I was sent to a camp for political prisoners. I escaped when they were transferring me to the camp. I hid and managed to make it to my big sister\u0027s house - that\u0027s when I grabbed these photos. I couldn\u0027t go home easily, so decided I had to hide in the mountains or somewhere remote. I needed my ID to move around without getting caught. and I took these 12 photos with me in case I wanted to look back and reminisce. I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why. She said that after I had left, she moved in with her father in Pyongyang and had been cooking for him. She said she decided to become a chef so she could fulfill my role at home. I was sad when I heard that.Lee Min-bok, 60, was a researcher at North Korea\u0027s Academy of Agricultural Science. He first tried to defect, unsuccessfully, in 1990. He eventually left North Korea in June 1991 and came to South Korea in 1995. His family sent him these diaries. I have a bit of an academic side. According to Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, people are supposed to keep diaries. Everyone in North Korea should strictly follow Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, so I did as I was supposed to and kept a diary. Even though Kim Il Sung is a villain here, in North Korea he\u0027s above everything. We learned that he studied well and gave our lives purpose. I lived according to those teachings. I wrote these out of loyalty to the Leader. That was our ideology, and I lived my life in strict adherence to it. No one could think differently.I got hold of these diaries 10 years after I arrived in South Korea. I had been sending money to my family in the North and they sent them to me. I didn\u0027t write any complaints in diaries. I would\u0027ve been in big trouble if I did. My diaries are a record of my history in North Korea. I am thinking about turning these diaries into a book. I\u0027d like to publish a book about how to change North Koreans\u0027 thinking when unification happens. These diaries show how North Koreans think and how their minds are constructed. People need to make these into a textbook, because they need proof. Talking is not as effective.Song Byeok was a propaganda artist. His father drowned trying to cross the Tumen river, in 2000. When the artist finally left North Korea in 2001, he brought photos of his family with him. We left that August to find food, Byeok recalled, describing the first attempt. We were from a town further inland, and we weren\u0027t sure where the river was high and where it was low. I didn\u0027t know at the time but the river was swollen because of the rainy season. I thought we had to cross it anyway. All I could think about was getting to China to buy food. I took off my clothes and tied them into a rope to strap us together. I told my father not to let go. As we approached the middle of the river, the strap felt lighter. I looked back and saw my father drifting away. I was devastated.He was going under the water and couldn\u0027t get out. I rushed up to the (North Korean) border guards and asked them to save him but they just said why did I come out, why didn\u0027t I die too. They handcuffed me and took me away. It was Aug. 28. I was tortured by the bowibu (North Korean secret police) in Hoeryong, then jailed for four months in Chongjin prison camp. But after I was released from the camp I felt like I needed to survive and carry on living. Right before I tried to defect again, I went back home and grabbed my family photos. Even if I died trying, I thought, at least I would have this picture with me. I never found my father. After I came to South Korea, I went back to China in 2004 and held a memorial service for him by the river. My heart still aches.Baek Hwa-sung, 33, left Sinuiju, on the border with China, in 2003 and resettled in South Korea in 2008. He kept a diary as he defected. In 2004, I started to write down all my thoughts in a diary. I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get caught. I just wanted to let it be known where I was from, and where I wanted to go. After I left the North, I became very depressed, hiding in the mountains alone for a while. The people who were watching over me told me not to come down to the village and left me by myself in a mountain shelter. Alone, with no one to engage with or talk to, I felt like I would go insane. So I wanted to leave something behind in case I died there or got caught - that\u0027s why I started to write.Alone in the mountains, I desperately sought something to talk to. That was my diary. My diaries are proof of my life\u0027s journey. I read them when I want to remember home. I can\u0027t return home, and I already have no memories of my hometown. But when I go through my diaries, there are notes which detail the vivid memories of that time. Sometimes I might forget my father\u0027s birthday, but when I go back to my diary, his birthday and my mother\u0027s birthday are there. My diaries are a record of my life. They prove I\u0027m alive.A hat belonging to Jeong Min-woo in Seoul. Min-woo is from Hyesan, on the border with China. He was a commissioned officer in the Korean People\u0027s Army, and left in his uniform. South Korean intelligence confiscated it, but he persuaded his North Korean military contacts to send him a new one.Jeong Min-woo, 29, poses for a photograph in SeoulKang, 28, who wanted to be identified only by her surname, poses for a photograph in Seoul. The parents of Kang sent out a coat across the Chinese border after she reached the South in 2010. I didn\u0027t ask my mother to send me this coat, said Kang. But she knew I feel the cold easily and sent it to me. She sent some honey too, but it went missing on the way. The coat is made of dog fur. I don\u0027t know what kind of dog. In 2010, it cost about 700,000 North Korean won ($88 at the unofficial rate). It was really expensive. A North Korean friend went to China to pick it up for me. I liked this coat when I got it. I thought my mother must\u0027ve spent quite a lot of money on it.  The dog fur coat belonging to Kang, My father was a party officer. Our family had a car and we lived in a special apartment. Ordinary people couldn\u0027t afford to wear this kind of coat, not even soldiers. Commissioned officers could afford them. Border guards would wear them. It wasn\u0027t easy to buy this kind of coat, but as time went on, fake ones began to appear. The state often clamped down on this item. It\u0027s technically military supplies so the state monitored people who altered the design of the coat. I know just from looking at this coat that it\u0027s a counterfeit one, not the official version. The counterfeit ones look quite different from the original ones. Military officials preferred the fakes to the original because the design looked much better. The children of rich families would wear them. I look too chubby in this, so don\u0027t wear it here. I thought I could probably wear it if I altered it.Lee Oui-ryuk is from Onsong, near the border with China. He defected in 2010, and brought his ID card with him. I brought my ID with me when I left North Korea. Juche 95.11.7 (the date in the North Korean calendar, which equates to Nov. 7, 2006) is the date I was issued with my ID. It says here my blood type is A, but I\u0027m actually an O. For the 23 years I lived in North Korea, I thought my blood type was A. They wrote down my blood type without even doing a test. They just wrote whatever they wanted to. I was caught trying to defect to South Korea around Kim Jong Il\u0027s birthday. They strengthen border security just before and after that date.The bottom of the lamp is dark, as the saying goes, and I thought I\u0027d be able to cross right under their noses. The soldiers shot at me as I tried to run away from the Tumen River. I managed to get away and hid, but someone reported me and I was caught. That\u0027s when I was taken to the bowibu (North Korean secret police) for three months of interrogation. The state ruled that I had tried to defect to South Korea, and I was sent to a camp for political prisoners. I escaped when they were transferring me to the camp. I hid and managed to make it to my big sister\u0027s house - that\u0027s when I grabbed these photos. I couldn\u0027t go home easily, so decided I had to hide in the mountains or somewhere remote. I needed my ID to move around without getting caught. and I took these 12 photos with me in case I wanted to look back and reminisce. I wrote on the back of them so as not to forget.Ji Sung-ho, 35, from Hoeryong, near the border with China. He left North Korea in 2006 with a pair of wooden crutches. I lived as a child beggar in North Korea. I was stealing coals from a train when I fell off and lost my leg and my hand. I had to bring the crutches with me. If I didn\u0027t have them, I wouldn\u0027t have made it here. The state doesn\u0027t help you in North Korea, and people who need crutches make their own. Mine are therefore not factory-made, so they\u0027re not perfect and break easily. I had several pairs of crutches but they all broke, and this was the last pair. I used these crutches for 10 years, until I was 25, when I arrived in South Korea. I would steal coal from moving trains and fall off, destroying my crutches. Or I would get beaten up by the police and they\u0027d take and then break my crutches. When they broke, I would make new ones. When I had new ones, I could go back outside.When I first arrived in South Korea I thought about throwing them out. South Korea\u0027s intelligence agency gave me a prosthetic leg. My friends said I should throw the crutches out and not think about North Korea. They said I should show Kim Jong Il I was living a new life in South Korea and throw out everything I had from the North. Some asked if I got upset when I saw my crutches. But I couldn\u0027t just throw them out. To make my crutches, my friends had given me some wood that they had bought, and someone I knew in North Korea who had carpentry skills had made them. It was my father who added the final touches. There is a lot of love from my North Korean friends and family in these crutches. So I didn\u0027t throw them out. The South Korean government gave me some new crutches because the wood from my North Korean ones is hard and painful. But I still keep them, so as not to forget those memories. Kim Ryen Hui, 48, is from Pyongyang. She says she never wanted to defect. In 2011, she says, a broker helped her go to China for treatment on her liver. But the broker tricked her, she said, and she ended up in South Korea. She is campaigning to return, which Seoul says would be against the law. I miss my parents even more than I miss my daughter. They\u0027re everything to me. For the first few years, I couldn\u0027t even breathe properly when I thought of them. My little brother lives with them in Pyongyang now. My mother can\u0027t see out of one eye. The thing I fear the most is finding out they\u0027ve passed away before I have the chance to go back. My daughter and I have been writing letters and sending photos to each other. My cousin lives in China, so she\u0027s been sending them on. My daughter\u0027s name is Ri Ryon Gum. She was born on February 15, 1993. I don\u0027t want her to live out her life with me here. When she was young, she did taekwondo. She wanted to get involved in espionage operations against South Korea. She was so fearless. That\u0027s why she was doing taekwondo - to get involved in anti-South espionage. So I was really surprised to hear she became a chef. In a video of her I received, she explained why. She said that after I had left, she moved in with her father in Pyongyang and had been cooking for him. She said she decided to become a chef so she could fulfill my role at home. I was sad when I heard that.Lee Min-bok, 60, was a researcher at North Korea\u0027s Academy of Agricultural Science. He first tried to defect, unsuccessfully, in 1990. He eventually left North Korea in June 1991 and came to South Korea in 1995. His family sent him these diaries. I have a bit of an academic side. According to Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, people are supposed to keep diaries. Everyone in North Korea should strictly follow Kim Il Sung\u0027s teachings, so I did as I was supposed to and kept a diary. Even though Kim Il Sung is a villain here, in North Korea he\u0027s above everything. We learned that he studied well and gave our lives purpose. I lived according to those teachings. I wrote these out of loyalty to the Leader. That was our ideology, and I lived my life in strict adherence to it. No one could think differently.I got hold of these diaries 10 years after I arrived in South Korea. I had been sending money to my family in the North and they sent them to me. I didn\u0027t write any complaints in diaries. I would\u0027ve been in big trouble if I did. My diaries are a record of my history in North Korea. I am thinking about turning these diaries into a book. I\u0027d like to publish a book about how to change North Koreans\u0027 thinking when unification happens. These diaries show how North Koreans think and how their minds are constructed. People need to make these into a textbook, because they need proof. Talking is not as effective.Song Byeok was a propaganda artist. His father drowned trying to cross the Tumen river, in 2000. When the artist finally left North Korea in 2001, he brought photos of his family with him. We left that August to find food, Byeok recalled, describing the first attempt. We were from a town further inland, and we weren\u0027t sure where the river was high and where it was low. I didn\u0027t know at the time but the river was swollen because of the rainy season. I thought we had to cross it anyway. All I could think about was getting to China to buy food. I took off my clothes and tied them into a rope to strap us together. I told my father not to let go. As we approached the middle of the river, the strap felt lighter. I looked back and saw my father drifting away. I was devastated.He was going under the water and couldn\u0027t get out. I rushed up to the (North Korean) border guards and asked them to save him but they just said why did I come out, why didn\u0027t I die too. They handcuffed me and took me away. It was Aug. 28. I was tortured by the bowibu (North Korean secret police) in Hoeryong, then jailed for four months in Chongjin prison camp. But after I was released from the camp I felt like I needed to survive and carry on living. Right before I tried to defect again, I went back home and grabbed my family photos. Even if I died trying, I thought, at least I would have this picture with me. I never found my father. After I came to South Korea, I went back to China in 2004 and held a memorial service for him by the river. My heart still aches.Baek Hwa-sung, 33, left Sinuiju, on the border with China, in 2003 and resettled in South Korea in 2008. He kept a diary as he defected. In 2004, I started to write down all my thoughts in a diary. I didn\u0027t know if I\u0027d get caught. I just wanted to let it be known where I was from, and where I wanted to go. After I left the North, I became very depressed, hiding in the mountains alone for a while. The people who were watching over me told me not to come down to the village and left me by myself in a mountain shelter. Alone, with no one to engage with or talk to, I felt like I would go insane. So I wanted to leave something behind in case I died there or got caught - that\u0027s why I started to write.Alone in the mountains, I desperately sought something to talk to. That was my diary.

But when I go through my diaries, there are notes which detail the vivid memories of that time.

For many women and their partners, a miscarriage means the loss of a baby and the hopes and the dreams for that child,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“It would give people the time out you need when you have been bereaved. It acknowledges a miscarriage is a significant event and this is even true for people who don’t take the leave.”She said the discussion the proposed bill had provoked\u0026nbspwas helping to reduce the taboo which surrounds miscarriages.\u0026nbspSome other countries have provisions for paid leave if a woman miscarries. Indian law instructs that women are eligible to six weeks’ leave if they miscarry a baby. However, the overwhelming majority of employees in the country carry out informal work so not many are entitled to it.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/17/00/italy-earthquake.jpg","title":"italy earthquake latest today magnitude molise montecilfone richter scale","story":"Created with Sketch.A boy was slightly hurt after leaping off a balcony in fear, but no injuries are blamed directly on the quakesClick to followThe Independent OnlineEmergency service personnel arrive in Montecilfone after a 5.1-magnitude earthquake struck the regionAt least nine earthquakes have rocked southern Italy in two hours, prompting frightened residents to sleep outdoors.Italy\u0027s national seismology agency INGV says the strongest quake measured 5.1 and struck at 8:19 p.m. Thursday.

Everything you need to knowThe Hajj, the five-day annual pilgrimage\u0026nbspundertaken by Muslims to the holy city of Mecca, will take place this weekend.The journey to Saudi Arabia results in the world\u0027s largest single gathering of people and is this year scheduled to begin on the evening of Sunday 19 August and ends on Friday 24 August.Here\u0027s everything you need to know.One of the Five Pillars of Islam, the Hajj is a sacred duty every Muslim must undertake at least once in their lifetime (unless they are prevented from doing so by ill health or financial hardship).The Quran\u0026nbsptraces its origins to the story of Abraham, ordered by Allah to leave his wife Hajara and infant son Ishmael in the desert of ancient Mecca as an act of faith. Hajara searched frantically for water, passing between the hills of Safa and Marwah\u0026nbspseven times, but found none, only for a fresh spring to burst from the ground beneath the child\u0027s foot.Abraham constructed the Kaaba on the spot, the black stone cuboid at the the centre of what became the Great Mosque, around which worshippers walk counter-clockwise seven times in solemn contemplation of their faith as part of the Tawaf.The Prophet Muhammad later marched from Medina to Mecca, his own birthplace,\u0026nbspto rid the Kaaba\u0026nbspof pagan idols in 632, reconsecrating it in honour of Allah.The pilgrimage in homage to the miracle and its legend today serves to unite Muslims and remind all followers of Islam that they are\u0026nbspequal in the eyes of god.As such, pilgrims strip themselves of the material trappings of wealth and status and wear the plain white seamless robes of Ihram\u0026nbspto indicate their spiritual state.In addition to circling the Kaaba, pilgrims say two Rakaat prayers at the Place of Abraham, re-enact Hajarah\u0027s hunt for water between\u0026nbspSafa\u0026nbspand Marwah, drink from the Zamzam\u0026nbspWell, stand vigil at Mount Arafat and on the plains of Muzdalifa\u0026nbspand cast stones at three pillars, a symbolic act\u0026nbsprepresenting evil being driven from the hearts of men.The Hajj takes place between the eighth and\u0026nbsp13th\u0026nbspday of\u0026nbspDhu\u0026nbspal-Hijjah, the date of which alters every year by the Gregorian calendar because the Islamic lunar calendar is 11 days shorter.Eid\u0026nbspal-Adha\u0026nbspalso falls on the\u0026nbsp10th\u0026nbspday of the month. This is a Festival of Sacrifice in honour of Abraham\u0027s willingness to sacrifice Ishmael at Allah\u0027s request, a supreme act of faith, which he was prevented from having to carry out by the deity providing him with a goat to slaughter in his son\u0027s stead.Today, the same animal is sacrificed in memory of the story. It is cut into thirds: one portion is given to the impoverished, another to friends and relatives and the last retained\u0026nbspand eaten by the family.Is the Hajj safe?Two million pilgrims are expected to take part this year, thousands of whom are embarking from the UK.While the occasion is a holy one, overcrowding led to a fatal stampede in 2015\u0026nbspwhich killed over 2,000 pilgrims and Hajj fraudsters attempting to con visitors remain a real problem.“Some will arrive in Saudi Arabia to discover the accommodation they booked does not exist while others will find that their whole trip is in fact a scam set up by illegitimate travel operators that have disappeared with thousands of pounds of their money,”\u0026nbspthe politan Police have warned.Advice on staying safe includes making sure\u0026nbspyou travel with a reputable tour operator who is ATOL-protected and part of a recognised trade association such as ABTA. All members of the latter have to follow a code of conduct, reducing the risk of fraud.\u0026nbspEnsure you have all of your terms and conditions in writing and make sure your flight details, accommodation and Hajj visa are all valid, experts advise.\u0026nbspA Muslim pilgrim partakes in the symbolic stoning of the devil at the Jamarat Bridge in Mina, near Mecca, which marks the final major rite of the hajj Muslim pilgrims take part in the symbolic stoning of the devil at the Jamarat Bridge in Mina, near Mecca, which marks the final major rite of the hajj A Muslim pilgrim partakes in the symbolic stoning of the devil at the Jamarat Bridge in MinaA Muslim pilgrim has his head shaven after throwing pebbles at pillars during the symbolic stoning of the devilA Muslim pilgrim\u0027s head is shaved, after throwing pebbles at pillars during the symbolic stoning of the devilA Saudi policeman spays Muslim pilgrims with water to cool them off near the Grand MosqueMuslim pilgrims pray at Mount Arafat, southeast of the Saudi holy city of MeccaMuslim pilgrims at the Grand MosqueIranian Muslim pilgrims wait at Jeddah airport in Saudi Arabia prior to the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the holy city of MeccaMuslim worshippers perform prayers around the Kaaba, Islam\u0027s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia\u0027s holy city of MeccaAn Iranian Muslim pilgrim reads the Koran as she waits at Jeddah airport in Saudi Arabia, prior to the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the holy city of MeccaSaudi Red Crescent paramedics show the press their emergency equipmentMuslim worshippers perform prayers around the Kaaba, Islam\u0027s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia\u0027s holy city of MeccaMuslim worshippers perform prayers around the Kaaba, Islam\u0027s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia\u0027s holy city of Mecca Muslim worshippers walk around the Kaaba, Islam\u0027s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia\u0027s holy city of MeccaMuslim pilgrims sit around the Kaaba, the cubic building at the Grand Mosque, ahead of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the Muslim holy city of MeccaA Muslim pilgrim partakes in the symbolic stoning of the devil at the Jamarat Bridge in Mina, near Mecca, which marks the final major rite of the hajj Muslim pilgrims take part in the symbolic stoning of the devil at the Jamarat Bridge in Mina, near Mecca, which marks the final major rite of the hajj A Muslim pilgrim partakes in the symbolic stoning of the devil at the Jamarat Bridge in MinaA Muslim pilgrim has his head shaven after throwing pebbles at pillars during the symbolic stoning of the devilA Muslim pilgrim\u0027s head is shaved, after throwing pebbles at pillars during the symbolic stoning of the devilA Saudi policeman spays Muslim pilgrims with water to cool them off near the Grand MosqueMuslim pilgrims pray at Mount Arafat, southeast of the Saudi holy city of MeccaMuslim pilgrims at the Grand MosqueIranian Muslim pilgrims wait at Jeddah airport in Saudi Arabia prior to the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the holy city of MeccaMuslim worshippers perform prayers around the Kaaba, Islam\u0027s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia\u0027s holy city of MeccaAn Iranian Muslim pilgrim reads the Koran as she waits at Jeddah airport in Saudi Arabia, prior to the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the holy city of MeccaSaudi Red Crescent paramedics show the press their emergency equipmentMuslim worshippers perform prayers around the Kaaba, Islam\u0027s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia\u0027s holy city of MeccaMuslim worshippers perform prayers around the Kaaba, Islam\u0027s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia\u0027s holy city of Mecca Muslim worshippers walk around the Kaaba, Islam\u0027s holiest shrine, at the Grand Mosque in Saudi Arabia\u0027s holy city of MeccaMuslim pilgrims sit around the Kaaba, the cubic building at the Grand Mosque, ahead of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the Muslim holy city of MeccaYou should make sure your travel insurance covers all aspects of the journey and that the appropriate vaccinations have been taken.

It means young people are missing out on essential skills as they approach adulthood.GRANT ROLLINGS asked five Sun columnists what their first part-time jobs were and the valuable lessons they learned – from being polite to skiving.I ALWAYS had a summer job, usually it meant working full-time hours on my normal Saturday job as holiday cover. This was either in a boutique such as Chelsea Girl or in BHS, where I worked on the sweetie counter.I coped with the boredom by sneakily munching on the best chocolate sweets from the pick-and-mix. I also worked as a waitress in a trendy Glasgow eaterie during the holidays.All of these jobs gave me the most enormous respect for the men and women who toil for long hours, often dealing with unreasonable members of the public for too little pay and not much prospect of promotion.Working in the service industry taught me the power of a disarming smile, and proved that my old granny’s saying that “you get more in life from sugar than vinegar” could not be more true.Grumpy customers demanding refunds and diners moaning that they had been waiting too long for their main course were usually placated with a swift apology and a promise to sort things out.A major restaurant blunder could often be smoothed over with a free coffee or pudding.MY favourite summer job came in 1977. I was a traffic enumerator for Middlesbrough Council. That meant I spent all day counting cars. All the way up one side of Linthorpe Road, all the way back down the other.I had to write down all the number plates. In the end, I got a bit bored and spent the time hanging out at my mate’s T-shirt shop or Fearnley Records and made the numbers up, always remembering to have them end in the local codes of HN or (I think) XG. I hope the council thought it worthwhile.It was better than the glue factory, where I’d been very briefly working on a weighbridge. Foreman pressed a button and this vast door opened and thousands of rotting animal carcasses fell out. I can still smell it now, all these years later. I passed out — soft lad, you see.Or there was working the nightshift pricing cans of food and stuff in Hintons, the local convenience store. Every time I turned up, the manager would say, ‘Here he is, the poor man’s Rod Stewart’.A friend of mine, Mark, had a much better summer job.He was a Club 18-30 holiday rep. He shagged 21 girls in 25 days, which gave me my first story to sell to the national newspapers.MY first holiday job was in the summer of 1985 when I was 16 years old. I had already been turned down from working at Waitrose in Enfield Town on the basis I was “too glamorous”.That just goes to show how far we have come in such a short time. I have never set foot in a Waitrose since that day because I was beyond furious. Anyway, the job I did get was working in a hairdresser’s on Goodge Street in London.My journey involved three changes and about 14 stops every day. The job was meant to be answering the phone, sweeping up and generally helping out, but before the end of the first week I was running the till, the appointment system, cashing up and generally managing the place.The only thing I could not do was cut hair, but that didn’t stop me cutting my friends’ hair — with very mixed results, more bad than good — on the basis I worked in a hairdresser’s so they thought I should. I remember the liberating feeling of earning my own money, it gave me the greatest sense of independence, self-esteem and self-belief.I worked out I was actually good in a work environment, talking to people — for example, talking women into perms they didn’t want — being responsible, handling money and making a difference to my employer.The biggest transition we make in our lives is leaving education to go into the workplace, and summer jobs prepare you for this.I HAD dozens of summer jobs, from working as a scaffolder’s mate with a convicted murderer, who kept a pistol in the glove compartment of his Ford Escort, to donning a white suit and Geiger counter to carry out maintenance on the core of the main reactor at a nuclear power station.I learned a hundred things from each and every job, but it was working as a grocery assistant at my local supermarket that had the most impact.My best friend and I both got jobs there at the same time. He was a star performer at school, a brilliant academic, but he couldn’t take the pace and got fired after a couple of months.It was incredibly hard, repetitive work.The manager was an ex-Army major — very strict on haircuts, discipline and stealing.There was always the prospect of the Tannoy announcement “customer service one hundred”, which was code for a shoplifter having been spotted.All the male floor staff were required to assemble at till number one to tackle the suspect, who would sometimes become violent.I was much happier making the cheese look pretty and eventually became the ruler of the entire soft dairy aisle — a project I’m still working on.I WAS 13 in Brownes Wine bar, Stafford Street, Derby, summer 1987, some years before it burned down in mysterious circumstances (has a bar ever burnt down innocently?). I was chief bottler-up.This involved the soul-sapping exercise of sifting through bins taller than me for all the recyclable bottles from the previous night’s festivities and putting them in their correct crates. This took all morning and you ended up cut to shreds and stinking of Britvic and Schlitz.I was then asked to be the cook — this involved microwaving lasagne for drunk people. I was paid the princely sum of £3 per hour. I realised how crap this was, so one scorching Saturday I nicked the shampoo that came with my dad’s company car and took advantage of the sketchy Eighties attitude to drink-driving and washed all the customers’ cars in the car park for a fiver a pop.I literally cleaned up. It was the greatest Dragons’ Den moment I’ve ever had. I waxed on and off all day, rinsing my dad of his prized BMW product. He arrived to pick me up and I was minted. A 13-year-old with £64 in his pocket. That coveted Swatch would finally be mine.He then told me the dog had been run over, so that’s another memory ruined.Thanks for reminding me.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To say that he was “present but not involved” is an insult to voters’ intelligence when photographs show him holding a wreath and gurning for a nearby camera.To allow his press office to say the widows of those murdered in Munich were being “misled” is, even among the many shameful episodes we’ve seen since he became Labour leader three hate-filled years ago, disgraceful.The most vital qualification for power in this country must be integrity. And Jeremy Corbyn has demonstrated this week that he has absolutely none of it.But for all of the shame that he brings upon Labour, it is nothing compared to the spinelessness of the party’s “moderate” MPs whose opposition to Corbyn extends not much further than wishy-washy tweets.“Present but not involved” isn’t an excuse for Corbyn but nor is it for the cowards on Labour’s backbenches.Corbyn cannot be allowed near government. But the rest of the party has lost the public’s faith too.TOMORROW, official figures are likely to suggest that train fares will go up by another 3.5 per cent in January.If you’re a commuter who has put up with delayed and cancelled trains, you’ll be wondering what you’re paying for.After a disastrous year, there is no other industry that would turn round and ask customers for even more.The failure of the Government to take responsibility, blaming unions or claiming the cash is for “investment”, is simply not good enough. It’s the same as last year’s excuse.It is time for a radical overhaul — but that does not mean nationalisation. Far from it. Our railways need MORE private sector involvement.The hybrid system we have, in which private operators rely on publicly owned tracks and have their fares regulated by government, has led us into the worst of both worlds.Transport supremo Chris Grayling needs to take on the unions once and for all. And he needs to introduce real competition on the railways, giving operators far more freedom.Commuters deserve better than finger-pointing and higher fares.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He says he was told that he couldn’t speak at the wedding and that Harry berated him on the phone for mishandling the Press while he was recovering from a heart attack.The official royal response to these outbursts has been, effectively, to shove their fingers in their ears and shout la-la-la (or lah-lah-lah).The snobby courtiers and hangers-on dismiss Markle père as fame-hungry.That’s not altogether wrong — he is clearly desperate, as he proved by posing for snaps with the paparazzi in the run-up to the wedding.But it’s not good enough to wish he’d just go away.Meghan is now one of the most photographed and sought-after women in the world. Her very well-paid PR flunkies should have seen these familial landmines a mile off and defused them.But they have failed.Thomas Markle is a difficult and proud man, no doubt. But that is why he should have been treated with care, not frozen out.Why did Team Windsor not find him a role and approach him long before the wedding to make sure he didn’t feel excluded.It’s hard not to feel for him.His ex, Meghan’s mother Doria, was hailed as one of the stars of the wedding.Because she’s a black woman, she invited lots of gushing commentary about the monarchy becoming more diverse and modern.Amen to that. But poor old podgy Thomas, an awkward-looking white bloke, has been shunned from his daughter’s nuptials. You can’t blame him for speaking out.The royal courtiers enjoy the adulation the monarchy receives because Prince Harry has been “brave” enough to marry a woman with a complicated background.But the Palace spin machine freaks out when it comes to confronting the reality of Meghan’s parentage.Perhaps they just find it too vulgar.Harry’s PR man is Jason Knauf, an American specialist in “crisis management” having worked for Royal Bank of Scotland. He excels at sending angry letters to journalists he feels have gone too far snooping into Harry and Meghan’s private lives.But he doesn’t seem to have a clue as to how to handle his clients’ grumpy relatives.As a result, the monarchy is facing arguably its worst crisis since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.We are often told how brilliant the Royal Family’s PR is. Part of the new royal spin, in fact, is about how great the royals now are at spin. They have “rebranded” the monarchy for the 21st century, and so on.Look at the blizzard of positive guff accompanying Prince William, Kate, and Harry’s campaign for mental illness last year.They were, it was said, making the younger Windsors seem more touchy-feely.At the moment, however, they don’t seem sensitive enough to speak to Meghan’s suffering in-laws.That’s not what you’d call a good look.The truth is, royal press officers have long got too much credit.The British admire the Queen because she is admirable.Overall, we prefer monarchy to any other system of government. That’s just common sense. It’s nothing to do with any ingenious branding and media strategy.The public also feels that the younger royals deserve a chance.At a time when our country is consumed by Brexit and political arguments, the wedding of Harry and Meghan came as a blessed relief — something we could all celebrate.The couple both came from broken homes, and nobody cared so long as they were happy. That’s all great.   But it’s obvious that Meghan has, as one royal expert put it, “background baggage that needs unpacking”.Insiders now say the treatment of the Markle family has been a “shambles”.This is before we consider the potential PR bombshells that could erupt if and when Meghan’s ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, decides to grant some interviews.The British don’t want to see the monarchy turned into a reality TV soap, as the Markles and Windsors wage a media war with each other.It’s trashy and embarrassing.But unless the Palace can tackle Meghan’s disgruntled kin, that’s exactly what is happening.Maybe we need a changing of the royal PR guard — before it’s too late.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yesterdays employment figures revealed that the proportion of young people unemployed (and not in full-time education) is now at a record low of 4.7% for our country - and far lower than for many other developed countries.It sends a significant message out about the drive and innovation of our young people, and the opportunities that our economy offers to them and their future.With our welfare changes this country can now be powered forward by this young generation.Since 2010, youth unemployment has fallen by over 45%, giving 130,000 more young people a job, and a future.Add the fact that wages are on the up and there are more than 829,000 vacancies nationwide, it’s clear that young people are entering the best jobs market in a decade.On average, the number of vacancies has increased by 4,280 each month over the last year, and those vacancies span from construction to technology.So when young people this week are deciding on their next steps, they can think big as there are plenty of opportunities out there for them, from a job with career progression, to taking up an apprenticeship.Look at Daisy, who turned down five university offers to work at global engineering firm JCB designing new equipment, and she didn’t have to go to university to get there.I’m forever being told, and intrinsically understand, that people want to study at different times in their lives, often inspired to do so when they see the practical benefits of their studies.That’s why so many people prefer, and do better, getting a job first and then studying for exams while they work.Even over the last few decades, how the world of education and work are linked has shifted dramatically. People no longer have one job for life, and lifelong learning is becoming more and more commonplace as people dip in and out of education.Many more people up-skill and retrain throughout their career – and this is how the future jobs market will remain vibrant and strong.And when I speak to employers up and down the country, from manufacturers to marketers, what they want are young people with the right attitude, prepared to work and learn. As they say, ‘if you’ve the will, we can give you the skill’.So when young people this week are deciding their next steps, the academic route isn’t the only option.You can now become a solicitor, an accountant or even a nuclear engineer through the apprenticeship route, earning as you learn and without the cost of going to University. Studying a Higher Apprenticeship gives an average wage boost of £150,000 over a working life.When I speak to young people around the country, I’m impressed with the confidence and self-assuredness with which they look to the future, and the range of options they consider beyond traditional routes.Im certainly no job snob. Life teaches you its not where you come from, its where you get to, and work is exactly the same.You can start anywhere and get to the top as Im repeatedly being told by our countrys top entrepreneurs.Top performers in their fields such as Debbie Moore, Jean-Christophe Novelli, Deborah Meaden and Jo Malone, did not go to university and are just a handful of the individuals who show that with drive and determination you can succeed by treading your own path.Its all about getting a break and taking the opportunities that come your way.So best of luck to everyone today, but whatever your results, there are many opportunities and pathways into a successful career.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s like trying to put up shelves using sellotape.And that matters because Italy’s various mafias – Cosa Nostra (our thing) in Sicily, the ‘Ndrangheta in Calabria and the Camorra in Naples – are all experts at winning building contracts.And their hold doesn’t stop there.Match-fixing and ticket sales in football, waste disposal agreements as well as drug and people smuggling have all been lucrative streams of income for the underworld gangs.The system has been the same for decades: politicians receive votes and kickbacks from criminal gangs who are awarded the contracts from huge construction projects.Many people who have interfered in rigged tender processes, like Vincenzo Passiarello in 1998, have been killed.Long gone are the Hollywood stereotypes of a thug with a tommy gun and a trilby. Nowadays most mafiosi wear suits and are indistinguishable from ordinary businessmen.The only difference is the size of their empires.The scale of the corruption is so great that 281 town or city councils have been dissolved by Italian authorities since 1991 because of Mafia infiltration.Often that infiltration only emerges after years of painstaking surveillance by the the Italian police.Construction appeals to the Mafia because the huge sums involved enable the laundering of dirty drugs money.The many sub-contracts mean that a criminal gang can find itself hugely empowered, responsible for the hiring and firing of thousands of workers at a time when youth unemployment in Italy bounces around 30 per cent.Costs are kept low not just through the use of poor building materials but also through strong-arm management: unions are invariably excluded from work sites, and safety inspectors intimidated or bought off.It takes a brave man or woman to point out the Mafia’s shoddy workmanship.There are, experts say, many more councils where criminal infiltration still hasn’t been discovered.One of the main advantages of infiltrating the construction industry is that it enables the Mafia to disguise itself as a legitimate, respectable business. Since the mid-1990s – when the Mafia planted bombs on the Italian mainland and blew up Sicilian investigators – it has deliberately pursued a strategy of invisibility.As one of Italy’s anti-Mafia priests said recently: “the Mafia is very able to camouflage itself, to infiltrate into legal spaces.”In 2010, anti-Mafia investigators confiscated €1.5billion (around £1.35 billion) from Cosa Nostra’s current “don of dons”, the fugitive Matteo Messina Denaro. Much of that figure was linked to construction firms.Although it’s often the cause of disasters, the Mafia is also the beneficiary of them.Each time a devastating earthquake hits the country, criminal gangs move in on the reconstruction efforts.Franco Roberti, for four years head of Italy’s anti-Mafia directorate, told La Repubblica newspaper this week: “The risk of infiltration is always high. Post-earthquake reconstruction is a tasty morsel for criminal organisations and business interests.”The worry now is that hundreds of structures throughout Italy could be at risk.Legambiente, an anti-Mafia pressure group, has warned that weakened cement has been used at Trapani and Palermo airports in Sicily, as well as in schools, car parks, bridges and motorways throughout the peninsula.Back in 2009, in a situation eerily similar to this week’s bridge collapse, 37 people lost their lives during flash floods in the Sicilian city of Messina. Buildings simply collapsed in the rain because inadequate cement had been used in the construction of houses.Construction is only one of the Mafia’s revenues streams. Drug-dealing still represents a cash-cow, but in recent years criminal gangs have also made huge amounts from the exploitation of migrants: one wiretap from 2014 overheard a Rome mafiosi saying to a colleague: “do you have any idea how much one can earn through immigrants? Drug-trafficking yields less.”Apart from drugs- and people-smuggling, the Mafia is also adept at siphoning off European Union funding. The murder of the Slovakian journalist, Ján Kaliac, earlier this year is believed to have been a professional hit carried out because he was investigating Italian businessmen from Calabria who were embezzling EU funds.The other big-earner for criminal gangs is waste disposal. Here, like construction, it’s easy to make money if corners are cut.And through messing with rubbish collection – leaving it rotting on street corners at the height of the summer heat and the tourist season – organised criminals are able to hold cities hostage, making demands for contracts to be renegotiated.Not even Italy’s favourite sport is immune from the Mafia. Match-fixing in football is frequent in Italy, especially in the lower leagues.Every year or two there’s a scandal when it emerges that betting syndicates have made huge profits after bribing players to chuck games: The most recent case was in 2011, when dozens of teams and players colluded to arrange results, taking money from, and making it for, organised crime.The Mafia has even attempted to muscle in on the huge money to be made from ticket sales.In 2016 investigators in Turin discovered that the Calabrian Mafia, the ‘Ndrangheta, was procuring free tickets from Juventus in order to sell them on at huge profits: ticket-touting was estimated to yield €30,000 on match day.Ciccio Bucci, the man caught in the middle between Juventus and the Calabrian mafia, committed suicide in suspicious circumstances the day after being questioned by investigators.After Tuesday’s tragedy, infrastructure is now at the top of the Italian political agenda. If the taps are turned on again, you can be sure that the people who caused the problems will be offering, once again, to solve them.Tobias Jones lives in Parma.

Saturday will be a drier day for many areas, with just a scattering of showers, these mainly in the west.The best of the widespread sunshine will be during the latter part of the day and winds will tend to ease as the day progresses."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004264910171-e1534376158392.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"why the time has come for the beeb to stop believing in the cult of jeremy corbyn","story":"No?

That’s the kind of chap he is. Actually, I say that was the “latest” case of Corbyn simpering around terrorists.Not quite. A day or two later a photo emerged of him giving the salute of the Muslim Brotherhood, a foul organisation proscribed as terrorists in six countries.And it’s all part of the anti-Semitism scandal which is tearing the Labour Party apart.

Yep, the BBC.The corporation refused to touch the story for a whole day, when it was first reported by blogger Guido Fawkes. Ignored it.Everyone else — including the left-wing  — thought it important.Instead, the front page of the BBC’s online news carried no fewer than SIX stories about former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and the allegations of Islamophobia made against him. Six!Boris had likened women who wear the burka to letter boxes or bank robbers.The vast majority of the country agreed that he wasn’t being racist. The vast majority want the burka banned here — as it is in Denmark, France, parts of Germany, Belgium and . . . Morocco.His comments were not much of a story at all. And the moves to sanction him solely a case of his enemies in the Conservative Party gleefully hammering the bloke.But the BBC became obsessed by it. It is always obsessed when the word Islamophobia is mentioned.And it loves to stick the boot into the Tories. Yet was utterly silent on the latest example of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.It took them a full day to even mention the story.It’s another shocking case of the BBC’s bias. A left-liberal prejudice which runs right through the corporation from top to bottom.The same prejudice you hear whenever it deals with immigration (bloody marvellous!) or Brexit (absolutely ghastly!).Haven’t we had enough of this?

So, no women, gays or Jews, please.”This job has come up because the previous leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi (Bob Baghdad to his mates) got hit in a drone strike. According to the Islamic State, he is now brain-dead. Hmmm. How could they tell?A year or so back I was in a minicab at night on my way home when we approached the level crossing near my house.The gates were open and the driver, a foreign bloke, drove into the middle, stopped and said: “Sorry, left or right?” I looked at him to see if he was joking.He wasn’t. I said: “I would go straight on if I were you.“This what we, in this country, call a ‘railway line’.” I assume it’s his wife, then, who was caught driving her car along the Newcastle  this week.And only noticed she was actually on a railway when she pulled up at a station.An art student decided to do something about the bright light coming in through her window.There are a number of solutions, aren’t there?Curtains, for example. Or maybe some nice blinds.But nope, instead she covered her window with a painting. It was called Double Anal Penetration and was quite, um, graphic.The neighbours kicked up a bit of a fuss.There was also the suggestion the police could be called. The student’s name, incidentally?

Experts say communications between Tory whips should be released to the public. But the Cabinet Office has sparked fury by insisting the messages be kept secret. Government whips have frequently used messaging apps to coordinate Commons votes. The Mirror lodged an application for the messages sent through the chat - known as ‘WhipsApp’ - to coordinate Government business. But officials stunned transparency campaigners by claiming the messages are exempt from Freedom of Information laws because they are ‘political’ in nature. But the 17 Government whips are public office holders - effectively ministers. They pocket between \u0026pound25,000 and \u0026pound80,000 of taxpayers’ money on top of their MPs’ salary for doing the job.  FOI expert Matthew Burgess said: “Governments shouldn’t be avoiding transparency by hiding their work away from public view. Government business needs to be done in a clear way - there are exemptions in the FOI laws to allow policy discussions to be kept private - and that means making sure good records are kept.” “Technology shouldn’t be used as an excuse to circumvent openness.” Maintaining discipline in parliamentary votes has become vital to keeping Theresa May in office, since she lost her Commons majority in last year’s election. The Whips have reportedly used the WhipsApp group to maintain that organisation in a string of knife-edge votes, where the Prime Minister faced embarrassing defeats. And it is used to discuss so-called ‘pairing arrangements’, where MPs who cannot attend the Commons due to sickness or maternity leave.

Mr McCluskey, who is a close ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , said the party had been insensitive in not adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition in full.  But the Unite general secretary, writing for HuffPost UK, prefaced his comments with a blistering attack on Jewish community leaders for what he called their intransigent hostility to Mr Corbyn. Mr McCluskey said the problem of anti-Semitism in the party was not manufactured but had certainly been wildly exaggerated. He said: I am at a loss to understand the motives of the leadership of the Jewish community - the Board of Deputies, the Jewish Leadership Council and the Jewish Labour Movement. They raised entirely proper concerns, but have simply refused to take \u0027yes\u0027 for an answer.  Mr McCluskey said the more Corbyn has personally sought to build bridges with the Jewish community, the worse the rhetoric has become. He added: What is the response from the leading Jewish community organisations to this record of reaching out, of understanding, and of action? Intransigent hostility and an utter refusal to engage in dialogue about building on what has been done and resolving outstanding difficulties.  I therefore appeal to the leadership of the Jewish community to abandon their truculent hostility, engage in dialogue and dial down the rhetoric, before the political estrangement between them and the Labour Party becomes entrenched.  Mr McCluskey, calling for the IHRA definition to be adopted, said: Clearly, it would have been far better for the party to have adopted at least ten of the eleven IHRA examples in their original wording. Not doing so - and particularly without adequate consultation - was insensitive and bound to lead to misunderstanding, and also served to distract attention from the real issues at stake. It would be for the best if all eleven were now agreed, so the party can move on.

Robert Johnston successfully took a road resurfacing contractor to the small claims court after the firm refused to reimburse him for the damage. Mr Johnston\u0027s A6 was parked outside his business in Silverdale Road, Newcastle , last September when it was chipped by loose stones following the surface dressing of the road, the Stoke Sentinel reports. The 42-year-old repeatedly contacted both Staffordshire County Council, which is responsible for the road, and the firm contracted to carry out the work, Knutsford-based Road Management Services (RMS), with his concerns about the standard and safety of the surface.  RMS eventually wrote to Mr Johnston to say it had inspected the site and found \u0027no signs of loose aggregate\u0027 - and would therefore not offer him any compensation. Mr Johnston then launched a legal battle and, following a hearing at Stoke-on-Trent County Court, a judge ordered RMS to pay him \u0026pound4,211.20 in compensation, plus \u0026pound745 to cover his legal costs. The businessman, who owns Silverdale Motors, said: The court case was a dark cloud hanging over me. I was representing myself and it was quite a daunting experience. When the judge ruled in my favour I was really happy. It has been 10 months of hard work but it paid off. When you are right, you\u0027re right. The company has been negligent. Despite winning his legal battle, Mr Johnston remains concerned about the state of Silverdale Road.  The county council said if work on the road network was not up to standard, the contractor would have to remedy this at their own expense. Helen Fisher, cabinet member for Highways and Transport, said: “We have more than 6,000km of roads and the surface dressing programme plays a key role in reducing the risk of potholes.

The delivery driver added: Messed me about. You wasted half an hour cos of you. Lisa Jane Watson, from Warrington, Cheshire, was unable to take delivery of the package because her mother was in hospital with a broken hip. Lisa, 45, says she received 13 calls from an unknown London landline around the time of the delivery.  She answered on three occasions but the line was empty each time, meaning she ignored subsequent calls. The primary school teaching assistant says the disgusting note has made her scared to order online again and she has told her children not to answer the door. Lisa, an Amazon Prime customer, ordered Yankee candle plug-in refills on Monday and was told to expect delivery on Tuesday. She said: I had a couple of phone calls around lunchtime, which came up on my mobile as a London number. I ignored the first call but when they called back I answered it, the call then ended. They called again and I answered but again the call ended.  I then suspected it was a scam as it was a London number. I was then called numerous times but I declined each call. It was really frightening to receive so many calls like that. She added: I then arrived home at teatime to the note through the door and my parcel was left with a neighbour. As a single mum with two young girls. It\u0027s quite frightening that there is a driver out there that is that angry with me. I\u0027m scared to order anything again. When I saw the same neighbour he left it with getting a delivery, I was terrified that he [the driver] may come over to confront me. My safety chain is always on now and I\u0027ve told my girls not to answer the door. I got enough on my plate without all this added stress.

Still performing eight shows a week, even at 86 the idea of retirement sounds ridiculous to him. Brian believes he’ll carry on clowning until his final curtain. He says: “I joke to colleagues, ‘If I don’t come out of the box on stage just take it away and bury me’. “I feel alive on stage, so to take a final bow would not be such a bad way to go. I can’t stop working. It’s in my blood.” Brought up in Manchester with his grandma while his circus-performer parents Manz and Chico toured the world, Brian believes he was born to entertain. At 13 he did skits at a local zoo and loved it so much he left school a year early for a circus career.  “Something about the circus just drew me in,” he says. “When I was with my parents in the school holidays it would be natural to try juggling, rope throwing and things like discipline and work ethic. “Working as a clown’s assistant, hearing the audience react with laughter and applause was my reward and felt it was my natural home. I just felt like I belonged.” In a career spreading joy across the world, Brian won fans among Hollywood’s greatest stars, coached acrobatics to Great Britain athletes and, most proudly, performed with his \u0026shychildren Nicky and Sally.  For the past 20 years he has starred as the mischievous Brian Le Petit in Cirque Du Soleil’s show Mystere in Las Vegas. Recently he was honoured with a Las Vegas award for lifetime achievement, alongside Nicky. Brian says: “To be celebrated like this is astonishing as I never set out in my career to win awards, just entertain people. Working with the public keeps you fresh and on your feet. You never know what the audience will do – it makes it exciting and fun to go to work.  “I don’t think about my age really, it is just numbers. A lot of the Mystere troupe are around a third of my age. I find I feed off the energy of these whippersnappers. And I don’t think about stopping, What else am I going to do?” Brian has mastered far more than slapstick stunts and became known as one of the best tightrope walkers on the circus circuit. He says: “I was always athletic and sporty, so the wire was a starting point to expand on tricks. “For practice it was a couple of feet above ground, but I took one step out and then continued walking.  “I didn’t even think of coming off. It was just as normal as walking down the street. “Then I built into the act skipping, dancing and juggling while up there. I loved to get the laughs.” Brian also fell in love with singer Julie Dey and they married in 1959 and toured the world with their cabaret act. He says: “It was a great life. I’ll never forget the year in Africa, playing 200 shows, travelling by train. On the back car you could sit on the balcony, watching lions, giraffes and elephants in their habitat.  “Wherever we went we made friends and learned so much. Every day was an adventure and I had Julie to share the ride.” In 1965 Brian was flown to New York to appear on The Ed Sullivan Show four weeks before The Beatles performed. He says: “It was a big show and an honour, but I saw it as well-paid gig. People today would see that as an opportunity to break into TV and movies, but I was settled in my career.  “Afterwards an agent offered me a season at Radio City Music Hall but I wanted to get back to London to be with my wife as we’d just had our daughter Sally. “It never entered my mind to grow a career and try for Hollywood. If I stayed who knows if movies would have called? “But I don’t regret anything. Family had always been important to me and I was not going to leave to build a career thousands of miles away.” Brian bought an 18-bedroom property in New Cross, South East London, to use as both a family home and rental spot.  He and his wife’s parents moved in to help care for Sally and younger son Nicky while he performed his tightrope act. Brian was a coach for several Great Britain members in the late 1970s but the circus drew him back in and he joined London’s Circus UK as assistant director. At the same time what was then a small French-Canadian company, Cirque du Soleil, which was doing similar shows, came calling.  He says: “The bosses saw what we did and asked us to go to Montreal for workshops. I didn’t realise that was their audition. “They loved my comic ringmaster so much that they hired me for that and to work the tightrope with Sally and Nicky. It reinvigorated me with a love for the circus as I was now well into my 50s.” Cirque created artistic coordinator roles for Brian at new shows in Las Vegas and Europe. But on the opening night of “O” in Vegas in 1998 Julie died of pancreatic cancer.

Mrs Jackson received a huge backlash after she was quoted saying Spanish people \u0027 should go somewhere else for their holidays \u0027 following her trip with a friend to Poseidon Playa through travel operator Thomas Cook. Her granddaughter, Lyndsey Jackson, 32, has accused people of bullying after thousands slammed her for saying her accommodation was teeming with \u0027rude\u0027 native Spaniards - who nearly knocked her over on one occasion. The retired care assistant told  from her hospital room where she\u0027s recovering from knee surgery: It\u0027s all a pack of lies. I never said the Spanish should go to another hotel, just that the hotel didn\u0027t cater to English people. It\u0027s been totally taken out of context.  Now people who don\u0027t even know me are calling me racist which is just not true. I didn\u0027t slag the Spanish off at all. I had asked for a hotel in Benidorm\u0027s new town, on the flat that was close to shops. But they gave me a hotel on a hill in the old town far from everything. Mrs Jackson, who worked as a carer and auxiliary nurse for most of her life, said the public backlash against her has been disgusting. She suffers from chronic arthritis and went into hospital on Monday for a knee replacement. But as she came out of theatre, in serious pain and confined to hospital, she was met with the news that story had hit the headlines.  Mrs Jackson had booked to stay at the Poseidon Playa, located on the outskirts of Benidorm in south east Spain, with a friend in April 2017. The pensioner says Thomas Cook had even recommended the hotel and despite her request for flat ground access, it was located on a slope instead. Mrs Jackson and her 61-year-old friend paid a total of \u0026pound1,133 for the holiday and have demanded a full refund or a free trip. Ahead of the trip the flights from Manchester to Allicante had been changed but she was not informed until she went to collect her tickets. Added to the that the hotel was not in the location she requested and she found it difficult to get around with her painful knee and mobility issues. She said she had never complained about a holiday before, but added that this one was a disaster from start to finish. She was quoted saying the \u0027hotel was full of rude Spanish holidaymakers\u0027 and that the entertainment in the hotel was all focused and catered for the Spanish adding: Why can\u0027t the Spanish go somewhere else for their holidays?

The BBC has obtained a recording of Graf’s address and the corporation understands Abedi bought at ticket for the Ariana Grande concert 10 days later. Abedi killed 22 and injured hundreds at the concert when he detonated a suicide bomb. One Muslim expert last night said Graf’s sermon was “brainwashing” young people. Abedi, aged 22, and his family regularly attended the mosque in Didsbury south Manchester and his father Ramadan sometimes led the call to prayer.  It is unknown whether Abedi – or any family members - attended the mosque on the day of the audio recording. The sermon by Mustafa Graf, which was delivered at the time of the bombing of Aleppo, included prayers for “Mujahideen” – a term used for a group fighting armed jihad abroad. “We ask Allah to grant them Mujahideen - our brothers and sisters right now in Aleppo and Syria and Iraq - to grant them victory”, he says. Elsewhere Graf says, “Jihad for the sake of Allah is the source of pride and dignity for this nation”. In another passage he says “now it is time to act and do something”.  The sermon centres on the suffering in Syria and includes an appeal for donations, with Graf at one point saying “the whole world, including Europe, America, what is the so-called civilised world” is watching what is happening in Aleppo and Syria. “They know that Iran, Russia and the militias are killing humans in Syria and they do nothing. Well in fact they helped Iranian, Russian and others to kill Muslims over there.” BBC News played the audio for two Muslim scholars who said they both believe the language of the sermon represents a call for armed jihad.

Preston Green was eating cheese and onion Wheat Crunchies when he approached his parents Adam and Chelsea, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, gagging and complaining something was trapped in his throat. In a desperate rush to save his son’s life, panic-stricken Adam, 26, smacked Preston on the back before a silver object, around two inches long, shot out of his mouth. Adam and 24-year-old Chelsea were horrified when they realised their son had been choking on a spring - which they claim came from the crisp packet.  Describing the horrific ordeal which occurred at their family home on Wednesday, Adam told the : We always buy the Wheat Crunchies because they are the boys’ favourite crisps. “We’d bought a multi-pack from Home Bargains in Kettering and Preston asked for a packet so I grabbed a bag to give to him. “Minutes after he started eating them, he runs up to us and starts complaining something was in his throat - he was gagging and choking.” The horrified parents, who also have son Leyton, aged five, reacted instantly, realising something was trapped Preston\u0027s airway.  Adam added: “I smacked him on the back and got it out. It was part of a crisp, but wrapped around it was this spring. “It was the size of the Wheat Crunchie - about two inches long I would say.” Adam said Preston went on to complain of pain in his teeth after the traumatic ordeal, likely caused by the spring which he had unknowingly bitten down on. The dad added: It was frightening, but thankfully nothing really serious happened, and Preston is OK, apart from complaining about pain in his teeth. Adam took pictures of the spring and contacted manufacturer KP Snacks, revealing how they had gone through one of every parent\u0027s worst nightmares - witnessing their child choking on a piece of food.

Conor Ashton, who nicknamed himself \u0027The Stalking Ransacker,\u0027 targeted single women and held them at knife point while rifling through their underwear drawers. Most of the time, the victims were not at home. But on the last two occasions before he was arrested, he broke into the homes of two women while they were asleep. The dangerous 23-year-old stood over the victims as they slept before using plastic cable ties to bind them while he ransacked their homes, stealing debit cards and phones. He helped himself to hot chocolate and wine as he rooted through their underwear drawers and then laid out garments on beds. A court heard how in a number of disturbing raids, Ashton tagged the houses of his victims with bizarre graffiti which included insults directed at police officers, and pentagrams.  He even left a running total of the number of burglaries he said he had carried out across a four-year period in the Essex town. Chelmsford Crown Court heard how Ashton was obsessed with Satanic killer Richard Ramirez who murdered at least 14 people in attacks that terrorised California in 1985. Cold-blooded killer Ramirez, who started out with burglaries, also left occult symbols at his crime scenes. Ashton was finally arrested by cops with an expert linking his handwriting to the graffiti left behind at homes he’d raided. The former farm worker admitted six counts of burglary and two charges of aggravated burglary. Dressed in a green tracksuit top, white shirt and blue jeans, he cried during his sentencing hearing.  As he was jailed today Judge Christopher Morgan branded him a dangerous offender who had targeted young single women. Stephen Rose, prosecuting, revealed shocking details of the crimes which began in 2013. Ashton burgled a series of university student properties close to his Colchester home but by last year the raids became shockingly violent. On July 10 last year a woman woke to find Ashton next to her bed ‘pointing a blade in her direction’. Mr Rose said: ‘He told the victim not to scream. “He was wearing a black balaclava, black top, black trousers and wearing black gloves and a black rucksack.” Twisted Ashton told the woman to hand over her debit card and pin number, warning her that her housemate was being held by another man.  “He told the victim he would not hurt her, instructed her to lie back before producing two plastic ties and tied her hands and ankles,” Mr Rose said. Ashton then left and his victim waited 20 minutes before calling out to her housemate who was fine and had not seen another person in the house. Ashton, whose family were sat in the packed courtroom, used the debit card to take \u0026pound500 out in three separate withdrawals. Just a month later, on August 14, he broke into a home and tied up another woman with cable ties. She ran shouting and screaming from her home into the arms of her shocked neighbours.  The woman told police she had woken up to the sight of a man at the end of her bed. Balaclava-clad Ashton told her he would not harm her and asked for money before tying her wrists. Mr Rose said Ashton told the woman ‘tell the pigs I had fun on Avon Way [the scene of his earlier raid]. “I already know my next target. It will be next week sometime.” Detectives investigating the case located a laptop stolen in a burglary which they traced back to Ashton. Police arrested Ashton the following month and during a search of his house they found a backpack containing gloves, a balaclava and zip ties.  Officers noticed how Aston had drawn pentagrams on his walls. His computer was seized and it revealed a search for ‘the original night stalker’ as well as for British Army forensics. Mr Rose added: “Part of the Crown’s case is the defendant appears, to some extent, to have modelled himself on a serial offender in America.” The court heard how Ashton had left graffiti in the houses appearing to taunt police. In one case he wrote: \u0027The Stalking Ransacker’, \u002735th burglary\u0027. \u0027Police Suck’, ‘Media Attention’. Ashton’s handwriting from a college application was matched by an expert to the graffiti. He denied involvement at first before later changing his pleas and admitting the string of raids. Richard Conley, mitigating, said the offences were completely out of character for Ashton, suggesting they had in some part been due to him using drugs.

A team of three vets, a nurse, three dermatologists and five more park staff were on hand when 97.6 stone (620kg) Victor needed to be given an allergy test. Such was the bear\u0027s bulk, Press Association photographer Danny Lawson was also asked to put down his camera and help manoeuvre Victor into a comfortable position after he had been anaesthetised. A major operation was put in place after Victor and his smaller friend, Nobby, began suffering from abscesses on their feet.  Staff suspected it was caused by an allergic reaction to pollen after moving from concrete bear pit enclosures elsewhere to the more natural setting at the attraction near Doncaster. Dermatologists from Liverpool University were brought in to carry out tests on Victor\u0027s skin, once he had safely been put under, to verify the theory. The results will be known in the coming days.  Animal manager Debbie Porter said: It has been a bonkers day. Victor was shaved and there are about 50 test sites on his side. Fingers crossed we can find out which allergies he has and we can set about making life more comfortable for him.

But she\u0027s not the first royal bride to have family troubles, and her late mother-in-law vowed never to speak to her mum again after a series of shocking conversations. Princess Diana\u0027s butler and close friend claims Frances Shand Kydd called her a whore and launched into a hate-filled personal attack on the men she was dating and their religious beliefs. During an interview with the Mirror several years ago, Paul Burrell revealed details of a particularly shocking conversation between the two women just months before Diana\u0027s death.  He revealed further details about their difficult relationship at Diana\u0027s inquest . The telephone conversation referred to Diana\u0027s relationships with heart surgeon Hasnat Khan and businessman Gulu Lalvani. Mr Burrell said: I heard her call, Paul, come quick. She was hanging over the banister shouting down. She waved me over with her hand. I joined her on the floor cross-legged and stuck close beside her. I leant my ear as near to the phone as possible and listened to the conversation - albeit one-way. It was the slurring voice of Mrs Frances Shand Kydd. What I heard was a torrent of abuse, swearing and upsetting innuendo towards the Princess and towards the male company she was keeping.  It was a hate-filled personal attack on the men and their religious beliefs. The conversation ended when Diana slammed the phone, and Mr Burrell later found her sitting on the lounge floor crying. He claims Diana vowed never to speak to her mother again - and she never did. He said: How prophetic and sad those words were - because she didn\u0027t. It is something her mother will have to live with for the rest of her life. At Diana\u0027s inquest, Mr Burrell was asked to speak about the phone conversations she had asked him to listen into. However he was hesitant, replying simply: Respectfully that\u0027s not very kind to a lady who\u0027s no longer here.

But while some did as well as you may think, others achieved just a handful of qualifications - and one particularly high profile royal achieved none. Despite having what has been described as an aptitude for learning, The Queen didn\u0027t have time for formal schooling, having to instead learn the constitutional monarchy ropes from a young age. In contrast, her children and grandchildren have enjoyed a more normal education - and varying degrees of success to show for it.   So how do the royals qualifications measure up? Prince William From 1990, William attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire for five years until he started at Eton College in 1995 where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. He left Eton in 2000 achieving an A in Geography B Art and C Biology. Like many students, The Duke of Cambridge chose to have a gap year before beginning his university course in order to travel and gain a variety of new experiences. He went on to gain a 2:1 degree in Geography at St Andrews University in Scotland, which is where he met his wife, while they were students in residence at St Salvator\u0027s Hall.   The Duke of Cambridge initially began a four-year History of Art degree in 2001 but changed his major to Geography after two years.  The Duchess of Cambridge Kate achieved 11 GCSEs at St. Andrew’s School in Pangbourne in 1995 and then went on to Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where she achieved As in Maths and Art, and a B in English. Leaving Marlborough College in July 2000, The Duchess of Cambridge undertook a gap year in which she studied at the British Institute in Florence, undertook a Raleigh International programme in Chile, and crewed on Round the World Challenge boats in the Solent. Kate graduated from St Andrews University in 2005 with a 2:1 in History of Art  Prince Harry Probably one of the least academic achievers is Prince Harry, who studied at Eton, gaining 11 GCSE\u0027s and a B in Art and D in Geography in his A Levels. On the royal\u0027s website it simply says: His Royal Highness went on to Eton College from September 1998 where he took his GCSEs and A Levels. On William\u0027s it outlines the three A Levels he took. Harry had plenty of successes though throughout his education and during his time at Eton, he was House Captain of Games and represented the school at rugby, cricket and polo, and was a member of the Combined Cadet Force.  He left in 2003 and joined the Army, but before doing so, he spent a year travelling to Australia, Argentina and Africa, where he made a documentary about the plight of orphans in Lesotho.  The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle Meghan began her secondary education at Immaculate Heart High School in 1992 where she was known as a hard working and focused student. During her high school years, The Duchess of Sussex performed in theatrical productions at both Immaculate Heart and Loyola High School. Her former drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, who directed Meghan in seven plays, remembered that her former student sparkled.  She said: You see someone nice to the other kids, who gets good grades, doesn\u0027t say anything bad about anybody. America does not test students using GCSEs or A Levels, and it has not been reported what Meghan got on her SATs (which is the test students take as an entry into university) but it is known that she got the grades she needed to get into university. She went on gain a double major in Theatre and International Relations at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in 2003. During her time at university, The Duchess completed an internship at the US Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she learned to speak Spanish. She also studied French for six years.  The Queen She\u0027s met politicians and film stars, speaks French fluently, loves to colour block and still rides a horse at 92 years of age, but the Queen has never sat an academic exam in her life meaning she hasn\u0027t a single GCSE or A Level (O Levels back then) to her name. In her early childhood, the Queen was taught by a governess from 9.30am until 11am. Following the abdication of her uncle Edward VIII in 1938, Elizabeth needed to prepare herself for her future role and received lessons on constitutional history from the vice provost of Eton, Henry Marten. The Queen’s father had disliked school and her mother thought it was more important to have fun,’ Professor Kate Williams, author of Young Elizabeth told Good Housekeeping . Unlike her father, the Queen was and is very bright and had an appetite for learning as well as a razor sharp memory. The lack of a formal education didn\u0027t harm her as she\u0027s naturally analytical and something of an autodidact, as well as being hard working - which we know now is just as important as raw brainpower.    Prince Charles Prince Charles was educated at Gordonstoun where he achieved five O-levels (GCSEs) and two A-levels - a B in History and a C in French. He then went on to Cambridge University where he achieved a 2:2 degree in History Legend has it his bodyguard who was present at all lectures with the young prince sat the exams too - and got a First. Princes Diana Princess Diana met with less success and failed all her O-levels, twice. However she apparently excelled in deportment, having attended finishing school in Switzerland.  Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, attended Benenden school in Kent where she gained six O-levels, and three A-levels in English, History and Politics. While Prince Andrew attended Gordonstoun like his older brother, his academic choices were much like Anne\u0027s - six O-levels and A-levels in English, History and Politics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Prince Edward also went to Gordonstoun and has nine O-levels, three A-levels in English, History and Politics. He then gained a 2:2 degree in History from Cambridge University.

Dr Philippa Whitford said the growing likelihood of no deal left the Tories desperate for a trade pact with Donald Trump – at any cost.

The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s relationship with her family has been closely scrutinised in recent months as Buckingham Palace struggles to prevent further embarrassing media interviews by her father Markle and half-sister Samantha. The 37-year-old royal described how she has little tolerance for those she considers \u0027dishonest\u0027 or \u0027disloyal\u0027 in a post shared to her now defunct website, The Tig, in 2014.  The quote is attributed to Portuguese author Jose Micard Tiexera and was recently reshared by Instagram account harry_meghan_updates.   It read: I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me.  I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me. I no longer spend a single minute on those who lie or want to manipulate. In friendship I dislike the lack of loyalty and betrayal, it continues. I do not get along with those who do not know how to give a compliment or a word of encouragement. The post is believed to have been published shortly after her split from her first husband film producer Trevor Engeleson in 2011. The pair divorced in 2013 - just two years after exchanging vows at their lavish wedding in Jamaica.  The post may also be aimed at her former maid-of-honour whom she is no longer on speaking terms with.

There’s no guarantees I bring a striker in and he’s going to do better but we need to bring players in for those areas.“That being said we do work.

It has been non-stop.“It was only five days and my first game so I need to know how my team-mates play.“I had four training sessions so it was a little bit crazy but it was good to help the team to win by scoring.“I’m happy with the start but the three points were the most important thing.“We have to start to win games but when I score it is always nice.“It was a good pass from Frederic Frans and I saw the goalkeeper went down so I just wanted to put it behind him and I think it was a good strike.“I think the first half was a good performance and we need to build on that.“The second half wasn’t perfect so we need to change something there.”Safranko joined the club on a year-long loan deal from Danish side Aalborg last week.He was well-known to manager Csaba Laszlo, though, as they worked together at Dunajska Streda (DAC) in Slovakia.There, Safranko knocked in six goals in 12 games after signing for the second half of the season as DAC went on an extended unbeaten run.And the chance to work with Csaba once more was a big draw for the striker once he heard Aalborg were happy to let him leave.He said: “I played under Csaba Laszlo in Slovakia at Dunajska Streda.“There we were unbeaten for 16 games in a row so I know what I can expect from him and I’m looking forward to playing for him again.“Csaba was the big part of why I joined Dundee United because I had a really good relationship with Csaba. I want to work for him.“I can honestly say that in Denmark there is a bit more combination football but here it is a little bit more fighting which will, hopefully, suit me better.“I can say every player dreams to play football in the United Kingdom so this was also one of the reasons I came here.”Safranko certainly knows the Scottish Championship is about “fighting” as he was given a welcome by the Queens backline.The makings of a black eye was clear in the Slovak’s face during and after the game as he battled with the Palmerston defenders.“I heard the Scottish league is quite hard – now I can feel it!” he added.“It is my style and how I play. We will see, I don’t want to speak too much because it was just my first game.”The Tangerines now have the best part of two weeks before their next Championship fixture – time Safranko thinks they can use to their advantage.“We will have time to train and I’m sure with this squad we can be much better in our next game.“The first half was our good phase because I had Nicky Clark close to me. He is a good player, and we can build on it.“Everyone fought and we have to continue with that because if just one person loses a battle, we will have problems.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7540a9bb2e3-846x564.jpg ","title":"organisers of scottish independence march give assurances as thousands more set to walk dundee streets than expected","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOrganisers of a Scottish independence march have given assurances that Saturday’s event will go off without a hitch \u0026#8211 despite potentially thousands more people turning up than originally expected.The March for Independence, organised by All Under One Banner, will see protesters take to the streets in support of breaking away from the UK.A list of notifications on Dundee City Council’s website states 1,000 marchers are expected to descend on the city.But organisers now expect anywhere between 10,000 and 20,000 people to show up. A post on the Carse of Gowrie SNP Facebook page put the number of expected marchers at 25,000.So far only 2,300 people have confirmed their attendance through Facebook, with another 4,200 interested.Marchers will start at Baxter Park at 12.45pm and finish at Magdalen Green.Colin Clement, chairman of the Stobswell Forum, said there were no concerns about the march.He said: “We had been aware the march was taking place and large numbers of people could be expected.“The park can certainly accommodate large numbers of people and the business in the area would welcome the additional footfall.”Event organiser Mandeep Singh promised adequate provisions would be in place amid concerns about toilet facilities in Magdalen Green.He said: “We initially said there could be 1,000 people there. It’s hard for us to gauge how many people will come along on the day.“Provisions are in place to accommodate 10,000 people or more. It’s a family event that we hope will be a great boost for the city and attract people from all over Scotland and the world.“We’ve held great events all over Scotland. An event in Dumfries was attended by over 10,000 people.“It finishes at Magdalen Green, I would like to assure residents that not everyone will stay around there.”West End councillor Richard McCready said: “I defend anyone’s right to protest in a peaceful and orderly manner. But there seems to be a clear disparity on the numbers expected to attend. The organisers have chosen to finish at Magdalen Green with permission from the licensing committee.“It will be a case of seeing what condition the green is in afterwards. I’m sure organisers will be making sure it’s kept in good condition.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/Sam-Jones-in-the-crowd-for-Dundee-v-Aberdeen.jpg.jpg ","title":"rejected sam jones turns down dundee after talks with neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann has been hit with a blow in his bid to sign a goalscorer after he was turned down by Sam Jones.Dundee and Shrewsbury Town had agreed a five-figure fee and the 26-year-old saw was a Dens Park spectator in the directors\u0026#8217 box on Saturday as McCann\u0026#8217s men went down 1-0 to Aberdeen.But after considering a switch to the SPFL, he has now returned to the Shrews and trained with John Askey’s squad today.Although born in Barnsley, he has represented Wales youth at youth level.Jones only joined the Shrews in January after spells at National League outfit Gateshead and League Two Grimsby Town that saw him among the goals on a regular basis.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b75409ab4e77-846x564.jpg ","title":"revealed dundee landmarks to welcome visitors for free doors open day event","story":"\t\t\t\t\tVisitors will get free access to some of Dundee’s top attractions next month as the official Doors Open Day programme is revealed.Venues across the city will open up on September 8 and 9, allowing people a behind-the-scenes look into some of the city’s hidden histories.Among places joining the programme for the first time is Avertical World in Blinshall Street, Tayside’s only dedicated indoor climbing centre.Morgan Academy – which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year – will also be taking part in the event.Following a catastrophic fire in 2001, the school had an internal rebuild and reopened in August 2004.The building has remained an iconic landmark of Stobswell since its grand opening in 1868.Dundee University will be putting on a new guided tour of Hawkhill House.Behind Duncan of Jordanstone College, the farmhouse is now home to the stores and offices of the university’s museum services.Other venues including Dundee Sheriff Court are making their return to the event after a break.Grove Academy is showcasing its archive material from the First World War and Second World War, with research material about former pupils who lost their lives during the conflicts being displayed.Lord Provost Ian Borthwick said the event is a “significant” date in the calendar for the City of Discovery.He said: “It is a great opportunity for the public to see what goes on behind the scenes.“We have so many public buildings but never know what goes on behind it.“I have visited a number of these events and hope it is a success.“I was visiting a few former pupils of Morgan Academy last year. The school has a great affinity with its pupils and the restoration has been remarkable.”Councillor Borthwick said the event could also have a positive effect on local businesses.“I think it welcomes people and opens up the city to new people,” he said.“It also helps local businesses because it stimulates people’s interest in the city.“We are so used to passing these buildings – but events like these help us learn to appreciate them.”For a full list of venues taking part click here.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b753f8bd3725.jpg ","title":"revealed winners of the 10000 tele community chest giveaway","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMore than 32,000 tokens were collected by more than 60 charitable groups in our Community Chest competition.And now, with all the totals tallied, the winners can be revealed.The competition saw non-profit community groups in the Tayside area collect at least 50 tokens to be in with a chance to win a share of £10,000.A massive 32,606 tokens were sent back to us from 61 groups, with organisations split into three categories depending on their size.The community group taking away the most money from category A, with groups with up to 30 members, is the Glenlaw House parent/carer support group, who won £410.83.The group are the parents and carers of severely disabled children.\u0026nbspChairman Allan Petrie said: “It’s brilliant.

deal from the Premier League giants.The 22-year-old goes straight into contention to start against St Mirren in the League Cup at Pittodrie on Saturday.Former England U21 international Wilson made an immediate impact at Manchester United when scoring twice on his senior debut in 2014 at just 18 years old.Since then Wilson has suffered a cruciate ligament injury that ruled him out for 10 months and a number of loan spells.McInnes is confident Wilson will be a major player for the Dons this season and score goals.However, he has also called for others throughout the team to hit the back of the net – from the defence to attack.He said: “I could do with more in the team expecting to score.“That goes throughout – whether it is centre-halves coming up for corners, midfielders.“I need more of that intent of ‘I am going to score today’, rather than hoping to score.“If you just hope to score you don’t normally get that.”McInnes had been hunting all summer to sign a striker to add fire-power and a different option to his attack.He also attempted  to land a defender in time for the 1-0 win at Dundee due to a rearguard crisis with four players ruled out through suspension or injury.Scotland international centre-back Scott McKenna is out for six weeks with  a hamstring tear, while Shaleum Logan is suspended.On-loan defender Tommie Hogan is out with a knee injury, while centre-back Mark Reynolds is out for six months following knee surgery.However, with players set to return McInnes has admitted he could hang fire with signing cover defensively.Right-back Logan will be back for next week’s trip to Hibs, while Hoban could be back a week or two after that.McKenna is set to miss only the next three games as there is an international break following the home clash with Kilmarnock on September 1.Despite the defensive crisis, a makeshift rearguard secured a clean sheet – with keeper Joe Lewis producing a vital save late on at Dens Park.McInnes praised Lewis‘ high levels so far this season.He said: “We have as good a goalie as there in the premiership and Joe has shown that time and time again.“Against Dundee it was a save Joe should be making, and it was a save that had to be made and he did.“Joe’s level of performances since he came in have been different class.“He has started the season very well and I am pleased for him to get the clean sheet.“The level of opponent we

But it’s been great for her to spend time with her little sister, and she’s happy to have them back.”The youngster was given the prognosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 14 months – the neurological condition causes constant stiffness and tightness of leg and arm muscles, making mobility difficult.The family had previously thought treatment in the US was the only option and had set about raising £70,000 when they received the good news that Olivia had been deemed an ideal candidate for the operation in Bristol.Olivia is currently gearing up to go back to school next Tuesday.Senga hopes that she’ll be ready to go back with her classmates, and says they’ll “play it by ear” for the first few weeks.She said: “We’ll just need to see how she gets on, and if she needs to reduce her time at school then that’s what we’ll do.”Senga hopes that the surgery will now make Olivia able to do things that her friends and classmates can.She said: “So much has changed for her, she can sit on a bench now, she can sit crossed legged, it doesn’t sound like a big thing, but it is for her.“It’s little steps, and it’s good for her that she can be part of that.“I know that sitting on a bench isn’t a big thing, but her sitting with her classmates is a big thing for her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b752334e0906-884x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen sandwich shop cleans up with glowing report1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen sandwich shop that was criticised by inspectors earlier this year has now been given a glowing report.Aberdeen City Council sent an inspector for a routine check of Deja Vu food shop on Rose Street in March and their report said improvement was needed.The inspector expressed concern about the condition of some of the equipment and cleanliness.Several insects were spotted in the back kitchen area, which is not used for food preparation.The business’s owner, Roy Duncan, said he immediately called in pest controllers and the insects were removed within hours.He added that he spoke with the council inspectors in depth so he was able to attend to their concerns.According to the council, the premises was re-inspected on June 8 and they gave it a pass rating – meaning that all the original concerns had been dealt with.Mr Duncan, who has been in the food trade for 30 years, said: “It was quite a shock because, having been in the trade for so long, I had always passed these inspections and known exactly what gets you a pass and what doesn’t. I was surprised.“I also disagreed with what the council said.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Fraser Watt gave them the lead on 17 minutes and Lewis Montgomery added a second on 33 minutes.A second from Fraser Watt five minutes later made it 3-0 at the break.James Cameron pulled a goal back for Inverness on 54 minutes but most of the pressure was around the Inverness goal. Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"soccer centre scores with support from ardrishaig community trust","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIn a fantastic boost for youth football in Mid Argyll, the Ardrishaig Community Trust and Lochgilphead Soccer Centre have jointly announce that Ardrishaig Community Trust will be the main sponsor of Lochgilphead Soccer Centre for the next three years.The funding package, worth £5,000 for each of the next three years, will make a huge contribution to the centre’s ambitious development plans – it already has more than 120 members, including around 40 from Ardrishaig.The development plan will see the Soccer Centre invest in new equipment, quality coaching to help the youngsters develop their football skills, participation in football festivals, and attend Scotland games, among other things.The funding will meet the cost of around 100 new football strips, all branded with Ardrishaig Community Trust, and will help ensure all Lochgilphead Red Star YFC teams are kitted out the same, from primary one to sevens (including the girls’ teams).The cost of kit to keep the coaches – who contribute the equivalent of around £15,000 a year in time – warm and dry throughout the year, will be part funded by the sponsorship. The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK. The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notifications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notifications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specifying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item if they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notifications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identification. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels (including returns) to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 3:16 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSomething slightly different in this edition.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

We look forward to VisitScotland accepting our proposals and working with us to ensure a smooth transfer of the facility over the coming weeks.\u0026#8216A lot of work will need to be carried out before the transfer and anyone wishing to volunteer should get in touch through our website.\u0026#8217A VisitScotland spokesman said: \u0026#8216We are currently in discussions with Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust about proposals for future use of the property and have the support of the local community.\u0026#8217Tarbert businessman Ian Macintyre believes the transfer of the premises should be a formality. He told the Advertiser: \u0026#8216In the original constitution for the Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islay tourist board, the last paragraph is that in the event of this situation, any assets should transferred to an appropriate local body. I think that should still hold.\u0026#8217The trust\u0026#8217s asset transfer plan is backed by Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, who said: \u0026#8216I made it clear when this plan was first announced that there would have to be alternatives in place before any closure. That remains my position and I am concerned that, for example, there is still no fast mobile phone speeds and broadband in some parts of the area which are necessary to get information from the developing providers.\u0026#8216I have been supporting the proposal from the community trust for the Tarbert premises and I am hopeful that there can be an asset transfer, not least because it seems that the building was only given to VisitScotland on the understanding that if it stopped using it, it would revert to another body doing the same sort of work.\u0026#8217Councillor Alastair Redman added: \u0026#8216I would support the Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust in their talks to ask for an asset handover and take over the tourist centre building.\u0026#8217VisitScotland states that tourist information provision will continue across Argyll and Bute through a network of more than 130 VisitScotland Information Partners (VIPs) primarily based in hotels and guest houses, with three of these in Tarbert, four in Campbeltown and two in Inveraray, alongside \u0026#8216outreach\u0026#8217 staff attending events around the country.\u0026#8216It’s going to be a big miss in the village.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure.

He made a good impression on a whistle-stop tour of Dalmellington and Bellsbank. But time will tell whether or not this will bring voters back to the fold. Mr Leonard chatted amiably to lady volunteers at the Kirk Shop, in the middle of Dalmellington. There was clearly lots of goodwill for the Yorkshire-born politician. The affable Labour leader then moved on to Dalmellington Care Centre, where he planted a red rose to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS. “My grandfather was a gardener, back in Leeds,” said Mr Leonard, as he wielded a spade. He heard about grassrooots co-operation in Dalmellinton among groups like The Zone and the care centre.  Mr Leonard said: “It’s the resilience of the people that’s keeping the Doon Valley going. “But it’s about time they were given a helping hand from government. “There are too many people living in poverty and on poverty pay. “We need investment in public services and we need to see communities having more control, with the possibility of community buy-outs.” Mr Leonard said only Labour is pledging a decade of investment. “We’re the only party opposing the austerity policies of the Tories, which are being passed on by the SNP.” He said the SNP’s own Growth Commission report revealed there would be even more austerity in an independent Scotland. And he was adamant: “The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to a second referendum on independence.”  Labour colleague Colin Smyth MSP said: “We’re seeing a growing frustration among voters on a debate focused on the constitution. “People want to see improvements in education and health.” Mr Leonard popped up to Bellsbank to see how streets are being transformed with ‘Balamory’ style painting of houses. In the afternoon, he visited the Sovereign Credit Union in Cumnock to hear about its services in the community. Then it was on to Tarbolton, to meet residents who are unhappy about their doctors’ surgery hours being cut, due to a shortage of GPs.

The roof was taken off and the chambers filled with earth, and in the course of a short time the effects of the weather made themselves apparent. The walls cracked in every direction, and large masses of the building fell.\nNext the crowbar was applied with great success and to make the appearance of an ancient ruin as near perfect as possible, a cartwheel was fixed in one of the largest rents, that the effect at a distance might be that of a venerable abbey.

allow the community garden, established at the rear of the building, to continue.Mr Avery, who moved to Kintyre from New Zealand, said: \u0026#8216Since Auchinlee was put on the market I have approached Anthony Zdanowicz, D M Hall\u0026#8217s associate handling the sale for CrossReach and the Church of Scotland , to ask whether they would consider alternative proposals or a

the decisions.\u0026#8217In an email to the Courier last week, Mr Zdanowicz said: \u0026#8216I have offers currently with my client for consideration and instructions and I hope to have it ‘under

before when I was a teenager I lived in one of the prefabs on Hillside Road.My friends and I would often head for Dalintober beach, commonly known as Banana Beach, where we would spend some pocket money on Jock Shields\u0026#8217 kayaks.There were about six or seven kayaks to hire for a shilling or two and go just about anywhere, in all weathers, for an hour, not a life jacket to be seen.Jock or John Shields ran a bicycle shop on Longrow but was into many things and also had a ship carousel at Banana Beach.The carousel wasn\u0026#8217t unlike one at the fair but consisted of seven or eight little cargo ships and cruise boats, all home made I think, for one child in each boat.They were attached to a centre spindle with one ship only having an outboard motor making the whole assembly rotate.I\u0026#8217m not sure if it was Jock or someone else who hired out rowing boats from the slipway in the harbour.We would hire two seater or four seater boats, the former being cheaper and we could always pick up another crew member when out of sight of the hirer.Rowing  to the large mooring buoy in the middle of the loch was no big deal, neither was accepting a dare to ride out the wake from the Duchess of Hamilton or Montrose sideways on.I\u0026#8217m sweating thinking about it as there were no lifejackets, we must have been crazy.Other memories of Banana Beach were the toilets and shelter at the top of the pier now long gone, and the push button drinking fountain at the wall near the beach slipway.Happy days indeed.  Good luck to those trying to restore it for today\u0026#8217s

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland.

The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.

And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag.

Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company was considering a number of sites with Prestonpans Community Councillor Calum Miller suggesting the former\u0026nbspCockenzie Power Station site could be\u0026nbspa possible home for it or\u0026nbsped that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.  A spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThis is an indication of high commuting rates out of East Lothian and the nature of the East Lothian economy \u0026ndash eg. rural, hospitality, part-time/seasonal \u0026ndash that tend to pay lower rates. The refreshed East Lothian Economic Development Strategy will outline the context of such differences and consider means of appropriate support for the local economy and workforce.  The average UK gross weekly wage in 2017 was \u0026pound552 while the Scottish average was \u0026pound547."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8157352.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"work-taking-place-at-blindwells-ahead-of-houses-being-built-there","story":"  Planning permission for homes at Blindwells, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie, was granted in spring last year.

It is one of the few islands on the West Coast I don\u0026rsquot know, and for sure I will be back. It is a less-known treasure, I think.  I was camping with my family so our accommodation was pretty basic, but the kids absolutely loved it. As I write, we have just returned and I am in recovery mode from five nights under canvas.  We could afford it because my wife and I were stewards, two shifts each then we were able to access the festival. My main responsibility was the \u0026lsquobeach gate\u0026rsquo, a quieter access point which allowed festival-goers to visit the beach and return without needing to go through the main gate.  And so there I was, with a high-visibility vest and a walkie-talkie, checking people\u0026rsquos wrist bands as they left and entered. I met lots of wonderful people, but most of the time I was sitting on a mound of sand by the gate, admiring the stunning view of Ettrick Bay and the mountains of Arran in the distance.  It was a rare and wonderful time for reflection. The rest of the family were nearby but having a ball inside, so I was free to enjoy my thoughts.  There was a prehistoric standing stone circle close to the site of the festival which gave the same view I was enjoying. It made me realise that although I had vague idea of the general history of the area, I did not know the tales steeped in the landscape.  Story anchors our relationship with the land, and sitting in that beautiful and wild place made me want to make that connection there as well. I can simply enjoy a view, of course, but perhaps a burden storytellers carry is the need to pick the wisps of stories from the land wherever we go.  I thought of a possible connection with East Lothian in the travels of St Kenneth. He was a monk from Ireland and an associate of St Columba. He must have known this shore, perhaps he walked the sand of Ettrick Bay itself.  His name is embedded in many place names, both in Ireland and Scotland, and one of them is Cockenzie. The legend states that this name comes from the Gaelic Cul Cionnich, meaning Kenneth\u0026rsquos Cove.  He is said to have arrived in the small picturesque natural harbour, now called the Boat Shore, in the sixth century, and thus baptised the community with his name. The Boat Shore was for many years the harbour of what was to become the village of Cockenzie. For sure it seems the saint\u0026rsquos travels took him to the Forth valley so the legend may be rooted in a real event.  I love the Boat Shore at Cockenzie. I played there in my childhood, as so many have. Both high and low tide has it different pleasures there.  I reflected on the fact that perhaps the main difference between the Boat Shore and Ettrick Bay on Bute is not their varying size but the fact that Cockenzie is now \u0026lsquobuilt up\u0026rsquo.  Yet when I walked the shore from Port Seton to Cockenzie recently, the sea was no less dominant on my senses. In fact the remains of old salt pans, the survival of a fishing community and its traditions, the gable ends of houses facing defiantly at the sea all added to the experience.  Cockenzie is a place where the tiny threads of personal memories entwine with ancient stories and history of fishwives and fishermen, salt makers and coal miners, where the tracks of the past run literally at your feet. Yet there is still a vibrant local community, a living connection to the ancestral past. That makes the place extra special.  My thoughts were interrupted by a comment from a festival-goer: \u0026ldquoLook! That\u0026rsquos the sea, I mean the real sea, so cool. He and his friends left through the beach gate and headed down to the beach to take photos.  The comment made me realise something obvious. A real connection is the sea, and it also made me feel lucky that I live next to it.  It was on the Saturday night that the sea brought me new thoughts. The blue sky turned grey, then a dark, brooding black. The calm water began to boil with rage as it brought warm air from the south which had turned into a storm. We managed to get into our tent just in time.  Howling winds and torrential rain swept through the festival campsite like a reaper, ripping up tents. I double-pegged our tent with the help of my friend Chris Yule, and then we huddled inside as the winds did their worst. The kids were both excited and a little scared by it, but mostly excited!  The family slept as the storm howled in anger outside, the canvas walls of the tent bending this way and that. If we needed to evacuate, Chris had kindly offered the floor of his caravan as a refuge.  I lay there listening to the storm and was glad I was not at sea. My home town, Prestonpans, was born of such a storm when a pirate, possibly a Viking, was shipwrecked on the shoreline a thousand years ago. He stayed and founded the village, his name still echoed in Aldhammer House.  I stayed awake until the worst was over, then fell into sleep. In the morning, birds were singing and the sun shining. The campsite looked like a battlefield site collapsed tents and stuff blown everywhere, including a small tent blown into the hedge by us. But the festival site was repaired and a great final day had.  We took the longer, scenic route home, via Argyll\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquosecret coast\u0026rsquo, a deeply wooded and beautifully quiet part of the West Coast.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to be home, said my four-year-old as we arrived. It was, not least to have a shower and to eat something that wasn\u0026rsquot from a tin!  \u0026ldquoCan we go for a walk by the sea? I was asked first thing this morning.  \u0026ldquoAfter I have written my story, I replied.  \u0026ldquoWhat are you going to write about this time?  \u0026ldquoNot sure, let\u0026rsquos see what comes to my mind, I said.  And so now we will head to the Boat Shore, and the walk by the coast there.  I love living by the sea."},{"url":null,"title":"day-centre-welcomes-zambian-visitors","story":"  The centre received a visit from the country\u0026rsquos social welfare minister Emerine Kabanshi and Julien Mwape, director general of Zambia Agency for People with Disabilities (ZAPD), who are in Scotland to see firsthand a range of health and social care facilities.

Jane was inspired to take on the run by Eliza McKinney, a girl from North Berwick who has Rett Syndrome and whose family have taken on a number of fundraisers to help find a cure.  Jane said that the seven-year-old was \u0026ldquoamazingly brave and, on her JustGiving page, added: \u0026ldquoShe is part of the reason I started running \u0026ndash her bravery, determination and smile inspired me to try and do something to help find a way to help children with this incredibly debilitating, life-altering condition.  Jane told the Courier she was pleased that the money raised was going towards \u0026ldquogroundbreaking work to find a cure for the condition, which mainly affects young girls.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"catriona-matthew-brings-solheim-cup-to-north-berwick","story":"  Matthew will captain the European team for the event \u0026ndash the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup \u0026ndash and was in her home town on Monday to start the countdown.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8195899.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=128\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe new housing is phased, which enables us to plan ahead.  \u0026ldquoAt the moment we are still looking at a range of options.  \u0026ldquoOf course, the focus on greater multi-disciplinary working coming in now with the new GP contract will allow patients much greater flexibility and swifter access to the right clinical professional at surgeries and other local settings.  Provost John McMillan, a councillor for Haddington and Lammermuir ward, said planning the development of any future health facility had to be carefully weighed up.  Mr McMillan also noted the variety of services which would be included within the new \u0026pound70 million hospital.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is the same issues around working with a town that has got a good town square and you need to look at car parking.  \u0026ldquoWe are looking at that in a measured way and working in partnership.  \u0026ldquoIt is the same with families with young children coming in and an ageing population.  \u0026ldquoYou have to look at schools and the health service as well."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8207400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"pear-tree-nursery-set-to-create-up-to-30-jobs-in-haddington","story":"  Pear Tree Nursery has opened a second facility in the town in a former bed and breakfast on West Road.  The new nursery, which saw more than 200 interested parents attend its open day last month, could employ up to 30 staff when it is at capacity, with six already recruited.  Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe wanted a second site because of the waiting list we had at Meadowpark and were delighted to be able to take on the former B\u0026ampB on West Road.  \u0026ldquoOur open day showed how much nursery places are in demand and with all the new houses being built we knew there was a need for it.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have a second nursery in Haddington.  The new nursery, which features a giant indoor sandpit and separate baby unit with a sensory room and quiet areas, was officially opened by East Lothian MSP Iain Gray on Thursday, July 26.  He said: \u0026ldquoPear Tree Nursery has been doing a great job for many Haddington families in recent years \u0026ndash including my own grandsons. I have seen for myself on lots of occasions the great atmosphere in the existing nursery, and have watched that reflected in the many national awards Pear Tree has won for the quality of their provision.  \u0026ldquoI was delighted to help open the new Pear Tree on West Road. This is a beautiful building and it has been fitted out to provide the best of care. Not only will it increase the availability of childcare, but it will create a significant number of new jobs in the town too.  \u0026ldquoThis is now a highly qualified and professional sector, and Pear Tree has a great track record on staff support and training, so these are excellent opportunities for local people.  \u0026ldquoWith childcare entitlement expanding and Haddington also increasing in size, this is a much-needed and welcome facility."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.  To the east, it comes into force as drivers make their way along the A1087."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4108040.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=12\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"your-chance-to-apply-for-thousands-of-pounds-of-support-for-your-charity","story":"  Last year, donations totalling almost \u0026pound300,000 were made up and down the country on behalf of Newsquest Media Group, one of the UK\u0027s largest publishers and owners of the East Lothian Courier.

In the meantime the campaigners say that the SFA should withdraw from the international matches.  The SPSC said in its petition: \"While the state of Israel continues to violate Palestinian rights with impunity...\u0026nbspthe SFA could make a significant contribution toward the goal of freedom for the Palestinian people and equal rights for all in Israel/Palestine.\"    But the SFA has said it has no plans to comply while the Israeli Embassy in London has said allegations made about Israel\u0027s actions were \"hate-laden\".

They will urge the First Minister to \u0026ldquouse the mandate she sought and which, by her own benchmark, she secured at the general election for a new vote on the constitution.  Ms Sturgeon said last year that if the SNP won a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster it would convert her already \u0026ldquocast-iron mandate for a referendum into a \u0026ldquotriple lock one.

However the First Minister \u0026ldquoreset her plans after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election, and is due to update Holyrood on her new timetable in October.  Senior SNP figures such as MP Pete Wishart and MSP Alex Neil have urged caution, downplaying the prospect of another plebiscite in the near future.

Given the Tories\u0026rsquo shambolic mishandling of things, the terms of Brexit are currently far from clear \u0026ndash but it is positive to see people from across the country continue to campaign passionately for independence.  Scotland Land of the Brave Saor Alba did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"universal-basic-income-is-attempt-to-euthanise-the-working-class-as-a-concept","story":"  Tom Kibasi, director of the left-wing Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), insisted the scheme was to the UK\u0027s economic problems \"what snake oil is to medicine\".  He argued it would mean \"getting into bed with the billionaires\" by letting capitalism off the hook and entrenching power inequalities.  It comes after Nicola Sturgeon pledged to fund research into a universal basic income (UBI) last year, with \u0026pound250,000 set aside for potential pilots in four council areas. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also said pilots could be included in the next Labour manifesto.  Mr Kibasi was debating the issue at the Edinburgh International Book Festival with economist and basic income campaigner Annie Miller and economist and journalist Stewart Lansley.  Ms Miller, co-founder of Citizen\u0026rsquos Basic Income Network Scotland, suggested every adult could be paid \u0026pound162 a week. This would be funded by hiking income tax to at least 45%.  The IPPR previously said such a scheme would cost \u0026pound20 billion a year in Scotland and would risk making child poverty worse.  Agreeing the economy is in crisis and in need of fundamental reform, Mr Kibasi said a basic income was seductive \"precisely because it\u0027s a big idea, but the problem is that big ideas aren\u0027t necessarily good ideas\".  He added: \"My real objection to UBI is that it lets capitalism off the hook. It is giving in, it is embracing defeat.\"  He said the policy was widely supported by Silicon Valley tycoons such as Elon Musk, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg \u0026ndash as well as Richard Branson.  He continued: \"In politics you always get strange bedfellows \u0026ndash that\u0027s absolutely the case. But if you\u0027re going to get into bed with the billionaires, you\u0027ve got to ask yourself, \u0027Why are they in favour of it?\u0027  \"The reason is that UBI actually maintains unequal power relations.\"  He said introducing a basic income risked leaving 20 or 30 per cent of the population as a \u0026ldquodependent class, and insisted it was \u0026ldquotrying to attempt a form of kind of euthanasia for the working class as a political category and a political concept.  Dismissing the idea as \u0026ldquomagical thinking, he argued money should instead be spent on building good homes, boosting the budget of the NHS or improving schools.  He also insisted UBI would \"solidify and reinforce\" gender inequality, because women would come under pressure to stay at home and look after their children.  He added: \"UBI is to our economic problems what snake oil is to medicine.\"  Glasgow, Edinburgh, Fife and North Ayrshire councils are all considering basic income pilots.  They will be ready to begin their trials in March 2020 \u0026ndash subject to a final decision on whether or not the proposals are feasible.  Supporters deny the scheme is being held up as a \"silver bullet\" that will solve all of society\u0027s problems.  Ms Miller said UBI would help \"emancipate\" people and prevent poverty, and branded the current social security system \u0026ldquovery cruel.  But she said it would need to be introduced gradually to prevent disruption and allow the system to settle in.  She said UBI would live up to the four words engraved on the mace in the Scottish Parliament: justice, integrity, compassion and wisdom.  \"I can\u0027t think of a better foundation for a society than a basic income, bringing about some of these changes that I hope will happen,\" she added.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe are interested in any proposals to help reduce poverty and inequality.  \"We have awarded \u0026pound250,000 over the next two years to four local authorities developing work that seeks to better understand the impact of a citizen\u0026rsquos basic income \u0026ndash including costs, benefits and savings."},{"url":null,"title":"childrens-hearings-scotlands-dehumanising-recruitment-posters-slammed","story":"  Children\u0027s Hearings Scotland launched the campaign to recruit new panel members today, but experts say the adverts are misjudged and should be withdrawn.  The posters, which are part of a drive to recruit younger people to sit on Scotland\u0027s lay tribunals assessing the needs of vulnerable children, show a bus driver, a catering manager, a leisure worker and a customer adviser with halos over their heads.  They also describe scenarios where the people pictured have helped a young person. One reads: \"I helped protect mummy\u0027s little punchbag from another beating\".  Critics include the heads of some of Scotland\u0027s major children\u0027s charities. Mary Glasgow, interrim head of Children 1st tweeted that she was \"stunned\" at the adverts\u0027 depiction of panel members as saints, adding: \"We need sensitive, informed panel members who understand it\u0026rsquos not about heroics or power but rather support, understanding and decisions made in the best interests of children and alongside parents whenever possible.\"  Sally Ann Kelly, chief executive of Aberlour tweeted of the poster with the \u0027mummy\u0027s little punchbag\u0027 line: \"Surely you need to reconsider this advert @chscotland?\"      Surely you need to reconsider this advert @CHScotland? pic.twitter/7YAjDOvnOi  Meanwhile, several board members and spokespeople at Who Cares? Scotland, the charity for care experienced young people, also voiced their dismay.  Kenny Murray said the adverts were \"dehumanising\" and misrepresented the problems faced by many young people attending children\u0027s hearings.  \"These adverts place societal stigma and judgement against parents who somehow find their family life in front of a children\u0026rsquos panel. When you come in front of a panel it might be because of abuse or neglect. It might not be. When the wording places such emphasis on abuse, what it doesn\u0026rsquot do is place the wellbeing of the child at the centre,\" he said, in a blog.      i was one of the people they consulted on the design of the posters for this campaign and i highly suggested they changed mostly everything from the wording to even the colour scheming. it\u0026rsquos a shame that they didn\u0026rsquot, but hopefully they\u0026rsquoll retract them.  He said the recruitment campaign would add to the stigma attached to young people in care, and might attract the wrong people. \"If your advertising seeks to motivate someone through using a halo and very carefully selected narratives in which you place the viewer as a vigilante or a rescuer, who then does that motivate?\"  Jamie Kinlochan tweeted: \"Folk who want a halo are the folk young people don\u0027t need.\"  Meanwhile Who Cares? Scotland board member Alicia Santana said young people\u0027s views of the posters had been ignored.  \"I was one of the people they consulted on the design of the posters for this campaign and I highly suggested they changed mostly everything from the wording to even the colour scheming.

It can be time consuming, and a certain resilience is required, it is a different type of volunteering, he said.  \u0026ldquoIn the past we\u0026rsquove learned that if you don\u0026rsquot send out a strong message, we can recruit people but have a high drop off rate when people find out what is actually involved.  Mr McAdam said the posters were only one element of a wider campaign which will stress the importance of the decisions panels can make and panel members as a force for good in their local community.      The campaign launched by @CHSscotland to recruit new panel members has generated debate. We knew this would be the case and tested and researched including with young people. My blog https://t.co/94OyPIvgoe sets out our aims.  He defended\u0026nbsp the \u0026lsquohalo\u0026rsquo motif in the adverts, adding: \u0026ldquoWe are not saying panel members are angels by any manner of means . But people do regularly praise the work panel members do. We want to get people to recognise this is a way that they can contribute and make a difference, he said.  The adverts also aim to attract younger volunteers, he said, with the average age of a panel member being 53. \u0026ldquoYoung people and those who work with them have told us for a number of years that they want to see panel members\u0026nbsp closer in age to them. We need more young people involved.  Duncan Dunlop, chief executive of Who Cares?

But now one of Scotland\u0027s ancient seats of learning has launched evening classes in a language many of its scholars have derided: north-east Scots.  Aberdeen University\u0027s Elphinstone Institute has devised 10-week workshops in Doric, to help both locals and newcomers to the region learn to speak - and more importantly - write in the mither leid.  The Institute\u0027s Alistair Heather said: \u0026ldquoRecent figures show that the Scots language - which includes Doric - is spoken by around half of the entire population of the north-east and used by 1.5 million people across Scotland.  \"As the largest minority language in Europe, Scots is experiencing a real boost with so many new works and new translations into the tongue.  \"Whilst north-east Scots can be heard throughout the region, and can often been seen in signage or adverts, people seldom get the chance to learn it as a written language.\"  Mr Heather writes in north-east Scots himself including features for The Herald and a column for our sister paper The National. But he is still encountering some readers - including fluent or regular speakers of Scots - who find it strange to see what is normally a spoken dialect written down.  The workshops, which begin in September, are not just aimed to help people find ways to put their language down on paper. Mr Heather said the courses would also help speakers improve their fluency and range of expression and learn a little about history.  BACKGROUND: How Scots-speaking areas voted No  He said: \"The workshops will focus on how people can use the language in their daily lives, and by the end of the first block of workshops they will have sent a tweet, made a Facebook post, some verse and even a letter to the press in north-east Scots!  \"It will also invite newer arrivals to Scotland and the north-east to take a chance to learn and understand the speech and literary traditions of their new hame. Language can be the key to unlock the culture of the north-east and to help new arrivals settle in to the area.\"  Social media has thrust all the dialects of Scots in to the public sphere with people tweeting or Facebooking as they speak, rather than as they were taught to write at school. However, there is a large corpus of historic and modern literature in the language which can be studied too.  North-east Scots is routinely referred to as Doric - even by its speakers - despite the term\u0027s derogatory background.    Alistair Heather  Until last century all Scots dialects, including those of the central belt, and Northumbrian were called Doric in what was thought to be a joking reference to an ancient Greek language.  Athenians - or Attics - considered the speech or Dorians, Doric, to be rougher than their refined dialect.  Several parts of the North-East have the among the highest prevalence of Scots speakers, with 49 per cent of the population of Aberdeenshire saying they know the language. Knowledge of Scots falls in Edinburgh. The last census showed more than 311,000 of its 460,000 inhabitants of the Athens of the North could not understand, speak, read or write in Doric or any other Scots dialect.

Isolated from each other, but connected with a communications network, the monitoring posts were built as an insurance policy against a day it was hoped would never come.  But as the threat of an atomic exchange receded, they fell into disuse and were abandoned as relics of a darker time, with few remaining intact today.  Yet now the secrets of one of the last nuclear monitoring post\u0026rsquos left in Scotland are to be revealed for the first time in more than 20 years through a project being undertaken to uncover the lost history of a remote part of the North East.    Little can be seen of the bunker above ground  At first glance, the fields of Inverharroch Farm on the Cabrach are an unlikely place for a stronghold from the height of the Cold War.  But it was from here that a three-man squad would watch mushroom clouds spreading from the ruins of Aberdeen, Dundee and other population centres if ther Soviets had ever launched their missiles.  There used to be ROC monitoring posts every 10-15 miles, with the Cabrach, which has been closed since 1992, site neighbouring those in Findhorn and Elgin.  George Anthony from Keith was a former group officer for the ROC and worked at the Drummuir site. He explained what the organisation was tasked to do.  He said: \"Ten thousand observers were part of the Royal Observer Corps around the country and I started out as an observer at a monitoring post in Drummuir. When I was promoted to group officer I looked after four posts in Moray.  \"If we came under attack, our job was to plot the flash going off and the pressure of the nuclear burst.  \"Even in peacetime we had to take readings from instruments every five to 10 minutes so each shift was very busy.  He added: \"There was no heating, though, and the only air was via a small vent and the access shaft, so you had to be hardy.\"    Access is provided through a deep shaft  Sunk 20 feet under the ground, the reinforced concrete bunkers were designed to survive an atomic blast, with access provided by a single ladder descending from a turf-covered steel manhole on the surface.  Inside, there was enough space for three servicemen to live for a period of up to three weeks after a nuclear attack, although conditions were cramped.  Each bunker comprised only a single room, with mapping and monitoring equipment crammed into the living space, along with an adjacent chemical toilet.  From here, the ROC officers would trace the shifting patterns of deadly radioactive fallout blowing on the wind and relay the information to larger underground centres, such as the Troywood bunker in Fife \u0026ndash a 24,000 sq ft facility now open as The Secret Bunker tourist attraction.    Conditions inside were cramped  Andy Fairgrieve from Dufftown, who also manages the arts programme of a nearby Speyside distillery, has visited more than 200 decommissioned nuclear bunkers around Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf you were on duty when the bombs dropped then you had to stay in the bunker. The data you provided would have helped the government to establish the effects on the country and to help any survivors.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe nuclear posts were located around 10 to 15 miles apart and were organised into clusters which communicated between themselves.  \u0026ldquoThe Cabrach bunker, or \u0026lsquoPost 32\u0026rsquo, was part of the Aberdeen Section. The UK\u0026rsquos network of bunkers were reorganised from 1968 onwards, with a number of them being closed down, although Post 32 remained operational until the early 1990\u0026rsquos when the Royal Observer Corps was stood down.  \u0026ldquoMost are now flooded, burned out or permanently locked by the landowner but this one remains in remarkably good condition and I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to showing people around it.  The bunker, which will be opened for one day on Saturday 18 August, is under the care of the Cabrach Trust, which plans to work with historians to convert the existing farm steading into a historically-accurate distillery, heritage centre and cafe as a significant new tourist attraction. All profits will be reinvested locally in jobs, housing and infrastructure.  \u0026ldquoHeritage isn\u0026rsquot just all about ancient history, said the Executive Director of The Cabrach Trust, Sue Savege.  \u0026ldquoThe nuclear bunker is part of the Cabrach\u0026rsquos very recent history and is a fascinating chapter in of the area\u0026rsquos long and interesting heritage. The story behind this bunker will eventually be documented alongside the rest of the history of the Cabrach in our new heritage centre.  \"The Open Day will give us an opportunity to give an update on how work is progressing on the heritage centre, and we\u0026rsquoll be offering a \u0026lsquovirtual tour\u0026rsquo of the site."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8251269.jpg?type=article-full","title":"fans-take-high-road-for-last-runrig-gigs","story":"  Tens of thousands of fans are this weekend making one last pilgrimage to hear Runrig play Loch Lomond. For they and their true loves - as the band\u0026rsquos floorfilling cover nearly goes - will never meet again.  The six-piece has sold 47,000 tickets for farewell concerts in Stirling today and tomorrow that will bring down the curtain on 45 years of their groundbreaking brand of Celtic folk rock.  Their fans - many in the Hebrides - have struggled to afford or arrange the journey with Calmac warning ferries were full and extra flights from the islands put on to cater for extra demand.  Against a backdrop of Stirling Castle, Runrig will perform, for just two last times, what amounts soundtrack of the last few turbulent decades of Scottish history, through two devolution referendums and 2014\u0026rsquos big vote.  The group - despite some changed faces - says it has a special bond with its fans, many of whom were enjoying rock in their own language for the first time. But the time, the musicians said, had come to bow out.  Vocalist Bruce Guthro said: \u0026ldquoI think we\u0026rsquore ready. I think we\u0026rsquore very proud of what we\u0026rsquove accomplished and we\u0026rsquore ready to give Scotland the show of a lifetime.  The Canadian, who has been touring with Runrig for 20 years, said of his time with the group: \u0026ldquoAll of it has been special. It\u0026rsquos almost impossible to pick certain highlights - it\u0026rsquos just been a great journey.  \u0026ldquoThe fans are are a family unto themselves and they are without question the driving force behind this band.  Since forming on Skye in 1973, Runrig have produced 14 studio albums and performed at Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Albert Hall and in New York\u0026rsquos Times Square.  They are hailed for their contribution to Scottish music, the Gaelic language and Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural identity. Though they were never entirely happy to be seen as a kitsch symbol of Scottishness.    Founding member Rory MacDonald said it is a love of performing that has kept the group going through the decades.  The bass player said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tended just to go from album to album, we\u0026rsquove never had a grand plan, or the idea we\u0026rsquore going to take over the world - none of that stuff.  \u0026ldquoVery early on, maybe after the third album, we knew very much that this was what we wanted to do with our lives. It wasn\u0026rsquot for fame or fortune, it was just that we loved playing music and playing together.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove always had that sense of being comfortable with what we\u0026rsquore doing. That\u0026rsquos the way it has worked for us.  Guitarist Malcolm Jones added: \u0026ldquoIf you\u0026rsquod said then that 45 years later we\u0026rsquod still be doing this, you\u0026rsquod have thought no way, not a chance.  Jones said concerts - called Last Dance - marked the end of an era for the band but other projects would continue, including looking after the group\u0026rsquos legacy.  Keyboard player Brian Hurren admitted there has been nerves ahead of the final concerts.  He said: \u0026ldquoI would say it\u0026rsquos unlike any other show I\u0026rsquove experienced with the band. I\u0026rsquove had sleepless nights and I\u0026rsquove had elation and excitement, sadness - everything. It\u0026rsquos been an incredible journey.  \u0026ldquoThere are a lot of fans that can\u0026rsquot get to see us because they\u0026rsquore in Australia or places that are just too far away, but they have been trying to make it over for this show, which is amazing.  Meeting the band ahead of the concerts, Scotland\u0026rsquos Deputy First Minister John Swinney thanked Runrig for their \u0026ldquoextraordinary contribution to Scotland\u0026rsquos cultural life.  He tweeted: \u0026ldquoA very special privilege to thank Runrig1973 on behalf of Scottish Government for all they have done to strengthen Scottish traditional music, the Gaelic language and Scotland in 45 years of amazing music.  \u0026ldquoThey have been such an important part of Scotland\u0026rsquos incredible journey.    Mr Swinney\u0026rsquos SNP colleague Pete Wishart MP formerly played keyboards for the band. Mr Wishart had said he would never join the SNP when interviewed in 1991.  Speaking to writer Peter Ross in last weekend\u0026rsquos Herald Magazine, Mr Wishart stressed his band\u0026rsquos part in helping Scotland learning to love and appreciate a sense of itself as confident and assertive. He added: \u0026ldquoAll the other political changes could never have happened without a feeling that what we have in Scotland is important and worth celebrating.  The band did not write Loch Lomond. But the traditional song\u0026rsquos lyrics may offer some consolation. \u0026ldquoThe broken heart it kens nae second spring again, it goes. \u0026ldquoThough the waeful may cease frae their grieving."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-and-parents-sound-off-to-swinney-on-education-policy","story":"  Marie, a mother of twins, contacted a live radio phone-in with Mr Swinney to raise the treatment of her disabled daughter at school.  Now educating her children at home, Marie told the minister her daughter was given little or no help despite being unable to get dressed or go to the toilet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWhen there was no learning assistant about her class teacher asked her twin to take her to the toilet. Obviously at 10-years-old \u0026hellip both of them were very upset.  \u0026ldquoShe was left in the changing room, the teacher never got her changed, her twin had to do that, then got in trouble for taking too long.  \u0026ldquoIf she approached a supply teacher to ask for help they would say a child of her age should be able to get dressed herself.  Mr Swinney said her experiences were \u0026ldquototally unacceptable and pledged to look into the situation.  \u0026ldquoIndividual local authorities have got to make the assessment of how to fulfil the needs of individual children, but what you\u0026rsquove recounted to me is very clearly not acceptable, he said.  It was one of a number of difficult calls Mr Swinney fielded during his hour-long appearance on BBC Scotland\u0026rsquos Kaye Adams Show, hosted by Stephen Jardine.  Mr Swinney conceded it had been a challenging time in Scottish education and it was clear the parents, grandparents and teachers who phoned in from across the country shared that view.  Lesley, from the Scottish Borders, said pupils were being placed under too much exam pressure and were not taught properly.  She said her granddaughters had sat exams with questions that had not been covered by their school.  Mr Swinney stressed the importance of pupils being supported and said they should be fully taught courses.  \u0026ldquoBut they\u0026rsquore not, came the frustrated reply. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot think the system is working and it is punishing children very badly. It is robbing them of their confidence.  Susan, a primary school teacher and headteacher for 39 years, accused Mr Swinney of failing to address workload pressures and teacher shortages.  She said the profession was \u0026ldquohaemorrhaging teachers because morale was \u0026ldquoso low, telling Mr Swinney: \u0026ldquoYou have a real crisis with recruitment and retention.  \u0026ldquoA number of my friends started out as teachers at the same time I did and out of all of those talented committed individuals I was the only one that lasted until 60.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot hear anything there that you have said this morning that would convince me that you have got a handle on this.  Another listener from North Lanarkshire texted to say her secondary school had been short of a chemistry teacher for five years.  Mr Swinney said he accepted teaching was demanding, but said he had engaged with teachers to reduce their workload.  He added: \u0026ldquoWhat we have got us a very challenging period in education. We have some staff shortages, he said.  Predictably, Mr Swinney was also put under pressure on primary school testing.  The Education Secretary said the assessments would help teachers identify issues as pupils progressed, but there was strong opposition.  Tommy, a teacher from the Highlands, said the tests jarred with current classroom practice.  \u0026ldquoThe requirement for recording assessments in primary school is bordering on the ridiculous. It\u0026rsquos another thing added to the list.  And Stuart, who starts a primary school teaching qualification on Monday, said he had \u0026ldquoreal worries arguing the tests were \u0026ldquonot needed and not wanted."},{"url":null,"title":"annie-lennox-offers-respect-to-queen-of-soul-aretha-franklin","story":"  Aretha Franklin\u0026rsquos uniquely rich and soaring voice was integral to the chart-topping success of Sisters Are Doin\u0026rsquo It For Themselves, the 1985 classic she sang with Annie Lennox.

Describing the singer as \u0026ldquosimply peerless, Lennox said: \u0026ldquoShe has reigned supreme, and will always be held in the highest firmament of stars as the most exceptional vocalist, performer and recording artist the world has ever been privileged to witness.  \u0026ldquoSuperlatives are often used to describe astonishing singers \u0026ndash but in my view, even superlatives cannot be sufficient.  \u0026ldquoEveryone who loved her will be saying little prayers of gratitude, respect and appreciation for the musical life force that enriched our lives.

I was fortunate enough to spend time with her and witness her last performance \u0026ndash a benefit for the Elton John Aids Foundation at St John The Divine Cathedral.  \u0026ldquoShe was obviously unwell, and I wasn\u0026rsquot sure she could perform. But Aretha did and she raised the roof. She sang and played magnificently, and we all wept. We were witnessing the greatest soul artist of all time. I adored her and worshipped her talent. God bless her.  Beatles star Sir Paul McCartney asked for fans to take a moment to \u0026ldquogive thanks to the beautiful life of Aretha Franklin, the queen of our souls, who inspired us.

It comes amid complaints of an Edinburgh Tattoo performance being disturbed by the nearby Rag\u0026lsquoN\u0026rsquo Bone Man gig in Princes Street Gardens.  Controversy erupted last week over blackboards that prevent the public seeing ticketed concerts in the gardens, which could host up to 200 events a year when a new \u0026pound25 million arena is completed.  The association accused council chiefs of trying to commercialise \u0026ldquoevery square metre of the city centre.  Only the festival fireworks finale would be allowed in the gardens under the Cockburn\u0026rsquos vision for the beauty spot.  Chairman Cliff Hague said: \u0026ldquoLike many others, my concerns have grown, as it seems like every square metre of the city centre is being viewed as a means of raising revenue. This also links disruption such events cause before, during and after the event itself.  \u0026ldquoI have no problems with the fireworks at the end of the festival, which depend on the setting of the castle to add to the spectacle.  \u0026ldquoBut I am less convinced by the necessity to stage major pop and rock concerts.

It comes as a music festival was told to take down a massive black-out fence blighting the city centre.  The organisers of the Summer Sessions erected the high barrier around the perimeter of Princes Street Gardens to prevent a view of concerts at the Ross Bandstand.

Some eight years and \u0026#65533120,000 later, that goal has now been achieved.      \t                                                             The independence celebrations will be marked here in Scotland by Polish people across the country.                                                    And taking centre stage will be the Great Polish Map of Scotland.        In the summers of 1974 to 1979, this lasting legacy was created in the Borders to celebrate the links between Scotland and Poland.Although dating back to before 1576, it was in that year Royal Grants first recorded the relationship – with the King of Poland protecting the Scots “who supply us with all that is necessary”. Our friendship has remained firm ever since.The Great Polish Map of Scotland was mainly the work of a small group of Poles from the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, led by the map’s lead designer, Dr. Kazimierz Trafas.                                                                                                        But its creation was the brainchild of Krakow-born Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st (Polish) Armoured Division, who was stationed in Galashiels during the war and married a Scottish nurse in 1942 after being treated in the town’s Peel Hospital.He became a successful hotelier in Edinburgh after the war and added Barony Castle in Eddleston to his properties in 1968, where the map was conceived and created.He wanted to show hotel guests the landscape of Scotland and hoped the map would become a tourist magnet.Jan also wanted to show the coastline of the country Polish forces had been responsible for defending.                                                                                                        He is remembered as saying to hotel patrons: “I shall die but I shall leave my map as a gift to the Scottish people to thank them for the hospitality they showed the Poles when it was needed”.After the hotel closed in 1985 and ownership of Barony Castle passed from the Tomasik family, the map fell gradually into disrepair.But in 2010, Mapa Scotland was formed – a group of volunteers who were dedicated to restoring the map to its former gloryThanks to grants from the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Fund, along with fundraising, that goal has now been achieved.And it is hoped it will become both a visitor attraction and an educational resource for many generations to come.                                                                                                        With that in mind, a digital documentation team from Historic Environment Scotland spent five days on site, laser scanning the map to create a 3D model.The team then spent several months, working with Mapa Scotland and the Polish Cultural Festival Association, to create an interactive app highlighting Scotland’s Polish heritage.For Marta Pilarska, digital documentation intern with HES, the project proved to be a learning curve.She said: “I’m Polish and even I was discovering new connections between Poland and Scotland which I had never heard before. “It was a really interesting project to be involved with.“I knew the basics – the soldiers during the war years and that Bonnie Prince Charlie’s mother was Polish.“But I never knew that 40,000 Scots emigrated to Poland in the 1600s and that many towns and areas are still named after Scotland.“One of the quirkier facts we discovered was that a Polish folk dance, dating back to the 1600s, is actually based on a ceilidh dance.“I had no idea about any of that until this project.”Marta joined the HES team at an ideal time too – just one month before work started on the project.She added: “I was in the perfect place at the perfect time – a nice coincidence.“We hope people will enjoy finding out more about the two countries links and that teachers will also visit the map and use the digital app as a learning tool.”The Great Polish Map of Scotland measures some 50 metres by 40 metres and lies in an oval pit surrounded by a 142 metres long perimeter wall. Covering an area of 1590 square metres, it is understood to be the largest three-dimensional physical representation of a country and the largest outdoor relief map in the world.Visit https://sketchfab/HistoricEnvironment Scotland to explore the app.A labour of love for MAPA Scotland volunteers who restored landmarkA business meeting at Barony Castle Hotel in 1996 led Keith Burns to stumble across the Great Polish Map of Scotland, literally – it was so overgrown.But it wasn’t until 1999, when the engineer from East Linton retired, that the discovery started “nagging away” at him.In 2000, Keith and several friends started discussing what they could do to transform the landmark’s fortunes.And in 2010 they formed the charity MAPA Scotland, with the aim of raising enough funds to restore the map.Initially, they thought it would take two years and around £45,000 to rectify – but it proved a much larger undertaking.Keith, who was the project manager, explained: “We seriously understimated how long the work would take and how much it would all cost.“There were two reasons for that: firstly, we didn’t realise how much repair work the foundations of the map would require. They had been built with old tin cans from the hotel and they were crumbling away.“And secondly we had to get one or two specialist contractors to repair the pit wall and relay a lot of underground water supply pipes for the seabed.“The water supply had never worked it now does so we’ve actually upgraded the map.“But all of that took money and, to date, it has cost in excess of £120,000 to restore.”That funding was raised thanks to the Heritage Lottery and European Leader Funds, as well as major contributions from the Barony Castle Hotel, Borders Council, the Polish Consulate and the Scottish Polish Cultural Association, as well as generous public donations.However, 12 MAPA volunteers bore the brunt of the labour.Keith added: “We were all retired and could spend time on the project. It was hard work and involved a fair bit of travel but we’re delighted the map has now finally been restored.”Collection boxes around the site will help MAPA maintain the map for future generations.

When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Friday 17 Aug 2018 7:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds. If the hotels were confident in their product they would have nothing to fear from a budget hotel chain, wrote Facebook user Anne Grain.Thrumster House B\u0026ampB owner Catherine Mary MacLeod stressed that local businesses would be hit as the new hotel would have its own suppliers.\u0026ldquoSmall restaurants will be affected and profits from the business will go out of the county... It won\u0026rsquot affect me, but it will affect Thurso, she wrote.As some have underlined, however, such objections amount to very little unless they are submitted directly to the planning department website.On Friday, the council spokesman stressed that all comments filed as both documents and as website comments will be taken into considerationWhitbread, which owns Premier Inn, has applied for permission to build a three-storey, 81-bedroom hotel with restaurant and bar, associated car parking, pedestrian access and landscaping.If approved, the hotel would be built at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Friday 17 Aug 2018 7:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116895.jpg","title":"Gala furore over Lidl Wayne absolutely ridiculous","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMany people took to social media to voice their anger and concern at the reaction and coverage in the national and regional press following the appearance of the character on Saturday night.Around 90 per cent of the responses were positive and supportive.

This will also improve the availability of recycled material for use in the production of bottles and cans in future.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to provide their views on how this scheme can meet Scotland’s needs and help us tackle our throwaway culture.”Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “Scotland’s planned deposit return scheme is a landmark in the nation’s circular economy journey, with the potential to drive inward investment and create jobs in Scotland at the same time as improving recycling and reducing litter.\u0026#8221Consultation available to view.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They were both originally earmarked for closure, but were later given temporary reprieves to see if customer numbers increase.The new report also warned that while \"online banking, Post Office banking and mobile bank vans go some way to providing alternatives\", there were concerns over cyber security, \"the fragile nature of Post Office contracts\", and accessibility of mobile banks.Zoe Laird, HIE\u0026rsquos regional head of communities infrastructure, said: \"Along with the findings of the Scottish Parliament Enquiry into bank closures this [study] will inform how public sector agencies and service providers respond.\"Friday 17 Aug 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Even non-dog owners have praised our initiative.\"She added: \"This is a disappointing thing to happen in our village where so many volunteers do their best to maintain the area to ensure this is a clean and safe place for residents and visitors and I am appalled that this vandalism was apparently carried out by a local resident.\"The community council and Men\u0026rsquos Shed group were put in touch via link man Roddie McPherson, who lives near the fishing village\u0026rsquos landmark harbour.The eco-friendly wooden dispensers can be found at the Avoch end of the railway line path, on Shore Walk by the industrial units, at the harbour green and at the start of the Shaltie Burn path.The move follows a recent initiative in the village to highlight the many paths which can be enjoyed by visitors to the village via a panel erected at a prominent spot near the Lazy Corner.A police spokesman said: \"Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101, quoting NE5003/18, or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.\"Friday 17 Aug 2018 7:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added.

I said you can\u0026rsquot do that \u0026ndash no one has been notified about this. The guys just said they were acting on instructions.\"Hamish Mackenzie of Tarbat Community Council wrote to Highland Council chief executive Steve Barron back in June after receiving apologies in January from local authority community services staff for the lack of warning.They said the equipment was removed on health and safety grounds \u0026ndash a reason given in other similar instances across the region.However Mr Mackenzie says follow-up enquiries for details about land ownership and the legalities of the situation have not been responded to months later.\"The first choice is to get Highland Council to continue to maintain the park in accordance with the original agreement. People certainly feel short-changed by the council.\"People are also aware of things like threats to toilet provision and grass not being mowed. We seem to have an endless series of services being cut, often without any notice.\"He added: \"I understand budget pressures but we will fight when things are taken away without any warning, particularly when we see no justification for it.\"He said the developer of the Knockshortie Estate, Micky Austin was \"staggered\" to learn of the latest development having paid \u0026pound18,000 towards the cost of the playpark, which he had assumed would continue to be maintained and available to locals. He said: \"He is a public spirited person and has developed a nice estate. A play park lets children to get outside and away from gadgets and devices. It\u0026rsquos a great tragedy.\"\u0026nbspQuestion marks though remain for the community over the legality of the move. Many on the estate feel cheated that a facility which helped attract them in the first place has been stripped away \u0026ndash while others say Highland Council has \"played the health and safety card\" without justification.\u0026nbspThey are now left seeking answers and facing the prospect of potentially having to raise thousands to replace the facility.Tain and Easter Ross councillor Derek Loudon said: \"Highland Council officers have ordered a search of the Land Register and the Register of Sasines to clarify ownership. \"This will allow what is a very pro-active community to acquire or lease the land for a lottery or other funding bid. That is a prerequisite for any lottery bid. Let\u0026rsquos hope the community gets a quick turnaround and are able to buy the equipment needed and get it ready for next summer.\"Highland Council was approached for comment but had not responded as we went to press.Friday 17 Aug 2018 7:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Friday 17 Aug 2018 7:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

She said: \"All the neighbours were out watching. The road was like a volcano.\"She said: \"If they patch this now, it\u0026rsquoll only burst another six weeks down the line further down. It keeps bursting and they keep fixing it. It\u0026rsquos a nuisance and it\u0026rsquos been happening more and more often over the last few years.

We\u0026rsquore also a bit concerned about the asbestos in the pipe. There are also patches all the way down the road. One burst in May at 5am cut off half of Tain.\"Councillor Alasdair Rhind voiced frustration over the pace of the clean-up and wants Scottish Water to replace a substantive length of pipe to combat a repeat. He said: \"The most cost effective way would be to renew the pipe rather than having to call in squads of repairmen each time.\"A spokesman for Scottish Water apologised to customers affected and said the performance of mains is closely monitored \"to target investment where it is most needed, recognising that replacing water mains typically involves higher cost and further disruption for residents, whereas targeted repairs can often restore reliable service\".He said: \"Given the deteriorating performance of a section of the main serving customers in Knockbreck Avenue over recent months, this has now been identified as a priority and we will therefore be replacing the length of water main where bursts have occurred. We will keep residents informed once a proposed timescale for this work to take place has been identified in consultation with Highland Council.\"On health concerns, he said the water supply across Scotland is sampled, on average, once every two minutes and tested against strict quality standards to protect public health. Additional samples are routinely taken when a main is returned to service.He said the World Health Organisation has concluded there is no evidence of a health risk connected to drinking water from asbestos cement water mains.Friday 17 Aug 2018 7:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

For a start, with formal recognition in 2005, but usage stretching back to 1969, the Shetland flag was at the forefront of the modern local vexillological movement.                However, it is certainly true that since Caithness started its ­campaign for a flag in 2014 that more communities have followed suit every year. This is no doubt as a result of the benefits to those ­communities becoming more and more evident.             There are many reasons that a community may decide to develop a flag, with each community ­having its own unique circumstances. However in my experience there are three top-level types of benefit that communities who develop flags enjoy.            The first is perhaps the most ­readily apparent, the benefit around internal identity. A flag provides the community with a symbol that they can rally around and share, thus promoting their sense of togetherness. Obviously this is apparent during times of local celebration, much as the national flag is also used in such circumstances. However it is important to recognise that the positive power of flags extends to times of hardship as well. Barra is a notable example where in the aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack their flag was used very prominently on the island to express their sense of loss and ­solidarity. Secondly there is a notable ­benefit for communities regarding the external visibility a flag can bring for their area. In 2004, the then Scottish Executive found that the Saltire was the best symbol for ­promoting Scotland abroad, and for the same reason a flag can prove to be a strong and versatile brand for any sub-national community too.The well-established Shetland and Orkney flags are often seen on car stickers, badges and even on the packaging of other merchandise as well as actual flags. Every time the flags are used in this way they can act as a powerful branding for those areas. However, even younger flags have proved that they can achieve similar benefits – the Caithness flag appearing on the Wick Academy FC team strip, for example.Finally, there is an overall benefit to our sense of national identity too. Like a patchwork quilt the individual pieces need to be preserved and promoted to keep the whole fabric in good condition.             There are many places around the world that make good use of ­sub-national and national identities to complement each other. ­However, Scotland has one of the richest histories of celebrating not only national symbolism but those of its people and places too, and it is renowned for its love of ceremony. So much so that it is clear that Scotland’s sense of localism is core to its historic sense of national identity and understanding of itself.This can be seen in many of the unique aspects of Scottish culture and symbolism. Start with a type of symbol so associated with our country – tartan. The huge range of tartans is something that enhances our understanding of the country rather than undermining it. These cover places and communities, as well as tartans for individuals, families and clans.It is a feeling of belonging to one of our iconic names, families or clans that is another important part of historic Scottish identity. This has given rise to a distinctive character for heraldry in Scotland with unifying themes for particular surnames linking individuals’ personal arms in a display of unity. In Scottish ­heraldry itself there are many examples of historic emblems associated with not only clans but regions themselves. For instance the lymphad (galley) is emblematic of the islands and many of the families that hail from there. The Caithness galley even made its way onto their community flag. And there are many more from the Dundonian lilies to the Lochaber axes.In his book Scots Heraldry, former Lord Lyon Sir Thomas Innes notes that the general uptake of heraldry in Scotland is historically far higher per capita than in England. This is something he ties to the sense of family and clan belonging. Though to have personal arms recognised with the ancient authority charged with ­protecting the country’s national symbols, the Court of the Lord Lyon, only further exemplifies the link between sub-national identities and our sense of Scottishness.            The Honorary Vexillologist role within the Court of the Lord Lyon will be assisting the development of community flags and also to support the continuing enrichment of our national symbolism through helping to develop civic and ­personal heraldry. It is this richness that not only deepens our national identity but also gives it a healthy breadth as well. It is absolutely no surprise that flags have taken off so strongly in recent years as they are only one more instance of an important foundation to our national identity, and a lot of the honorary vexillologist’s focus will be given over to them. Each type of symbol ­mentioned plays a significant part in realising this, but each does this to their own strengths. Community flags have found a unique place in providing their people with a recognisable, versatile and highly visible ­symbol that is free to use by all. This makes these flags not only perfect to be seen next to the Saltire but they enrich it too. It is to Scotland’s great pride that the Court of the Lord Lyon continues a centuries long duty of protecting our national symbols but is also able to empower the nation’s communities in developing their own.Philip Tibbetts is honorary vexillologist for Scotland’s heraldic authority, the Court of the Lord Lyon."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4784777.1534404275!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin the massive elephant in the room at the snp s conference","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The lack of a debate on Andrew Wilson\u0026#8217s Growth Commission at SNP conference is a startling omission, writes Tom Peterkin.                Councillor Christopher McEleny is fast emerging as one of the SNP’s more colourful characters. Twice he has stood to be SNP depute leader. Twice he has been defeated, firstly by Angus Robertson, and most recently by Keith Brown, the former Economy Secretary who is now Nicola Sturgeon’s right-hand man as far as the party is concerned.            Despite being on the receiving end of comprehensive defeats, the Inverclyde councillor refuses to slide back into the relative obscurity of local authority politics.            It was earlier this month that Mr McEleny found himself in the headlines when the judge in an employment tribunal ruled that his support for Scottish independence qualified as a “philosophical belief”. The conclusion was reached by judge Frances Eccles in a case that saw Mr McEleny pursue his former employer, the Ministry of Defence, claiming he had been unfairly targeted over his views.The background to the case was that around the time of his first unsuccessful attempt to become SNP depute leader in 2016, he was told that his security clearance had been revoked for his job as an electrician at the MoD munitions site in Beith, North Ayrshire.He said he was interviewed by national security officials on issues including his pro-independence views. After being suspended from his job, he left it, claiming he was unfairly targeted for his stance on leaving the UK and his support for the “social democratic values” of the SNP.READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission report: Five key points            In her judgment, Judge Eccles rather neatly summed up exactly how Mr McEleny felt about Scottish independence.“The claimant was clear in his evidence that he does not believe in Scottish independence because it will necessarily lead to improved economic and social conditions for people living in Scotland”, she said. “It is a fundamental belief in the right of Scotland to national sovereignty.”So there you have it. Mr McEleny’s belief in breaking up the UK runs through him like letters through a stick of rock. His desire for indep­endence is so strong that it trumps pro-indy arguments based on the notion that securing a Yes vote is the best way to improve Scotland economically and socially.Given that independence – come what may and damn the consequences – appears to be an existential part of the councillor’s being, it was perhaps somewhat surprising to see his most recent contribution to internal SNP politics.            Earlier this week Mr McEleny took to Twitter to reveal that the party’s latest independence blueprint will not be debated at its October conference. He said it was “absolutely astonishing” that the list of 32 motions for debate in Glasgow did not include any of Andrew Wilson’s much-vaunted Growth Commission or his proposal to stick with the pound for around a decade after independence. Even the man for whom independence is a “philosophical belief” is objecting to the party’s failure to take a long and hard look at the harsh economic reality at independence. A similar row erupted before the SNP’s most recent conference in June, which happened to take place shortly after Mr Wilson published his 354-page magnum opus.Despite the fact that the SNP document was the hot topic of the moment, there was no formal debate on its proposals, which are absolutely fundamental to the party’s next drive for independence. Instead, discussion of the document was relegated to a fringe meeting. That meeting offered some explanation as to why it might suit the SNP not to pore over the document in public. It was easily the stormiest session of the conference as the former SNP MP and economist George Kerevan criticised its contents. READ MORE: SNP Growth Commission strengthens case for union, claims pro-UK think tankThe future plotted by the commission would, said Mr Kerevan, leave Scotland “at the mercy” of the banks, because its plans to keep the pound without Bank of England protection for a decade would hinder the ability to grow the Scottish economy. This, he argued, would put the poor at risk.            The difficulty for the SNP is that Mr Kerevan’s views are shared by many who, like him, can be found on the left of the party. Mr Wilson won praise for constructing a more realistic case for independence than that made in Alex Salmond’s white paper published ahead of the 2014 referendum.But realism can have its drawbacks. Mr Wilson’s approach to cutting Scotland’s £13.3 billion deficit has seen the highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warn that Scotland would see a “continuation of austerity”.One can understand why the SNP leadership might be reluctant to air these points and internal divisions at their autumn shindig. Rather, the Growth Commission is to be discussed internally at a series of SNP National Assemblies. The outcome of these discussions are then scheduled to be brought before party conference in spring next year or the National Council this coming December. In the meantime, it feels strange to be heading to another SNP conference where the biggest elephant in the room will be Mr Wilson’s indy blueprint.Or as the Inverclyde councillor who is rapidly becoming the SNP’s best-known controversialist put it: “How can we not be debating the biggest contribution to the independence case since 2014?”That may not amount to a “philosophical belief” for Councillor McEleny, but it is still a pretty good point."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4785509.1534451595!/image/image.jpg","title":"two thirds of scots teenagers don t want immigration to rise","story":"        Almost two-thirds of Scottish teenagers think immigration levels should be cut or remain the same as they are now, according to official research.                The views of secondary school children emerged in a study commissioned by the Scottish Government, which sought their opinion on one of the biggest political issues in the UK.            The Young People’s Attitudes to Immigration report is based on research carried out by pollsters Ipsos Mori, who spoke to more than 1,700 secondary pupils in state schools across Scotland.            It found that 30 per cent of pupils in S1 to S6 – covering an age range of 11 to 18 – believe that immigration should be “decreased” or “stopped completely”.More than a third (35 per cent) felt that immigration should be kept at the current level, meaning that a total of 65 per cent of teenagers think it should stay the same or fall. Only 15 per cent of those surveyed said they thought immigration should be increased, while the remaining 20 per cent said they did not know or would rather not answer.The Scottish Government has repeatedly warned that the UK’s commitment to cutting net migration poses a major risk to economic prosperity north of the border.There is general political agreement in Scotland that levels of immigration should be maintained rather than cut for the economy to grow, with working age migrants needed to fill jobs.The SNP’s Growth Commission also called for migrants to be offered tax breaks if Scotland votes for independence, allowing the country to grow its population and support the economy.            The survey of young people also showed that older pupils were more likely to feel positive about the impact of immigration in Scotland than those in other year groups.Almost 30 per cent of those in S6, who are generally aged 16 or older and can vote in Scottish Parliament elections, felt that the impact of immigration had been “mostly good”.However, this dropped significantly among younger pupils, with only 12 to 14 per cent of those in S1, S2 and S3 agreeing. Girls also perceived the impact of immigration less negatively than boys.Much like among adults, attitudes to immigration varied depending on people’s economic background, with wealthier students more positive than those from more deprived areas.            A Scottish Government spokesman said: “It is important that we engage with young people and seek their views on issues which affect them and their future, including immigration.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"maunsie da market cross introduces shopping week ","story":"The Lerwick Shopping Week begins today (Monday) with the announcement of the new town centre mascot.\n\u0026#8220Maunsie da Market Cross\u0026#8221 was designed by local artist Stephen Gordon, and chosen from 28 entries to a competition which sought a character to represent Lerwick town centre.\nLiving Lerwick project manager Emma Miller said: \u0026#8220We were looking for something that visually represented the town centre and Stephen\u0026#8217s entry was just perfect – you can\u0026#8217t get anything more representative of the toon centre than the market cross.\n\u0026#8220The standard of entries was excellent and we’d like to thank everyone who took the time to put their ideas on paper.\u0026#8221\nAs part of the shopping week activities the public can search for Maunsie in local shops by collecting a form from the VisitScotland office at the Market Cross.\nThere will also be a life-sized version of Maunsie visiting a number of shops for the public to meet him and take selfies for uploading to social media.

One donor, who wished to remain anonymous, pledged \u0026pound15,000 to complete the funding for the area\u0027s first outdoor covered venue at the Inverdruie base.\nClub treasurer Yvonne Birnie said: \"We are delighted with the support we have had from local businesses and the community for phase two of our Courts4All Project.

The intention is that it can be used in all weather and not only by tennis players and other sports enthusiasts but also by the likes of the Cubs and Scouts, Guides, playgroups, charities and even for children\u0027s parties and ceilidhs.\nThe mystery benefactor came forward after reading last week\u0027s appeal in the Strathy.\nA spokesman for the donor said: \"The extent of the community\u0027s input into the campaign was really impressive and that\u0027s what swung it.\n\"Local people had put in a major effort to raise their share of the cost and the project deserves to get off the ground.

That would have continued but a bank paramedic was eventually able to be brought in halfway through the period to provide a single-manned service.\nTwo days had been due to lost because of fatigue breaks and two to cover holiday leave at the ambulance base off Grampian Road.\nGMB Scotland said this highlights that current staff work patterns in some rural communities including the strath are unsustainable and not fit for the 21st century.\nThe Scottish Ambulance Service has stressed it \"provides full coverage at all times, including this last week\".\nThe union and the Strathy have been campaigning for the outdated system \u0026ndash which now predominantly only operates in the Highlands in Scotland \u0026ndash to be replaced by shift patterns which would provide 24/7 cover for the Aviemore area and ease pressure on the service elsewhere locally.\nJohn Marr, branch secretary for the GMB at SAS, said ahead of the staff cover being found in time for Tuesday afternoon: \"This situation is exactly why the GMB has been calling on the Scottish Government and the SAS to fund stations such as Aviemore and Golspie by the busy A9 to allow them to be staffed 24/7 so that such a dangerous situation can not arise again.\n\"Tourism numbers are rising year on year because of the popularity of the Cairngorms as a visitor destination and starring roles on the screen such as in Outlander.\n\"The village\u0027s population is growing all the time with new houses.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nFriday 17 Aug 2018 7:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116807.jpg","title":"Dont play mother to lost wildcat kittens","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nThe public is being urged to be hands off if they spot a possible Scottish Wildcat kitten in the wilds of Strathspey unless they are certain it is in immediate danger.\nExperts have issued the warning after a well-meaning member of the public removed possible kittens from the wild and their mother.\nRare wildcats \u0026ndash and other cats in the countryside \u0026ndash are now at an age when they are out and about, even without their mums.\nScottish Wildcat Action Project Officer Emma Rawling said: \"If anyone sees tabby kittens alone in a possible wildcat area and or if mother looks like a wildcat, the public should be cautious and assume they could be wildcat kittens.\n\"Wildcats are protected by law.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team.

As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

We are looking to make this a regular occurrence which will benefit all agencies. Recruitment was also a priority for the agencies and we are keen to encourage new, keen local individuals to become part of our emergency services family. We look forward to hearing from interested members of the public who may become valuable members of the emergency services in the future.”\nAs far as the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is concerned, Mr. Colliar said anyone is welcome to drop in when training is taking place at Skye fire stations. Dunvegan, Portree, Staffin and Raasay train between 7 pm and 9 pm every Monday, as does Raasay, while Uig is on a Tuesday evening and Broadford on Wednesday.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f-jpg.jpg","title":"65470  ","story":"    \nNORTHERN Ireland have been crowned World Champions after the local sailors took on the best from around the world for the Atlantic Challenge and won.\nTeams of young people from around the globe converged on Lough Neagh for the toughest test of endurance, strength and skill.\nThe Northern Ireland crew had an outstanding week in Antrim, with big wins in the two Jackstay Transfer tasks, traditional rope work, man overboard and the rowing slalom races.

inspires local woman to take on berlin marathon","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman is taking on 26.2 miles at one of the world’s most famous marathons on September 16 to help raise money for the British Heart Foundation Northern Ireland (BHF NI).\n  \nMairead Agnew was inspired by her young neighbour Mark Lynn, who has complex congenital heart disease. At just 8 years old, he has undergone four open heart surgeries and numerous cardiac procedures. \n  \nIn 2015 Mark was diagnosed with heart failure but this still hasn’t stopped him and his parents Donna and Geoff supporting BHF NI and raising almost \u0026pound3,000 for the charity.\n  \nMairead explained: “My sister was born with congenital heart disease so this is a cause that has always been extremely close to mine and my family’s hearts. When I saw the wonderful fundraising that Mark and his family had raised, I wanted to do something to help. When I told Mark I was taking on the Berlin Marathon, he was sure he wanted us to support BHF NI once again.”\n  \nKaren McCammon, Health Services Engagement Lead for BHF NI explained: “When the BHF was founded in 1961, 8 out of every 10 babies born with congenital heart disease died before their first birthday. Our research has helped to turn this around, and now 8 out of 10 babies survive to adulthood. Breakthroughs such as these are only possible because of the support we receive from supporters like Mairead, Mark and his family. We are therefore extremely grateful for all their efforts.”\n  \nBHF have also developed pioneering surgical techniques to treat complex congenital defects.

I understand that the work is expected to last right up until Christmas.\n  \n“My issue is firstly there has been no consultation, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are planning to do. \n  \n“We are relying on hearsay at the minute and I have heard that there are plans to lay stone similar to the rest of the town.” \n  \nClaire said she had written a letter to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council about the issue.\n  \nShe continued: “It took ten days to get a reply which said there was “nothing concrete at the minute”.\n  \nClaire said that among her concerns was that the area has a very slopping street which raises issues around what type of paving is used.\n  \nShe added: “Also there are concerns around water flowing down the street due to the slope and the fact that if the paving used is light in colour chewing gum, which will eventually cover it, will turn black and soon make the street look grubby and shabby.”\n  \nClaire said she would like to see either the street remain the same and be “brought back to its former glory” or be consulted on any proposed plans.\n  \n“We want to have a debate about it, not have to rely on hearsay. I have a sizeable investment in this street and I feel as a business owner I should have a say,” she concluded.\n  \nA Mid and East Antrim Council spokesperson said: “Plans are being considered to extend the public realm scheme on this street, however, these are at a very early stage. \n  \n“We will be liaising with traders over the coming weeks in relation to initial consultation on concept designs.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921291.jpg--.jpg?1534232684000\n","title":"dungonnell dam features on ulster giants tv show","story":"  \nA reservoir in the hills between Ballymena and the glens features in the new series celebrating the achievements in Northern Ireland of the Institution of Civil Engineers on the occasion of their 200th anniversary. \n  \nThe fifth episode of ‘Ulster Giants’, which continues on Monday, August 20 at 8pm on UTV is all about water and the various ways in which it has been collected, stored and treated before being delivered to our homes and workplaces. \n  \nJoe Mahon’s first port of call is the now abandoned Hunt’s Park Water Tower in Donaghadee in Co. Down. \n  \nAnd of local interest, he also visits the water treatment works at Dungonnell Dam in the Antrim Hills. \n  \nJoe interviews Derek McKane of NI Water, who demonstrates the operation of the dam and takes him on a tour of the bewildering number of processes our modern water supply has to undergo before it is deemed fit for human consumption. \n  \n“After watching this you’ll never take tap water for granted again!” Joe promises.\n  \nCivil engineer Alan Cooper then directs our attention to the innovative construction of the actual dam itself – the first to be built using asphalt, and employing many of the same construction methods you would find in road-building! Alan rounds off with some insights into the general history of dam-building in this country and relates how civil engineering has developed its own code of ethics over the 200 years since the foundation of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_921285.jpg--.jpg?1534232428000\n","title":"estelle in the frame for spectacle wearer of year win","story":"  \nA Ballymena woman has been chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for Specsavers’ Spectacle Wearer of the Year.\n  \nEstelle Wallace, shortlisted in the 45 – 59 age category from Rasharkin could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning \u0026pound10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual awards. \n  \nGlasses wearers across the UK and Republic of Ireland have been showing off their specs style by sharing their selfies online.\n  \nEstelle, who is a health and wellness coach, was invited to visit her local Specsavers store in Fairhill Shopping Centre to receive a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a \u0026pound125 glasses voucher.\n  \nEstelle said: “I was really delighted to be shortlisted as a regional finalist.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

Their actions made history but Dungannon’s pivotal role in the quest for social justice was soon forgotten as images of beaten and bloodied marchers on the Duke Street march that October grabbed headlines around the world.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDungannon-born presenter Lynette Fay with Bernadette McAliskey during recording for Stories in Sound: In The Footsteps, due to be broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster this Sunday (August 19) at 12.30pm\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBorn in Dungannon only a decade later, presenter Lynette Fay had no idea that people she knew growing up – her brother’s primary school teacher, and her next door neighbours – were among the organisers of that first march.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602191.1534343875!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising in memory of elizabeth","story":"\nElizabeth Adams was an employee of Mountvale Private Nursing Home, Dromore for over 11 years, she was a work colleague but mainly a friend.  \n\n                \nAfter a short illness called Sarcoidosis, she passed away peacefully on January 15.

Since its formation in 1994, the initiative has sent over 2000 students from Northern Ireland to all four corners of the United States where they have successfully completed a year studying\n\nJonathan Stewart, Director, British Council Northern Ireland, added: “I am confident that the students departing for the US this year will be great ambassadors for Northern Ireland and will help to further important long-term links and connections. A recent report published by the British Council has highlighted that the relationship between the US and the UK is driven as much by cultural factors, as political with programmes such as Study USA supporting these links and strengthening them for the future. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Through Study USA, students will have the opportunity to not only enhance their employability skills but also develop intercultural skills, which will help them to prepare to work in a global economy. We wish them success, and trust that new connections and friendships will be developed in the year ahead.”\n\nStudy USA is just one of many international opportunities available through British Council Northern Ireland.

In addition, the company has faced an extremely challenging retail trading environment reflecting weak consumer confidence and reduced consumer spending. These factors have had a significant adverse impact on Homebase’s trading position.\n\n“After a comprehensive review, Homebase has concluded that its current store portfolio mix is no longer viable. Rental costs associated with stores are unsustainable and many stores are loss making.\n\n“The CVA enables Homebase to make essential changes to its store portfolio, reducing its cost base and providing a stable platform on which to continue its turnaround.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Under the terms of the CVA proposal, all creditors receive a better outcome than any other likely alternative.\n\n“It is anticipated that 42 stores will close during late 2018 and early 2019.\n\n“The proposed changes to the store portfolio will regrettably mean redundancies from those stores earmarked for closure. The process is expected to lead to a reduction of up to 1,500 roles, although every effort will be made to redeploy team members within the business where possible.\n\n“All stores in the UK and the Republic of Ireland will remain open for business as usual and this process will have no impact on customer purchases, outstanding orders or any product or service guarantees.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The creditors will vote on the CVA on 31 August 2018.”\n\nDamian McGloughlin, CEO of Homebase, said: “Launching a CVA has been a difficult decision and one that we have not taken lightly. Homebase has been one of the most recognisable retail brands for almost 40 years, but the reality is we need to continue to take decisive action to address the underperformance of the business and deal with the burden of our cost base, as well as to protect thousands of jobs. The CVA is therefore an essential measure for the business to take and will enable us to refocus our operations and rebuild our offer for the years ahead.”\n\nStephanie Pollitt, Assistant Director of Real Estate Policy, British Property Federation (BPF), said: “These situations are never easy as property owners need to take into consideration the impact on their investors, including those protecting their investors’ pensioners’ savings, as they vote on the CVA proposal. Homebase and Alvarez \u0026amp Marsal have, however, demonstrated best practice, engaging with the BPF in the process and therefore ensuring property owners’ interests have been properly taken into account. Ultimately, it will be for individual property owners to decide how they will vote on the CVA, but the proposal has sought to find a solution that provides a sustainable future for Homebase.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8478809.1533901811!/image/image.jpg","title":"was speeding in hurry to get to work","story":"\nIn a hurry to get to work a 49-year-old man broke the speed limit in his van, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nAsen Asenov, whose address was given as Flush Place, Lurgan, was fined £75 for excess speed on May 30 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThree penalty points were also imposed and he was ordered to pay a £15 offender’s levy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor having a defective light on his vehicle he was fined £50.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe court heard that at 11.30pm on the Portadown Road in Lurgan police saw a Mercedes Sprinter van with a Bulgarian registration travelling in excess of the 40mph speed limit.\n\nThey followed the van for a distance of over half a mile and to keep up they were doing between 60mph and 65mph.\n\nPolice also noticed that the right rear side light was not working.\n\nThrough an interpreter Asenov said he had been rushing that day.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained that he had already received a warning about his job and he didn’t want to be late.

As the years went on they became less and less involved, but they were still on our board of directors for a number of years.\n“As time went on we became more secular and we didn’t have that relationship with the Church anymore. But we’re still very grateful for them for setting it up and for identifying the huge need for counselling and support in this area, I suppose because Ardoyne was hit so hard by the conflict.\n“The Passionists worked tirelessly, and I remember sister Kathleen constantly bringing funders into a room and saying ‘You have got to fund this.’ Because there was very little funding in the early days she worked extremely hard to get us established, funded and working.\n“We have grown considerably, and we now deliver about 12,000 to 13,000 sessions a year to about 2,500 people. As well as operating from this site, we also work in a range of local schools and community venues. If someone wants to be seen or needs help somewhere else we can do that too.”\nNorma continued: “Our clinical practice is excellent. We have just been awarded BACP [British Association for Counselling and Psycho-therapy) accreditation for our services. Most counsellors are individually accredited by the BACP, but very few organisations carry the accreditation. We are one of only six in Northern Ireland to be accredited this year.”\nWith a degree in psychology and a professional background in both therapy and conflict resolution, Norma said that New Life felt like a place where she could make a difference.\nIn the past, she has worked at New Life as a sessional counsellor and her experience in play therapy has allowed her to help children and adults alike. New Life is one of the few organisations in the north that offers child and family therapy – services that Norma insists are vital for North Belfast.\n“I think in this area you are working with generations of people who have had things really difficult,” she said.\n“Personal safety was at risk throughout the Troubles and the area has grown up with generations and generations of high unemployment. Poverty, conflict and trauma have a huge impact, not just psychologically, but on a cellular level it impacts people physically.\n“Poverty also has a huge impact on children’s education and a number of different things, so we’re working with multiple issues for a lot of families and they are trying really hard to overcome those things. It has a massive impact on people’s self-esteem, so it’s almost a vicious cycle.”\nShe continued: “There is a lot of research that has come out recently into adverse experience in childhood and the impact that those have on physical health, mental health, and educational achievement. The aim is to try to tackle things early. I think that’s why we believe that child therapy is so important, because you’ve got to be working with children from an early age to begin to address their issues early on.\n“If you don’t catch certain things in childhood, sometimes you’re working with very difficult teenage years because it’s harder to intervene. Sometimes those teenagers will come back as adults and they will feel like they are ready to tackle the issue at that stage.\n“At any stage in life it’s encouraging to know that anything can be repaired. Our brains are wonderful organs and in many ways they have a great plasticity so you can address those issues, you just have to be motivated and have the right motivator to identify what that change might look like.\n“Not everybody needs counselling, sometimes a friend or a colleague or anyone you can connect with can transform things for you. Talking to anybody helps you and can help you, but counselling gives a framework and a focus for those who need it.\n“If you can catch people before they hit the crisis it’s much better. When you’re in a crisis your ability to think clearly, to support yourself or to act lessens, so it’s much harder to activate the changes you need. If you can get into counselling when you’re not in crisis then you’ll be able to change things more quickly, but counselling can really help. It helps you to clear your mind enough to realise what needs to happen next to take you out of crisis.”\nWhile New Life has come on leaps and bounds since it began, offering thousands of yearly counselling sessions, Norma admits that mental health charities, including New Life, need more support to effectively help those in need of support.\n“I think pre-Troubles we didn’t have nearly enough mental health services,” she said.\n“People were just in lockdown mode, they were just surviving. Since the peace process there has been a lot more services established. I think mental health services are still desperately underfunded in Northern Ireland given what we have come through.\n“For our service we have a six-month waiting list and sometimes it can go up to a year. If you need a counsellor it’s way too long to wait, but we don’t have the funding to deliver any more sessions than we currently do.\n“I think there needs to be more accessible services. People get fed up sitting on a waiting list and a lot can happen in that space of time.”\nShe concluded: “If you do need someone to talk to it’s important that you come forward. Young people, especially can access our services quite quickly so we would really encourage them to come forward.”\nIf you think you might benefit from talking to New Life, call 90 391630.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37215278.ece/3d20d/AUTOCROP/w300square/img-2692_orig.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast twelfth cleanup costs revealed","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself. I would like thank genuine Celtic supporter.”\n\nNovo was left fighting for his life in January after suffering a heart attack while starring in a Rangers legends tournament in Germany. The star received thousands of goodwill messages.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt nodeal brexit would be a mistake we would regret for generations","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

that the Government would consider EU proposals that demanded accepting European environmental and social legislation, in order to facilitate a free trade agreement.\n\nThe comments came in an interview with ITV News after a meeting with the Dutch foreign minister as part of a three-day tour of Northern Europe.\n\nWhen asked whether he was presenting the Government’s Brexit plan as “take it or leave it”, Mr Hunt answered: “No, but it is a framework on which I believe the ultimate deal will be based and I’ve been to several countries and met seven foreign ministers and am meeting more in the weeks ahead and I’m getting a strong sense that not just in Holland but in many of the places I’ve visited that they do want to engage seriously to try and find a way through to try and get a pragmatic outcome.”\n\n\n\nIt (no-deal Brexit) would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we had a messy, ugly divorce and would inevitably change British attitudes towards Europe\nJeremy Hunt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the UK would make concessions regarding environmental and social legislation, Mr Hunt responded: “I think we have to see what their proposal was, some of those things can have an impact on the level playing field, some won’t.”\n\nDiscussing the risk of no proper negotiated deal he said: “It would be a mistake we would regret for generations, if we had a messy, ugly divorce and would inevitably change British attitudes towards Europe.”\n\nAsked to compare himself with Boris Johnson’s approach as foreign secretary he said: “I think the role of the foreign secretary is to go around foreign capitals and point out the implications of not getting a deal are profound in terms of our friendship and corporation with foreign countries across a whole range of areas.”\n\nMr Hunt went on to respond to reports that Brussels Brexit negotiators were concerned they were being bugged by British spies.\n\nOfficials had raised security concerns after the UK obtained sensitive documents “within hours” of them being discussed, according to the Daily .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Hunt is touring northern Europe (David Cheskin/PA)\n\n\n\n\nSabine Weyand, the EU’s deputy chief Brexit negotiator, reportedly told officials at a European Council working party on exit talks that “it could not be excluded” that British intelligence had penetrated their meetings.\n\nMr Hunt, when asked about the rumours, said: “I’m Foreign Secretary and foreign secretaries never comment on such matters but you are a journalist and you don’t have any trouble finding out what is going on in those meeting just like you have no problems in finding out what’s happening in our London meetings.”\n\nA European Commission spokesman told journalists in Brussels at a regular briefing: “The commission’s position today is that we cannot comment on this press report.”\n\nIt comes as Brexit talks resumed in Brussels between UK and EU officials.\n\nBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier are not involved in the latest round of discussions, which are focused on the Irish border and future relations, and are due to finish on Friday.\n\nThe spokesman said: “As this week’s round is at technical level there won’t be a meeting between Michel Barnier and Dominic Raab.\n\n“We will confirm in due course whether a subsequent meeting has been arranged.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts moira road in lisburn closed following accident","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards. Additional rail services will also run across both days.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dolly parton ariana grande and janelle monae add to aretha franklin tributes","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I am infinitely THANKFUL”\n\nMr Obama and his wife Michelle said in a statement that Franklin, who performed at his first inauguration in 2009, “helped define the American experience” through her “compositions and unmatched musicianship”.\n\n“In her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade – our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect,” the Obamas added.\n\n“She helped us feel more connected to each other, more hopeful, more human. And sometimes she helped us just forget about everything else and dance.\n\n“Aretha may have passed on to a better place, but the gift of her music remains to inspire us all. May the Queen of Soul rest in eternal peace. Michelle and I send our prayers and warmest sympathies to her family and all those moved by her song.”\n\n\nI will forever cherish the moments I spent in your presence. Your indelible impact was earned not only by your incomparable voice but by your bigger than life personality, wit and humor. I say a BIG prayer for you. You will forever have all our RESPECT.

The Queen of Soul. The Icon. The ultimate singers’ singer. The greatest singer and musician of my lifetime.

Absolutely heartbroken she’s gone, what a woman. Thank you for everything, the melodies and the movements.”\n\nSir Elton John, who was present for Franklin’s last ever performance, called her death a “blow for everybody who loves real music: Music from the heart, the soul and the Church”.\n\nHer friend, record producer Quincy Jones, wrote on Twitter: “From the time that Dinah Washington 1st told me that Aretha was the ‘next one’ when she was 12-years old, until the present day, Aretha Franklin set the bar \u0026 she did it with the professionalism, class, grace, \u0026 humility that only a true Queen could…\n"},{"url":null,"title":"house of fraser apologises after cancelling all online orders","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

I don’t have time to go back to Edinburgh with the trousers which are now totally useless! What do you suggest I do!”\n\nA message posted on the retailer’s website said it was “working hard to make some improvements”, telling customers it will be “back up and running as soon as possible”.\n\nThe Times reported that employees at a key warehouse supplying products to House of Fraser stores and online shoppers had downed tools in a wrangle over delivery payment terms with Sports Direct.\n\nThe paper said it understood that workers at the chain’s distribution centre in Wellingborough had been told by XPO Logistics, which operates the site, to stop accepting goods and processing deliveries, leading to product shortages in some House of Fraser outlets.\n\nSports Direct owner Mike Ashley said his ambition was to turn the department store into the “Harrods of the high street” after buying the firm from administrators earlier this month.\n\nThe £90 million rescue bid saw Sports Direct acquire all 59 House of Fraser stores, the brand and all of the retailer’s stock.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"mps would vote on paisleys commons suspension if he resigns to force byelection","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This harsh reality. \n\n\n\nDear students, your A-levels aren’t so important. What matters most is that your parents have a house in London or the south-east in which to put you up during internships and then to use as equity for you to buy your first home. Don’t change your grades! Change your parents.\n— Aditya Chakrabortty (@chakrabortty) \nAugust 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n8.

He came to the UK as a child refugee and has two degrees in Space Engineering. He\u0027s looking for a JOB IN FINANCE.\nPlease RT! DM me for his CV if you want to hire someone smart who thinks outside the box🙌 \npic.twitter/cgQ1lBfBNY\n\n— Mary Engleheart (@MaryEngleheart) \nAugust 14, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“At the International Rescue Committee I see and hear stories every day that show that when refugees are given the opportunity to succeed, they thrive,” she said.\n\n“Mohamed is living proof of the ingenuity and courage of refugees. I decided to tweet his picture and see whether anyone could help to find him a job.”\n\nThe 22-year-old came to the UK as a refugee from Libya when he was three.\n\nThanks to his mother’s passion for educating her children, Mohamed went on to study aerospace engineering at Southampton University and is finishing his masters degree in space engineering at UCL.\n\nHe is shocked by the attention his ingenuity is getting.\n\n“It really is overwhelming,” he told the Press Association.\n\n“The main reason I had the confidence to stand at Canary Wharf was because I thought no one I knew would be there so there was no reason to be embarrassed!”\n\n\nGreat to see there are many options to choose from. We’d love to see Mohamed’s CV as we’ve got some great graduate programmes in our Global Banking and Markets business. Find out more here: \nhttps://t.co/1Hf0Q8gGNk\n\n— HSBC UK Careers (@HSBC_UK_Careers) \nAugust 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t the first move Mohamed has made to try to get on the job ladder.\n\n“I, of course, applied to all of the major and the boutique firms during the milk round but I had found little success. I knew whenever I was offered an interview I would do really well, because that’s in my control.”\n\nWhen these didn’t work out, Mohamed began to think outside the box. Inspired by David Casarez, a young man who took a similar approach in Silicon Valley, he hopped on the Tube, hoping to land an opportunity.\n\n“I’m hoping for a job in a client-facing role related to finance,” he said.\n\n“For the last two or so years I’ve had a keen interest in the markets and how the events of the world can have a drastic impact on the markets. I’m particularly interested in using AI to help predict market movements.”\n\n\nUPDATE: Mohamed has three job interviews lined up this week. Thank you everyone for this outpouring of support to \n#GetMohamedAJob\n! \nProud today, as every day, to \n#StandWithRefugees\n. \nhttps://t.co/hBvVO14q0w\n\n— Mary Engleheart (@MaryEngleheart) \nAugust 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\nHe is yet to receive a job offer, but has three interviews lined up.

be advised of the Foyle Bridge closure by message signs dispersed throughout the city. \n\nTraffic from Clearwater and Bridge Water will also have to enter the contraflow at the crossover at Caw Hill Park.\n\nDuring phase two of the resurfacing, the green hatched area on the roundabout nearest Crescent Link will be closed for resurfacing. \n\nDuring this a contraflow system will be set up to allow traffic to travel in both directions on the Limavady bound lane of Clooney Road dual carriageway. \n\nCommenting, the SDLP councillor for the area Martin Reilly welcomed the work, but added that he hoped disruption would be kept to a minimum during the works.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"packed programme events foyle pride festival kicks off derry weekend","story":"\nThe aim of Foyle Pride Festival is to acknowledge, empower and celebrate the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans) community in the Derry area as well as the wider LGBT community as a whole. \n\nThe group is Non-Profit grassroots organisation that was formed in order to hold, and continue, an annual Pride Festival.\n\n2018 will mark its 25th year during which time it has gone from strength to strength, with an ethos of continuing to supporting equality and the rights of those who identify as LGBT. \n\nThis year’s week-long Foyle Pride Festival begins Saturday, with the festival culminating in the massive parade which will depart from the Waterside Train Station at 2pm on Saturday, August 25.\n\nHowever, before the parade brings the festival to an end, there are a host of events people can attend as part of the packed programme of events.\n\nThe festival will kick off this Saturday with the ‘Gay’s the Word’ exhibition, featuring photographs celebrating Foyle Pride over the past 25 years, which will take place at the Ulster Bank building in Waterloo Place at 9pm.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push(function () {            var mapMpu = googletag.sizeMapping()                .addSize([100, 100], [[320,

26 will see two great events, with the Brandywell hosting the Football versus Homophobia tournament from 1pm-4pm, with the action then switching to the Holywell Trust building at 5pm for the ‘Big Gay Bake Off’, showcasing the best Pride themed cakes the city has to offer.\n\nThe festival will also be screening the latest LGBT themed movies at the Nerve Centre Cinema, including A Fantastic Woman on Monday, August 20 at 7pm, Beach Rats at 7pm on Tuesday, August 21 at 7pm, God’s Own Country on Thursday, August 23 at the same time and the critically acclaimed 120 BPM, which will be screened on Friday, August 24 at 7pm.\n\nAs with previous festivals, this year’s programme features a number of talks and panel discussions.\n\nOn Tuesday, August 21, the Ulster Bank building will host ‘Out in the Past’, the first part of which will see Hilary McCollum discuss ‘The Lesbian Suffragettes’ which will be followed by Brian Lacey hosting ‘Being Gay in Derry – The 70’s to the 90’s’.\n\nMeanwhile, the following night will see the building host a panel discussion, ‘Gay Rights and Civil Rights: Then and Now’, at 7pm.\nFor a full list of events, go
