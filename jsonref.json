It’s what has been dubbed ‘tantrum diplomacy’.He’s been deep in argument with the Swiss over a failed bid to supply jet fighters he’s picked a huge public fight with the Australians and Americans over a submarine deal that the French were cut out of and he ceaselessly lectures the Poles, Hungarians and Czechs on their defiance of the EU’s supremacy and righteousness.But his over-riding obsession is causing trouble for Britain.In Dublin, the French embassy is busy proclaiming France to be Ireland’s closest European neighbour, adding to the tensions over the already fraught Northern Ireland Agreement.In Edinburgh, his diplomats assiduously court the SNP.His prime minister Jean Castex has written to the EU demanding that Britain be punished for denying fishing licences to French boats — a baseless feud that has at times verged on an all-out trade war, including threats to cut electricity supplies to British-controlled Jersey.Meanwhile, French diplomats are insisting on rigid interpretations of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, a toxic document that seems only to guarantee endless conflicts and inconveniences, that hurt Europe as much as Britain.His forthcoming presidency of the European Council, starting in January, will only allow him to stir further mischief by agitating for a common EU defence policy in competition with Nato, which he called ‘brain dead’.All of this hides the truth from French voters: as he prepares to face the electorate in the first round of the presidential election on April 10 next year, Macron is floundering.And he sees Britain as the easy scapegoat for all his failings at home.But his greatest shame is that even as his Brexit-inspired hatred is now proven to be costing lives, this Tinpot Napoleon shows no sign of giving up his bizarre crusade against us, however much Boris Johnson might delude himself otherwise.Jonathan Miller is the author of France: A Nation On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown (Published by Gibson Square Books).  adverts.addToArray({pos:mpu_factbox})Advertisement"},{"url":null,"title":"One 65 people Covid England week cases started rise official data shows","story":"Share this articleHe continued: \u0027While the government is unlikely to enforce restrictions for Christmas, family gatherings will undoubtedly increase risk, especially for older and more vulnerable family members who haven’t yet had their third vaccine dose.\u0027Saving Christmas is up to us.

In case you’re still struggling to get your head around the new B.1.1.529 “omicron” variant here’s a helpful explainer on what it all means.  Thanks for following along and you can catch up with the latest coronavirus coverage here. A new blog will be up and running shortly. The country also recorded 465 daily fatalities. The daily rise in new coronavirus infections has been below 20,000 for 50 continuous days and less than 50,000 daily new cases have been reported for 153 consecutive days now, the Times of India reports. Canada is banning foreign travellers to the country from seven African countries. Foreign nationals who have travelled in any of these countries within the previous 14 days will not be permitted entry into Canada. “As a precautionary measure, until January 31, 2022, the Government of Canada is implementing enhanced border measures for all travellers who have been in the Southern Africa region — including South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Namibia— within the last 14 days before arriving in Canada,” a recently published press release reads.  Canadian citizens, permanent residents and people with status under the Indian Act, regardless of their vaccination status or having had a previous history of testing positive for Covid-19, who have been in these countries in the previous 14 days will be subject to enhanced testing, screening, and quarantine measures. Travellers will be required to obtain, within 72 hours of departure, a valid negative Covid test and upon arrival will subject to immediate testing. All travellers will also be required to complete a test on day 8 after arrival and quarantine for 14 days. There will be “increased scrutiny” of quarantine plans for travellers from these countries and “rigorous monitoring” to ensure travellers are complying with quarantine measures, the statement added. The European nation reported an additional 67,125 Covid cases and 303 deaths, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute. This takes the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases to 5,717,295 and total reported deaths to 100,779. “We expect Omicron to be identified quickly, if it emerges in the US,” CDC said in a statement, Reuters reports.Authorities believe the flare-up was caused by exposure to the infected environment by imported cases in other province. The outbreak led to the decision to cancel hundreds of flights on Friday while some schools were shuttered and tour groups suspended as China continues its strict zero-Covid policy.“Resumption of scheduled commercial international passenger services, to and from India, has been examined in consultation with Ministry of Home Affairs, External Affairs and Health, and it has been decided... may be resumed from December 15,” the ministry said on Friday evening. These 14 countries are: the United Kingdom, Singapore, China, Brazil, Bangladesh, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, and New Zealand. The list also includes South Africa, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong - countries that have confirmed cases of the new B.1.1.529 variant of the coronavirus. This updated map indicates incidence rates across the continent.  Australia confirmed it will close its borders to anyone who has been in southern Africa, and is not an Australian citizen, in response to the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. Australian citizens and residents and their dependents arriving from these countries will need to go into immediate supervised quarantine for 14 days, health minister Greg Hunt announced. Anyone who has already arrived in Australia and who has been in any of the nine listed southern African countries within the past 14 days must immediately isolate themselves and be tested for Covid-19 and follow jurisdictional quarantine requirements Australia will also suspend all flights from nine southern African countries for a period of 14 days as a matter of precaution.  The countries concerned are: South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi, and Mozambique“Brazil will close air borders to six African countries due to the new variant of the coronavirus,” Chief of Staff Ciro Nogueira wrote in a Twitter post late Friday evening.  “We are going to protect Brazilians in this new phase of the pandemic in that country. Ordinance will be published tomorrow and should take effect from Monday.” The restrictions will affect travellers from South Africa, Botswana, Swatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe, he added.“7NEWS understands the federal government will today announce changes to travel - in response to new variant,” it said on Twitter on Saturday, without citing sources. “Anyone who has been in South Africa in the last 14 days will likely face quarantine or isolation.” The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, will be holding a press conference at 1pm AEDT. Meanwhile, the federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has called for Australia to close the border to southern African countries. “The Omicron outbreak is a major concern that should be of concern to all Australians. We know the impact that Delta had when it came here. And we can’t afford to be complacent,” he said.  “I make this point, Scott Morrison always waits until a problem becomes a crisis. And then he waits until a crisis becomes a political issue before he acts. He must act today.”“It is not time to break the glass on the alarm, I don’t think, but I’m as concerned about this as I have been since Delta,” Burnet Institute director Brendan Crabb told ABC TV. “A state of heightened alert and caution is appropriate for us in Australia and for the world.” Professor Crabb described the new strain as having “a whole host of mutations that, I must say, makes me have a sharp inhalation of breath”. He stressed the most important thing wasn’t borders, but keeping up vaccine coverage and infection control measures. More on the ‘disaster emergency’ declared by Kathy Hochul, governor of New York state. Hochul confirmed no cases of the Omicron variant has so far been found in the state but cautioned authorities are “on high alert”.  “We continue to see warning signs of spikes in Covid this winter, and while the new Omicron variant has yet to be detected in New York State, it’s coming,” she said in a tweet Friday evening. An order from the governor said the state was experiencing Covid-19 transmission “not seen since April 2020” and that hospital admissions has been increasing over the past month to over 300 a day. The state had to therefore “pursue a coordinated approach to ensure hospital capacity statewide is able to meet regional needs”. European stocks had their worst day in 17 months."},{"url":null,"title":"how safe are our primary schools amid latest covid wave","story":" Matt Melvin, principal at St Etchen’s National School in Kinegad, Co Westmeath, where he has had to step in as a teacher, an SNA and a bus escort on various days this week. Photograph: Alan BetsonJohn Weir, the principal of St Mary’s Parish Primary School in Bryanstown in Drogheda, Co Louth, is looking through the school’s roll book. He can’t remember a time when so many children and staff were out of school.“We’ve seen a massive spike in Covid cases in recent times,” he says. “In some classes there has been close to 50 per cent attendance . . . There are Covid cases, precautionary absences, children waiting on tests, other illnesses. For others, we just don’t know until mum or dad tells us.”Overall, the school has averaged an overall non-attendance rate of about 15 per cent for November, significantly higher than normal.“We’re doing everything to minimise the spread within the school with the prevention measures, but the hard part is keeping it out of the school . . . Many parents are confused about when they can and can’t send their children into school. The guidance is being constantly updated.”The school, he says, has managed to limit transmission within pods to a few cases by acting swiftly when positive cases have been identified, but it feels like a constant battle. The mantra from Government that “schools are safe” doesn’t wash with him.“These children are the only unvaccinated group left in society. Children are in rooms with 28 others for six or seven hours a day. You’re dealing with unmasked children. So, it’s very hard to see that they are ‘safe’.”Highest infectionLatest figures released this week show that primary school-aged children now have the highest Covid-19 incidence of any age group, with some 10,000 positive cases in the past fortnight.A report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) notes that the infection rate for primary school-aged children has been rising since mid-October.Many schools have been struggling to keep classes open due to staff shortages linked to high rates of sick leave or teachers being forced to self-isolate due to the virus. Tens of thousands of primary children nationally are estimated to be out of school as well.The scale of the infection rate among young people has prompted urgent questions about how safe primary schools really are.Are risk mitigation measures such as handwashing, opening windows and – potentially – face masks for the over-9s enough to combat the spread of the virus?In primary school staff rooms this week, rumours once again swirled around circuit-breakers and potential school closures.Remarks by Dr Ronan Glynn – the State’s deputy chief medical officer – that “schools are not as safe now as they were” seemed to back up many teachers’ long-standing concerns.The country’s largest primary teachers’ union, the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO), earlier this week warned that the system that was “creaking at the seams” and that teachers had been “abandoned”.However, public health experts are convinced schools remain a low risk for transmission of the disease.They have briefed the Government that most of the infection among children is coming from parents, household contacts and the community, rather than within schools.The latest HPSC report, for example, says increases in the virus among pre-school and primary-aged children have been broadly consistent with increases across other age groups since mid-October.“The risk of onward transmission from undetected asymptomatic cases within the school setting remains low,” it states.RiskDr Abigail Collins, consultant in public health medicine and the HSE’s clinical lead on child health, endorses this. When asked if schools are “safe”, she says public health experts tend to avoid such terms.“We deal with risk assessment. With the right measures in place – such as keeping those with symptoms away from school and having infection controls in place – schools are low risk settings for onward spread of Covid-19,” says Dr Collins.If schools really are such a low risk, why have the Covid-19 rates among five- to 12-year-olds trebled in the last two months?Dr Collins points to a number of factors at play. If there is a high incidence of cases in the wider society, children will get it too via household or community transmission, she says.Children are also the only remaining unvaccinated group in the population. In addition, she says, children tend to get tested more, because there is a strong motivation for parents to do so.“Even now, the proportion of primary children testing positive is quite stable. The numbers are going up for all age groups . . . Are schools or classrooms amplification settings? It’s not what we’re seeing or experiencing.”She points to trends in coronavirus data since schools reopened in September to illustrate the point.Positive cases among children rose in early September when schools reopened, but stabilised and fell a few weeks later.This rise, she says, was likely the result of a major spike in testing which detected asymptomatic cases that would not have been picked up otherwise.Dr Collins says cases only began to rise significantly among primary school children into October when society began to fully reopen.“You can see on the graphs that the adult cases went up, followed by children a little bit afterwards. That’s not a surprise. Children are part of the community. If there are high numbers in the community, there will be high numbers among children.”ScepticalMany principals and teachers, however, are sceptical about official coronavirus figures and have a nagging suspicion that school cases are not being properly recorded.John Boyle of the INTO claims the removal of routine testing and tracing from schools in late September has concealed the escalation of positive case numbers among pupils and staff in primary schools.“It simply cannot be a coincidence that the number of five- to 12-year-old children contracting the virus has trebled since crucial public health supports were removed from the primary sector less than two months ago, abandoning teachers and principals to protect themselves and their unmasked, unvaccinated pupils from the impact of the highest wave of infection in their schools since the pandemic began,” Mr Boyle says.Some principals and teachers also point to official HPSC figures on outbreaks in schools to bolster their case: under the old testing and tracing regime, up to 90 outbreaks were being detected in a single week during in September.Yet last week, without routine contact tracing in schools, just 24 outbreaks were detected.Dr Collins accepts that public health authorities do not have the same level of oversight or visibility of outbreaks than they did under the old testing and tracing regime.However, she says that in outbreaks where there is a public health response, the majority involve just a handful of cases.Where there are high-profile examples of major outbreaks in schools, she says, they tend to have their origin in events outside school which a cluster of children or families have attended, such as a party or event.“Society has opened up . . . That’s not anyone’s fault, but this is what drives transmission,” she says.The other major risk is a Covid-positive child or staff member remaining in school, undetected, for a significant period of time.Many principals and teachers say they want a return of contact tracing at primary level, which they believe will make schools safer by being able to hunt down the virus. They are convinced the system was relaxed too early because the system couldn’t cope with the volume of contact tracing required.Dr Collins, however, argues that the system was unfairly leading to the exclusion of thousands of close contacts of positive cases in schools. Low transmission rates meant the vast majority – about 98 per cent – were testing negative.She says authorities are “extremely conscious of the impact that periods of absence from school have on children’s educational, social and emotional well-being”.In any case, she says the usefulness of contact tracing when there are large volumes of cases in the community is “blunted” and public health messaging becomes more important.“So, public health messages such as ensuring that any child with symptoms of Covid-19 – including a new cough, shortness of breath, high temperature, sore throat – self-isolates and gets a PCR test are so important. That is overwhelmingly the most important thing to do right now.”School closuresAs for rumours about schools closing, they are are just that.“There are very clear international recommendations that schools should be the last places to close and the first to reopen. I think a lot would need to close first before that would ever be considered,” she says.Matt Melvin, principal of St Etchen’s National School in Kinnegad, Co Westmeath, meanwhile, is focused on getting through the next few weeks to Christmas. It has been a case of all hands on deck in recent times,“I’ve been a teacher, an SNA, a bus escort, a cleaner this week – and a principal,” he says, with a smile.His school has been battling with staff shortages and Covid cases, but he is optimistic for the future.“We’ve had cases in school recently – but schools are only a reflection of society. This is one for wider society to get a grip on,” he says.At St Etchen’s, he says, the risk mitigation measures seem to be working: keeping windows open, limiting pupils to pods and using carbon dioxide monitors.“We’re not seeing transmission within school, but we’ve had cases. The children are very compliant. They wash their hands, they stay in their pods and they’ll wear face masks if required,”he says.“They keep an eye on the carbon dioxide monitors and if they go orange, we go out for 10 minutes . . . As far as I’m concerned, the school is calm, secure and safe. The children through this have been great. If the rest of society was half as compliant, we’d be in a much better position.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sefcovic calls for decisive push on talks with uk over northern ireland","story":"Britain’s chief Brexit negotiator David Frost: ‘The gap between our positions is still significant and we are ready to use Article 16 to protect the Belfast Agreement if other solutions cannot be found.’ File photograph: Geert Vanden WijngaertAP PhotoA “decisive push” is needed to ensure predictability in Northern Ireland, the European Union has urged after talks with Britain in London on how to tweak its post-Brexit arrangements.Britain has called for changes beyond a package of adjustments set out by the European Commission in recent months that would reduce checks and paperwork on goods flowing from Britain into the North.Brexit minister David Frost warned that the British government was still prepared to resort to using the contentious Article 16 clause to unilaterally suspend aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol, something the Irish Government has warned would be deeply damaging.“We would still like to find a negotiated solution. But the gap between our positions is still significant and we are ready to use Article 16 to protect the Belfast Agreement if other solutions cannot be found,” Mr Frost said in a statement after meeting European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in London on Friday.“A decisive push is needed to ensure predictability,” Mr Sefcovic said on Twitter after the meeting with Mr Frost. “We’ll meet again next week.” The two sides are seeking to break the deadlock over the implementation of the protocol, which covers the special trading arrangements designed to prevent Brexit creating a hard border re-emerging on the island of Ireland. EU and Irish officials had been concerned that the British government was moving towards triggering Article 16 earlier this month, but momentum appeared to dissipate as the EU warned it would have a severe impact on trade and UK prime minister Boris Johnson faced political trouble at home over a sleaze scandal.Talks between officials from both sides on technical aspects of customs and other arrangements are due to continue throughout the coming week.The EU has been keen to nail down a deal covering medicines, but has found agreement from the UK side to be elusive.There are concerns that time is tight and that a deal on medicines would need to be reached soon in order for the EU to change its laws in time to avoid disruption after the end of this year.A grace period for border checks and regulatory approvals for medicines is due to expire at the end of December and the EU had proposed adjusting its rules to counter any potential disruption to supply.But in order to be in place by the end of the year, the EU had hoped to begin its internal approval procedures in the coming week.Earlier this week, Mr Sefcovic warned that his previously expressed hopes that a deal could be reached before January were “probably too ambitious”.“I think that if there was the clear political will from the UK side these... problems could be solved,” he told Politico. “But looking at how far we progressed over the last four weeks, the level of detail our UK partners want to discuss, I know that we will probably not be able to resolve everything before the end of the year.” How is Brexit affecting you?

Around 600 passengers arrived at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on the two KLM flights on Friday and then faced hours of delays and testing due to concerns over the new virus variant. On the basis of initial testing, the Dutch health ministry estimated there may be around 85 positive cases among the passengers. “Travelers with a positive test result will be placed in isolation at a hotel at or near Schiphol,” health authorities said in a statement. “Of the positive test results, we are researching as quickly as possible whether they are the new variant of concern, now named ‘Omicron’.” The Dutch government banned all air travel from southern Africa early on Friday. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said that passengers already en route to the Netherlands would have to undergo testing and quarantine upon arrival. Passengers on the two KLM flights, from Cape Town and Johannesburg, said they were kept waiting on the tarmac for hours. “Vigorous applause because there is a BUS that has come to take us ... somewhere,” tweeted New York Times journalist Stephanie Nolen, a passenger on the flight from Johannesburg. “Bus to a hall to a huge queue. I can see COVID testers in bright blue PPE far on the distance. Still no snacks for the sad babies,” she added in a second tweet. A spokesperson for the health authorities in Kennemerland, the Dutch region that oversees Schiphol, said the positive cases were being analysed by a Dutch academic medical hospital to determine whether they are the new strain.

While it is surely only a matter of time before a trans woman with a well-oiled moustache starts solving crimes on the BBC in a detective series JK Rowling won’t have written, in my mind 007 can only ever be the womanising old Etonian that Ian Fleming conceived of, with something “cruel in the mouth and cold in the eyes”.It is not as if we haven’t got enough leading ladies on screen these days, anyway. Just look at Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games, Villanelle from Killing Eve and Carol Danvers from the Marvel comics. In fact, I’d argue that we have always had great female role models in film, from Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley, to my own childhood hero, Margot Kidder’s Lois Lane.So while I wouldn’t agree with the MP who this week claimed that female actors taking on traditionally male parts such as the Doctor in Doctor Who is driving men to crime, I think he may have a point on male role models.Nick Fletcher, the Conservative MP for Don Valley, was pilloried by the Left for suggesting that “female replacements” in shows meant the only characters boys had to idolise were gangsters like the Krays or Tommy Shelby from Peaky Blinders.During a debate in parliament on International Men’s Day on Thursday, he said: “Look at the discussion around who will play the next James Bond. In recent years we have seen Doctor Who, Ghostbusters, Luke Skywalker, the Equaliser, all replaced by women. Is there any wonder we are seeing so many men committing crime?”Naturally, he was widely mocked online, with the Labour MP Ruth Cadbury saying: “After a decade in power it’s clear that this Government have ran out of ideas to tackle crime if they’re looking to blame Doctor Who,” and the SNP’s Stephen Flynn jibing: “Could certainly do with someone replacing Nick Fletcher.”Yet, as Mr Fletcher later clarified, the point he was trying to make – albeit clumsily – is that: “Boys and young men also need positive role models within the media, just as women do.”He added: “Teachers, parents and carers need to teach young men and boys that males can make a positive difference.”It is hard to argue with that. Part of the problem is that we are spending too much time depicting men as superheroes, wizards and death-defying super spies, rather than simply celebrating hero fathers.I can think of very few modern films or TV shows that celebrate fatherhood, except perhaps the comical Daddy’s Home movies starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. You have to go way back to the 1990s and early noughties to find properly paternal fare like Mr Mom, Parenthood, Mrs Doubtfire and Father of the Bride.It is as if fathers have somehow fallen out of fashion amid all this virtue signalling talk of “toxic masculinity” and “rape culture”.But if you really believe in equality, you have surely got to be a champion for men as much as women – and crucially for fathers as much as mothers.I couldn’t help but wonder, as Labour’s Stella Creasy this week paraded her newborn son around parliament in a call for equal maternity rights for MPs, what on earth the baby’s father was up to.What better example could there be of this policy in action than “Mr Creasy” providing the daddy day care, if even for one day only?Part of the problem here is that women are still automatically seen as the default parent, which not only places too much of the burden on mothers, but also devalues the contribution that fathers increasingly make to their children’s lives.Gone are the days of fathers coming home from a hard day’s work, dumping their briefcase at the door and asking “what’s for dinner?” without a thought for what the kids have been up to.Today, as increasing numbers of women have gone out to work, men share more of the domestic and childcare responsibilities than they ever have.So why aren’t we celebrating this, not least when we know how damaging fatherlessness can be to children?It isn’t just that boys need positive role models in the media – they need them in the home too. The number of families with a lone mother in the UK has risen by 18 per cent since 1996, according to the Office for National Statistics.Across Britain, 2.7 million children have no father figure at home, representing almost a fifth of all dependent children, according to the Centre for Social Justice think tank.It released a report in 2017 which found that children with absent fathers were 80 per cent more likely to be involved in antisocial behaviour and 75 per cent more likely to be involved in crime.I don’t quote these figures to stigmatise single parents – my husband and his two brothers were brought up by a lone mother when his father died when he was six. She, like many single mothers, did a phenomenal job.But we are deluding ourselves if we think fathers don’t have an enormously important role to play or that two parents aren’t preferable to one, regardless of what the “progressives” might argue.The statistics speak for themselves on this. When fathers are involved in their children’s early lives, children will score higher on measures of cognitive development by the age of five months. By the time they are toddlers, they will have better problem-solving abilities and at the age of three they will have higher IQ scores.Children with engaged fathers are also 28 per cent less likely to suffer from behavioural issues as young children than those without a father figure in their life.There is also a wealth factor to consider. There are 47 per cent of lone parent families living below the official “poverty line”, compared to 24 per cent of children in couple families.Yet you don’t hear many lads leaving school declaring that they aspire to become a house husband. Girls still admit to wanting to start a family – even in the post-feministic era of women’s empowerment – but boys, not so much, despite the advent of flexible working and paternity leave. This is a missed opportunity.If lockdown has taught us anything, it is the importance of the bond between fathers and their children. The Fatherhood Institute found that 78 per cent of dads reported spending more time with their children, while 65 per cent reported a better relationship with their children after the spring lockdown last year.Ninety five per cent of British adults think that a father is vital to a child’s wellbeing and yet there still pervades a narrative that isn’t just anti-family but anti-child rearing too.If it wasn’t bad enough that we have a narcissistic Instagram generation, brought up to think it’s all about “me, me, me”, they’re now being told that procreation is killing the planet.On the contrary, the most important thing in the world is family.More from NewsWinds of almost 100mph batter UK as Storm Arwen hitsVicky Ward: ‘What was Epstein telling me about Ghislaine?’Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Stephen Sondheim could break your heart and make you hear the world anewLockdowns \u0026#39are an abuse of power\u0026#39 – but the Left has \u0026#39paternalistic\u0026#39 obsession with themMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"easy cynical quietly making success brexit","story":"Sir Robert Peel once remarked that public opinion is a compound of folly, weakness, prejudice, wrong feeling, right feeling, obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs. I’m not so cynical, but any of us who followed the Brexit debate over the last few years could certainly see his views reflected in some of the downbeat corners of the media. All too often, the negative angle taken about our leaving the European Union can feel pessimistic, particularly for those of us who see it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to regain our nation’s sovereignty. Our successes are often denied the space they deserve, while challenges — real or imagined — are seized upon and blown up into headlines. For the first time in fifty years, the United Kingdom is an independent trading nation with a government answerable only to the British people. Any big change brings challenges, yes, but to focus solely on them is not only wrong, but means that our tangible successes don’t get a look-in.One area that often flies under the radar is the work we’re doing to open up markets all around the world, beyond trade deals.As we said when launching our Export Strategy last week, research shows firms that export are more productive, more profitable and pay higher wages on average than those that don’t. And there is, understandably, huge appetite for high-quality British goods and services worldwide, making it mutually beneficial. That’s why the Department for International Trade is working flat out to give British businesses the opportunity to sell their brilliant goods and services around the planet more easily than ever before — positioning us to take advantage of the markets of tomorrow and unleashing the UK\u0027s full potential.  That means cutting through unnecessary red tape and working with our trading partners across the world to set the conditions in which British businesses can thrive. This can be tricky, and it can take some time. But, for the country, it’s worth it.   Last year, we opened up access for major names like Diageo and Waitrose, as well as iconic Jersey dairy products and Scotch whisky. We clarified labelling requirements to achieve greater access to Jordan’s £2.5 billion food import market, and worked with Indian counterparts to increase permitted investment in their insurance market by a whopping 25 per cent, supporting British firms to grow their share of a market worth over £4 billion.  In Colombia, we worked with authorities to support development of ambitious environmental regulations that will support green investments from British firms. In Japan, we helped ensure British sausages could be marketed and sold appropriately.   The list goes on. I’m proud to say that figures published yesterday show we successfully resolved a total of 217 trade barriers across 74 countries – up 20 per cent on last year’s total. So much for the doubters, doomsters and gloomsters.  We must never forget just how much the UK has to offer as the world’s second largest services exporter and fifth largest economy. We have agreed trade deals with 70 countries — plus the EU — worth £766 billion. No other nation has secured so many trade deals with so many of its counterparts in such a short space of time. And this is just the beginning. We are making headway in dynamic economies around the world, and we have shaken hands on agreements with our good friends in Australia and New Zealand.   This paves the way for our accession to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (sometimes called CPTPP), a truly enormous free trade area with a combined GDP well in excess of £8 trillion last year. This Indo-Pacific tilt will hitch us to a fast-growing, dynamic region that we could do so much more with. We’re making great progress in our ground-breaking Digital Economy Agreement with Singapore. And we are preparing to begin trade negotiations with India, which is projected to be the world’s third largest economy by 2050.  The opportunities available to a newly independent United Kingdom are all but limitless. In charge of our own destiny, we will bulldoze more and more trade barriers, and sign even more deals in the years and decades to come, giving our brilliant British businesses the freedom to look beyond the horizon and seize the opportunities out there.Ranil Jayawardena MP is Minister for International TradeMore from NewsWinds of almost 100mph batter UK as Storm Arwen hitsVicky Ward: ‘What was Epstein telling me about Ghislaine?’Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Stephen Sondheim could break your heart and make you hear the world anewLockdowns \u0026#39are an abuse of power\u0026#39 – but the Left has \u0026#39paternalistic\u0026#39 obsession with themMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"get handle spending using traditional supermarket trolley say","story":"It is usually treats and offers surrounding supermarket checkouts that end up burning holes in our pockets – but now it has been revealed that shopping trolleys themselves could lead to us spending more.A study has found that removing the horizontal grip bar on trolleys and replacing it with handles like those on a wheelbarrow could lead to shoppers spending 25 per cent more.Researchers from City University of London\u0027s Bayes Business School and the University of Innsbruck, in Austria, tested a new trolley design based on psychological research.The research has proven that triceps activation is associated with rejecting things we don\u0027t like – for example when we push or hold something away from us – while biceps activation is associated with things we do like, for example when we pull or hold something close to our body.Prof Zachary Estes and Prof Mathias Streicher used the changed trolley design to survey 2,359 shoppers over three days. They discovered that people using it bought more products and spent 25 per cent more than those using standard trolleys.The findings indicate that retailers are likely to chalk up greater profits by providing customers with trolleys with parallel handles, while people are likely to exercise more control over their spending if they are using a standard trolley. The researchers have held talks about the findings with leading supermarket chains in Austria and the US.Prof Estes, a professor in marketing at Bayes Business School, said most shoppers had indicated that they preferred the standard trolley design but added: We don\u0027t know if that\u0027s just because they’re used to them.We think it\u0027s just a matter of being used to something and then, after one or two trips to the supermarkets with the new trolleys, people will just become accustomed to them and think they\u0027re normal and they won\u0027t be uncomfortable any more.The study is published in the Journal of Marketing.Prof Estes said: It is shocking to find that making a small change to the position of handles can have such a large impact on shoppers\u0027 spending.

It follows that if non-citizens can arrive illegally and then avail themselves of those rights, the interests of citizens are damaged. Democracy is thus damaged too. This – not racism – is the main reason why most voters hate illegal immigration.The influx of people by boat on to the south coast of England makes this illegality visible. Illegal immigration by other means has, in fact, fallen sharply, as has net migration. This is mainly because of Covid, partly because of Brexit, but also because, contrary to widespread belief, there has been effective co-operation between French and British about tunnel crossings. Until about two years ago, a farming neighbour tells me, it was commonplace for fruit lorries from the Continent to arrive at a Kent packhouse, open their doors and disgorge several stowaways who then ran away. No longer.Instead, the rickety boats come, in growing numbers. This week, as was eventually inevitable given the crowding and the heartlessness of the smugglers, one such boat sank, drowning almost all on board.We live about a dozen miles from the coast where such boats land. Friends who live closer sometimes watch the arrivals at Winchelsea Beach, Dungeness or Hastings, landings that are often assisted by the RNLI. They bear no ill will to the people seeking the opportunities that Britain offers. But they do feel oppressed by the sense of helplessness. One, a doctor, points out that if a comparable boat capsized in nearby waters, “30 severely hypothermic or half-drowned human beings appearing at once would overwhelm the hospital in a way that no wave of Covid has managed to do”. There is little preparation. An air of fatalism hangs over the whole subject of the boats, as if nothing can be done.The easiest, most enjoyable thing just now is to blame the French. Far be it from me to defend Emmanuel Macron. He is undoubtedly seeking electoral advantage in next year’s presidential election. But if you imagine the situations reversed, with us in Britain being lectured by France that we must not let illegal immigrants leave our shores for theirs, I think you can see how the French might feel.In the short term, with a lack of trust between Macron and Boris Johnson, made worse by No10’s strange decision to publish in advance the Prime Minister’s letter to the president about joint policing, the prospects of a joint approach are poor.Nevertheless, the true interests of both countries are closely aligned. Britain does not want the boats, of course, but nor does France. It is terrible for President Macron that this week’s drowning happened on his watch. It is also extremely unpleasant for the residents of northern France that Calais is a sort of fortress and that people smugglers infest their territory. Immigration is a considerably fiercer issue in French politics than in ours, highly damaging to Macron.If France agreed to let us turn the boats back – an agreement that would, admittedly, cost us a great deal of money – it would not be long before the business model of the smugglers collapsed and with it, their frightening sway. An unstated reason why French police sometimes just stand and watch as the boats load up on remote beaches is that they are heavily outnumbered and literally outgunned by the smugglers. Kill the trade, and all that goes.More widely, this is a European issue – and by “European”, I do not mean EU alone. We in Britain groan under the weight of asylum applications: one good aspect of the forthcoming, rather limited Nationality and Borders Bill is that it will pare down our absurdly extensive rights of asylum appeal. But both Germany and France have far bigger numbers of asylum seekers than we do and face a greater existential risk from trans-continental migration.The recent migrations into Poland laid on by Belarus (with Russian backing) are not far short of undeclared war. Non-European migrants have been press-ganged, sometimes even flown in, to attempt mass incursions there. Western Europeans well understand that this is a hostile political act, not a spontaneous movement of refugees, and are co-operating to resist it. Britain, for instance, is contributing engineers to Poland to help reinforce physical borders.In the Channel, there is no comparable plot by a nation or nations to invade us with a conscript army of the wretched of the earth, but there is a situation that is politically dangerous to Western democracy. Borders define rights, responsibilities and jurisdictions. If those borders are not upheld, those rights and responsibilities are undermined, and jurisdictions become blurred. This gives advantage to bad actors, such as people smugglers and Islamist terrorists.This blurring of jurisdictions began in the 1970s and became much more apparent in our Continent, first after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and later with mass movements from disturbed parts of the Muslim world and Africa. The people most responsible for this have been judges, and the “human rights” lawyers for whom this has become a big industry.In an interesting study – titled Immigration, Strasbourg and Judicial Overreach – published by the think tank Policy Exchange earlier this year, Professor John Finnis, the distinguished legal philosopher, and Simon Murray, a barrister practising in the immigration field, explained what has gone wrong with “human rights”.To avoid renewing the horrors of the Second World War, the victors, with Britain playing the leading role, drew up the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in 1950. With similar aims, the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees was signed the following year.Finnis and Murray argue that the original documents understood their limits. Their authors sensed danger if rights were too absolute for sovereign states to handle. Thus they contained no obligation to let in refugees if they arrived at borders en masse, no legal (as opposed to moral) obligation to accept refugees at all and no absolute obligation to provide refuge to asylum seekers who were a danger to the community.Many years later, however, judges began to develop the doctrine that the ECHR is a “living instrument” – a lawyer’s way of saying that judges are free to make it mean whatever they think the spirit of the age demands. They used this latitude to expand enormously all the definitions – what is meant, for example, by the right to privacy and family life in Article 8.Gradually, their judgments incentivised illegal immigration because they meant that, once you got into the country of your choice, no one could get you out. In Britain, Tony Blair gold-plated the “living instrument”, turning the ECHR into our Human Rights Act.So there is co-operation, in effect – though not, of course, in intention – between the judges and the people smugglers. The former give illegal immigrants a get-out-of-jail-free card, and the latter, for large sums of money, get them where they want to be.As Finnis and Murray put it, this liberal interpretation of rights “incoherently privileges preventing risks to non-citizens over risks to citizens”.That, unfortunately, is where we are. It is pretty much where we shall remain unless we in Britain – and preferably the entire free world – decide the law should respect the borders and wishes of democracies instead of disregarding them.The task of reining back judicial overreach is similar to the “taking back control” sought by Brexit. So far, our leaders have lacked the stomach for it.More from NewsWinds of almost 100mph batter UK as Storm Arwen hitsVicky Ward: ‘What was Epstein telling me about Ghislaine?’Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Stephen Sondheim could break your heart and make you hear the world anewLockdowns \u0026#39are an abuse of power\u0026#39 – but the Left has \u0026#39paternalistic\u0026#39 obsession with themMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"need take back lives permanent covid panic mongers","story":"So we’re back here again. We’re heading into Christmas. Families are planning to gather. The worst appears to be behind us.Then a new Covid variant emerges. Government rhetoric shifts. The variant is “of huge concern”, ministers declare, and “we must act with caution”. There’s an immediate travel ban, once again turning thousands of families’ lives upside-down to no obvious purpose. Labour calls ardently for “mask-wearing in public places”. Senior scientists start telling people to get ready to go backwards, away from normality.But there’s a difference this time: we are not sitting ducks. This country has just implemented an unprecedented mass vaccination programme. The vast majority of people have some sort of immunity, and most of the vulnerable have recently had a booster shot.Yet, somehow, we are still in “do something!” mode. At the first sign of trouble, the calls for lockdowns, restrictions and vaccine passports rise to a clamour. Journalists fill press conferences with endless rounds of questions about why we aren’t “doing more”. The question of when exactly we plan to return to a normal level of risk appetite goes unasked, let alone answered.The forever-lockdown crowd have some points on their side, as they always do. We don’t know much about the latest variant. It has a lot more mutations than prior ones, they say, and might be even more transmissible. We don’t know if it’s deadlier or milder. We don’t know whether it will escape our vaccines more easily or not. It could all be a disaster, the end of the world, the wave to end all waves. Or not.There are some things we do know, however. We know that new variants are now a permanent fact of life. We know that they will find their way here with or without these pointless “travel bans”. We know that fast-spreading variants will soon, like others before them, become endemic. We know that we have seven vaccines and counting in our arsenal.We also have strong evidence that this country is now highly resistant to Covid. More than 80 per cent of Britons over 12 have had two vaccine doses, 28 per cent have had three and up to 14 per cent are thought to have caught the virus since July.The recent wave, which was really more of a ripple, failed to raise death rates or hospitalisations to anything like the levels seen at the peak last January. Then it began to subside, even before the booster programme had reached all of the vulnerable. Professor Lockdown himself, Neil Ferguson, thinks we might be “almost at herd immunity”.Meanwhile, we have limited evidence that measures other than vaccines actually achieve very much. Scotland still requires widespread mask-wearing, yet its case rate rose higher than England’s this autumn. October cases peaked more than a week before school half terms, suggesting school breaks weren’t the reason for the ebb.Total lockdowns, of the kind seen in March last year, do seem to work, but they also destroy society. And the Sweden debate rumbles on: the country that never locked down and experienced death rates far higher than its Nordic neighbours, but far lower than ours.Yet even before Thursday’s news about the latest variant, the bureaucratic, lazy and risk-averse were threatening everyone with their procedures and precautions. While most of life has managed to return to some semblance of normality, state-run institutions have been struggling to emerge from the Covid bubble.Every new headline is an excuse for unions to moan that working isn’t “safe”. Thousands of public sector workers are still sitting at home, depressing productivity, soaking up buckets of fresh public spending and choking the economy (just think of the DVLA lorry licence backlog). All sorts of places, like public museums, still try to demand mask-wearing, even though the law doesn’t. The administrative burden and expense attached to flying abroad have multiplied with no end in sight.Schools are among the most prolific spreaders of Covid safety-ism, when they should be the ones fighting hardest against it for the sake of their students. Bans on shaking hands, masking, cancelled nativity plays, draconian sickness policies: everything must still operate in the shadow of the virus.Worst of all, as The  reported this week, some schools have even taken it upon themselves to impose “circuit breaks” – week-long “online learning” snooze-fests in which the teachers sit around at home while their pupils fall further and further behind. Such closures should be illegal.Instead, with news of this variant, these sorts of measures are going to spread. Just when it looked like the Government was being proven right about giving us back our freedoms and resisting Europe’s fresh lockdown fever, the proponents of never-ending Covid panic have regained the initiative. They want to show that liberty can still be suspended at a moment’s notice and society can still be put in the freezer.It’s already clear that certain aspects of life will never return to normal. We’ll be carrying crumpled up masks in our pockets for years. Travellers will forever be forced to file dissertations of unnecessary paperwork in order to fly anywhere and in many countries will have to show proof of vaccination. Sticking a swab up your nose every so often will simply be a part of life from now on. These things are dismal, but inevitable.What we cannot accept, however, is that our basic freedoms are now just loans that can be called in at any time. Free societies do not require their citizens to get new vaccines every year in order to live a normal life. They do not allow teachers to shut down schools at the drop of a hat. They do not suspend Christmas or close offices or ban drinking every time something unusual pops up in a laboratory somewhere.Last year, as the country entered its third and most depressing lockdown over Christmas, politicians supporting the restrictions promised us that liberation was just around the corner. “Let’s not fall at the last hurdle,” they said. “The vaccine is here!” they said. “Just wait for the rollout and then enjoy your freedoms.”Well, the rollout has happened. The virus is still out there, evolving, and it’s going to keep evolving forever. This is as good as it’s going to get. So we need to know when and how we will switch from “Covid mode” back to “normal life”. With so many panic-mongers resisting the change, it won’t happen without a fight. We need to know the Government actually wants to win it.Have we lost the plot? Interpol, the international policing agency, has just elected a new Chinese official to its executive committee after the last guy, an official named Meng Hongwei, was literally disappeared by the Chinese state. There is no symbol that better represents the state of the world’s governance organisations.Interpol helps its 195 member countries to share policing information and issues cross-border arrest warrants for iniduals they want to nab. One of its four founding principles is “respect for human rights”. But authoritarian regimes have found that it’s an excellent vehicle for hunting down dissident and ethnic minority targets who have slipped through their fingers.In recent years, China has stepped up its use of Interpol to pursue democracy activists, government critics and prominent members of groups it wants to exterminate. Xi Jinping has launched two campaigns, called “Fox Hunt” and “Sky Net”, whose aims are to sweep up and extradite critics of his regime abroad. Research by the human rights group Safeguard Defenders shows that Chinese state media have boasted that Interpol tools are being used in nearly 3,000 cases as part of these campaigns.The farcical case of Meng and his replacement shows how easy we make it for Beijing. In 2018, Meng, the chief of Interpol, took a trip back to China – and never returned. Yet here we are three years later and Beijing has a new official on Interpol’s executive committee. Have you disappeared your own official? Never mind! Send another one!Democratic countries provide more than 60 per cent of the funding for Interpol, yet as usual we have rendered ourselves procedurally impotent, having diffused voting power among the organisation’s many member states.Still, there are levers we could pull. Dozens of parliamentarians in the International Parliamentary Alliance on China wrote a letter in opposition to China’s plans to get its official on to Interpol’s committee. Where was the campaign at government level? And what are Interpol’s biggest funders doing to ensure that its practices follow its legal commitment to political neutrality and human rights? Interpol recently introduced a code of conduct and began reforms that it says will “ensure greater transparency”. Its critics are sceptical.Recently, Meng’s wife, Grace, who lives in France with their children, spoke publicly for the first time about how she fears the long arm of Beijing. This power is being amplified by bodies like Interpol. And through them, democracies, rather than hindering this activity, are aiding and abetting it.The world recently had a taste of how the Chinese “disappearing” system works. Peng Shuai is not a typical government critic. She is a tennis player with a network and fan base across the globe. Still, when she spoke out about being sexually abused by a senior retired Communist Party official called Zhang Gaoli, she was quickly and effectively silenced.First, the regime deleted her blog post. Then she disappeared from view for days. Then she reappeared smiling, attending official events, going to dinner with “friends” (including several unsmiling, official-looking men) and even held a half-hour phone -call with Olympic bureaucrats, who afterwards declared her to be “fine”.Had Peng known about the hell raised abroad by her friends and foreign governments, she might have concluded that her best chance of escaping China and the lifetime of surveillance, gagging and control now awaiting her would be to stick to her guns. But she was presumably kept in the dark. Pressure must have been applied to secure her co-operation. The usual method would be to take family members hostage. Thus, with the help of the Olympic apparatus Beijing neutralised a PR nightmare.Last week, I commented that China and other authoritarian regimes keep making mistakes. This week, craven international organisations established and supported by the West bailed China out of its own mess.

Dr Tony Sewell’s Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities similarly recommended that it no longer be used earlier this year. His argument was that it is increasingly irrelevant. As the NHS Race and Health Observatory correctly identified, it “crudely conflates” very different sets of people. Interestingly, that organisation’s survey and focus groups found that the term was also deeply unpopular, including among the people it is supposedly meant to benefit.I’m not surprised, because BAME a bizarre idea on many counts. First, it makes very little sense in practical terms to treat these groups as indistinguishable. Some ethnic minorities tend to do much better at school than others, for example. There are many areas in our society in which Black African people attain far better outcomes than both Black Caribbean and White British people.Even in public health, BAME makes little sense and it could even be said to be harmful. When it comes to collecting data for medical purposes, for example, an issue that predominantly affects Black Afro-Caribbean people, such as sickle cell anaemia, may be far less relevant to people from an Indian or Pakistani background.But there are other problems with BAME, not least the fact that it is demeaning to ethnic minority people. Non-white people are defined not as iniduals, nor even by their own particular backgrounds. The BAME mantra actively erases both of those. If you are labelled BAME, it means that you are only seen through the prism of the fact that you aren’t white.It is also ideological. I would argue that it is part of the same toxic theory that has brought us “white privilege” and “hierachies of oppression”. Too often, it is used to support the dangerous idea that some people are always at a disadvantage because they happen to have a particular skin colour, while others always benefit because of theirs.Unfortunately BAME – and other terms used to refer to ethnic minority people as some sort of bloc – are still widespread in public bodies and businesses. The Church of England even seems to have invented its own term, UKME – United Kingdom Minority Ethnic.But if public bodies truly want to address racial inequalities, they need to start looking at different demographics in more detail. And if social justice actually does mean addressing inequality, surely all inequalities must be observed, including the poor outcomes faced by white working class people?BAME is a particularly problematic term when it comes to mixed race people like me. We tend to be lumped into the BAME bracket by default for not being entirely white, thus disregarding half of our heritage, ethnicity and culture. But why should anyone have to choose a camp when they belong to both?Certainly, there is racism in the UK that needs to be stamped out. But as Sewell argued so powerfully in his report, this is not an institutionally racist country and non-white people do not constantly need to be told that they are at a disadvantage. So yes, scrap BAME. Better yet, how about we try treating people as iniduals and leave the labels out of it entirely?More from NewsWinds of almost 100mph batter UK as Storm Arwen hitsVicky Ward: ‘What was Epstein telling me about Ghislaine?’Saturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Stephen Sondheim could break your heart and make you hear the world anewLockdowns \u0026#39are an abuse of power\u0026#39 – but the Left has \u0026#39paternalistic\u0026#39 obsession with themMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saturday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Saturday.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps insisted people should be able to get together this Christmas - and said festive celebrations in schools should be allowed.It comes amid reports some schools have banned parents from attending nativity plays or festive celebrations in person due to concerns about the virus.The emergence of a worrying new iant in South Africa, Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel has sparked alarm among experts, with flights suspended from six southern African countries.No cases have been detected in the UK so far but UK Health Security Agencyboss Dr Susan Hopkins said it was possible the strain was already here. Askedschools should be allowed to stage nativity plays, Mr Shapps told LBC: Let nativity plays play on is my view. We did not go through two, now three rounds of vaccination and everything  to have to live out last Christmas again when we werenapost able to get together as we should have done, in the numbers we should have done, with our friends and families.  So of course steps will be taken no doubt to make them as safe as possible, ventilation and the rest of it. Yes people should be able to get together. Downing Street said it was a matter for inidual schools to decide. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “We have set out our guidance to schools that states that they can continue to hold events where visitors such as parents are on site, which includes things like school plays and our guidance is clear - there’s no limit on group size of these events, either indoor or outdoor.” It comes after Schools Minister Robin Walker said end-of-term shows and nativity plays were an important tradition as he urged teachers to allow them to go ahead in person. He told PA: I want to see schools continuing to engage with parents in as constructive a way as they possibly can. Of course where they can go ahead safely, things like nativity plays and end-of-term shows are really important and a good way of doing that. I would want to see as many going forward as possible. Askedit was wrong for schools to axe in-person festive events, Mr Walker said: I think itaposs good where those important traditions can be maintained that they are. But he added: Of course I understand there will be schools that feel that they have to take extra precautions and particularly when itaposs about adults coming into a school and they need to be able to look at their local circumstances. They need to be able to work with the local directors of public health who will have a feel for the local situation. And I respect that thataposs going to be dferent in dferent parts of the country.  James Bowen, director of policy for NAHT, said: School nativities are a special occasion for pupils, parents and staff. There is nothing schools want more than to have a hall full of families enjoying the children putting on their festive show. However, schools have so many things to balance when deciding what to do this year. They are dealing with ying advice from their local authorities, central government advice, and a wide range of parent opinions - they really are caught between a rock and a hard place. Schools will be listening carefully to the advice being given by the public health teams and local authorities and putting the appropriate measures in place based on that advice. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said Christmas activities were an important part of school le but Covid related issues remain.Leaders will, however, be realistic about the signicant challenges they continue to face in tackling the disruption to normal school le brought by the coronavirus and will try to be flexible in managing the risks presented by bringing family members into the school environment to attend performances, he said.They will also be mindful of the challenges posed by having more staff absent than normal. Some may, reluctantly, decide to cancel shows but the technology that has played such a vital role in education during the pandemic also offers schools the opportunity to stage virtual performances. Whilst this is no replacement for watching young people performing in person, it does mean that the show can go on for many schools.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there is “huge international concern” surrounding the strain after banning flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia to limit its spread.With Moderna “rapidly advancing” a booster jab to combat Omicron, Mr Javid told MPs there are concerns the iant may be more transmissible, make existing vaccines less effective and may hinder one of the UK’s Covid treatments, Ronapreve.  Ministers were facing calls to impose tougher restrictions to prevent a wave of the new iant arriving in Britain while a Delta surge is ongoing, as Belgium became the first EU country to announce a case. Professor John Edmunds, who advises the Government as part of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , warned that could create a “very, very, very dficult situation”.Ministers were considering adding two more countries to the travel aposred listapos on Friday night, the Daily Mail reported.A government adviser suggested Brits should be ready for the possibility of ato Covid restrictions. However, a senior government source told the newspaper that people should not panic.  In the Netherlands, health officials said dozens of people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday are likely infected with Covid-. They were conducting further testing to seepeople are infected with the recently discovered Omicron iant. Dutch officials estimated that  of about  passengers had Covid. Omicron was first discovered in South Africa and has been designated a “iant of concern” by the World Health Organisation . Senior UK scientists had previously described it as the aposworst everapos Covid iant detected so far. The WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the iant, which the organisation named Omicron, has an increased risk of reinfection and may sp rapidly than other strains. The EU, US and Canada all followed Britain’s move to impose travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa ahead of the WHO adding the strain, also known as B..., to its highest category for concerning iants. Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an “increased risk of reinfection” and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a “growth advantage”. No cases have been detected in the UK but its arrival in Belgium – after being found in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel – has heightened concerns. Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the Rega Institute in Belgium, said a sample was confirmed as the iant in a traveller who ed from Egypt on November  before first showing symptoms  days later. The six African countries were added to the UK’s travel red list on Thursday evening and passengers arriving in the UK from these countries from am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a Government-approved hotel quarantine for  days. Downing Street urged anyone who has arrived from those countries recently to get tested. Mr Javid said discussions are ongoing over the prospect of adding further countries to the red list, telling the Commons the Government “won’t hesitate to actwe need to do so”. Mr Johnson held a call with South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday afternoon after foreign minister Naledi Pandor said the flight ban “seems to have been rushed”. The Prime Minister “commended South Africa’s rapid genomic sequencing” and its “leadership in transparently sharing scientic data”, Downing Street said. “They discussed the challenges posed globally by the new Covid- iant and ways to work together to deal with it and reopen international travel,” a statement said. Prof Edmunds said the new strain “is a huge worry” and that “all the data suggests” it would be able to evade current immunity.“Our fears are it would do so to a large extent,” he told BBC Radio ’s PM programme.Prof Edmunds urged ministers to look at extending travel restrictions and to prepare a plan to deal with Omicron because “at some point we’re going to get this iant here in the UK”.  He suggested mass testing and local restrictions must be looked at while other preparations could include making the booster programme more rapid, perhaps by reducing the gap between second and third doses, and widening it to younger age groups. “Even the vaccines don’t work particularly well against this new iant, they do against Delta, and we’re still fighting a Delta wave and we certainly don’t want to be fighting both at the same time,” he said. “There are things we can do and we need to get on with it very rapidly.” The Government said as of am on Friday, there had been a further , lab-confirmed Covid- cases in the UK, the highest reported daily figure since October . It also said a further  people had died within  days of testing positive for Covid- as of Friday, bringing the UK total to ,. South African scientists fear the iant is behind a dramatic rise in cases in some regions, including Gauteng province, which includes the cities of Pretoria and Johannesburg. Pfizer BioNTech, which has produced a vaccine against Covid-, is already studying the new iant’s ability to evade vaccines. Experts have said vaccines can be tweaked to tackle new iants as they emerge.

Just to say, @BootsUK — this was a very big error on your part. Totally tone deaf, she said.  Boots said the offer is % off all men’s and women’s healthcare services, not just on contraceptive pills. Black Friday is the Friday following Thanksgiving in the United States. It traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season across the US and United Kingdom. Many companies try to capitalise on the Christmas rush by offering deals on goods and services, but Boots are taking heat for the fact that it is a highly sensitive health service they are offering up a deal on.On the Online Doctor page it says: Get emergency contraceptionyou’ve had unprotected sex and want to prevent pregnancy.  Use the code BLACKFRIDAY at checkout to get % off your order!! No chargewe canapost help. Wow yeh I just threw up a bit, wrote one woman in response to the tweet, which has so far garnered close to , likes and retweets. Wow that makes me sad…. another person added, whilst a third said: Christ this is so grim. People also took issue with the wording of the deal. aposNo chargewe can’t helpapos is also weirdly grim, wrote one woman.  In July , Boots defended its refusal to charge less for the morning after pill by saying that doing so would leave it open to being accused of “incentivising inappropriate use”. A month later it had started to sell a new, cheaper generic version of the pill in  of its stores, climbing to , by October that year. “We have listened to our customers’ feedback, they said. A spokesperson at Boots said about the Black Friday deal: “This is a promotion running on our Online Doctor service. The offer is % off all men’s and women’s healthcare services.” Boots Online Doctor services for men’s health include treatment for conditions like erectile dys, hair loss and premature ejaculation. Alongside the morning after pill, the Boots Online Doctor services for women’s health include facial hair removal treatment, period pain relief and vaginal dryness treatment. The Boots Online Doctor services can provide quick access to advice and prescription-only medicine without having to see a GP, the company added.

Hannah Pawley was fired from Hanleyaposs Restaurant, Drfield, Yorkshire, after taking time off to recover.The restaurant, run by head chef Sean Hanley, refused to pay her the statutory sick leave which she was legally entitled to whilst she was off work following the ectopic pregnancy. A tribunal ruled in her favour and she has won £, following a two-year legal battle.The woman was awarded the sum for her sick pay and potential lost earnings.  Leeds Employment Tribunal also found that the employer falsied records to hide the fact that she wasnapost being remunerated, which left Hannah unable to claim benefits. Hannah, who has since had a baby and started a homemade food delivery service, said: I felt used and betrayed by my employer Sean Hanley. I asked for my monies owed and a valid reason for firing me. As he couldnapost provide one, I felt I had no other option but to bring my case forward to ACAS [the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service] and fight. Even at my most broken and vulnerable point, I felt I had to fight for this gross wrongdoing.  Hannah had been working for Hanleyaposs Restaurant for five months and as a chef for four years in the lead up to her dismissal. But in November , she suffered an ectopic pregnancy and had to take sick leave as she was unwell and had to cope with strong medical treatment. Hannahaposs leave was certied as pregnancy-related sickness. According to the law, she was entitled to take as much leave as necessary without any detriment to her employment. In addition, her employer had been informed that she had experienced an ectopic pregnancy and needed time to physically recover. Speaking after the ruling, Hannah said it was a relief to finally get justice. She added: The relief to know that it has been officially recognised and noted that I was treated poorly is hugely healing. I hope this is not only a warning to employers but a big plus to any women who feel they have been wronged. If it feels wrong - it probably is.

Taryn Robinson, from charity Pregnant Then Screwed, who advised Hannah following her sacking, said it was time to end penalties incurred by women following motherhood. She said: At Pregnant Then Screwed we hear of women being forced out of their jobs following a miscarriage time and time again. Sadly, these women rarely use the law to access the justice they deserve as they simply donapost have the emotional energy. Employers need to do so much better to ensure their workplaces are fair and safe environments for everyone. There is a national conversation taking place about the importance of progressive reproductive health-related policies Cases like Hannahaposs show the negative impact that a lack of support and protection can have on women and their careers.

Unless they’re popping in to let their colleagues have a cuddle with their newborns, parents don’t take their babies into work.MP Stella Creasy had other ideas. On Tuesday she took her three-month-old son to a debate in Westminster Hall. Much to her fury she was told this isn’t allowed. She immediately took to Twitter to complain, saying: “Apparently Parliament has a written rule which means I can’t take my well behaved -month-old, sleeping baby when I speak in the chamber... Mothers in the mother of all parliament are not to be seen or heard it seems…” Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has asked for the rules to be reviewed and said it was “extremely important” for all parents to participate in the House. He did, however, point out they have a nursery. Many people, me included, can’t understand why Stella took her baby in at all  Was it to get a pic for Instagram She says she had to come in because, as an MP, while she’s entitled to maternity leave, she doesn’t have anyone covering her role to the detriment of her constituents.But as an MP on £, a year, couldn’t she get a baby-sitter  She can’t have it both ways. No one  does. Not the bus driver, police officer or shop worker. And they earn nowhere near £,.  As a working mum myself, I welcome all conversations about improving work for mothers. But unlike Stella, most of us working mums don’t have the luxury of being able to pick and choose when we bring our children to work. Most of us juggle work with the lion’s share of ­childcare and we do it without grand gestures or wanting a medal. The rules of the Commons are peculiar, but they only affect a handful of women. Meanwhile the UK still has the third highest childcare costs for wealthy countries, according to the OECD. Some mothers don’t go back to work while their children are little because it’s so expensive. Others have no choice. So while it’s important for Stella to take a stand in her little corner of the world, it would be greatshe could go beyond Westminster on this one.

Marianne Fraser and fiance William brought the puppy, Thor, from a breeder on October  but they claim he started to act aggressively after a week. He began to regularly attack Marianne by locking onto her legs and biting and in the end the couple were forced to give up the dog, it is alleged. Images show Marianneaposs legs with severe bruising and, she says, bite marks from the German shepherd-Belgian Malinois cross who allegedly had serious behavioural issues.  Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror The couple said the dog had come from Fawnnest Kennels in Lockerbie, Scotland, and William told the MailOnline how they saw a dramatic change in its behaviour after a week. He started to challenge Marianne, locking on and not letting go, then the biting started. After couple of days, he got worse and it resulted in Marianne endlessly being attacked and her face being hurt, William said. Thor was picked up by Julie Nevett who runs a rescue centre which specialises in retraining pups for military or police purposes.She wrote on Facebook how she had received another dog from the same litter, which she named Thor , due to similar behavioural problems and was critical of the breeder.  I feel dreadful for both owners, not only have they lost a signicant amount of money and their puppy, they have quite serious injuries. I b****y hope the breeders are suitably ashamed of themselves. In an update, she insisted that the dogs are not pet pups but rather working line pups whose nature needs to be channelled appropriately and she rubbished the idea that either dog needs to be put down.  Replying to her first post, one person claimed that a friend had bought a German Shepherd from the same breeder which turned out to be riddled with problems. William has since said heaposs contacted the SPCA and his local council over the kennels who he claims have offered to refund the money in exchange for having the puppy back. He added: Itaposs not about the money - itaposs about the pup and what they have done.This is not Thor the pupaposs fault as they have obviously been kept as wild animals. I just want people to know there are two of the same pack there.

Bryony Cude, , and a group of friends bought three chicken kormas as part of a £ order from Ali Raj Indian restaurant. The teen says they waited  minutes and claimed the meal arrived noticeably undercooked.When they rang the restaurant to ask for a refund, their request was refused, DevonLive reports. Owner and chef Shafique Uddin insist the chicken was not raw and that it was discoloured. He even accused the girls of playing a practical joke and smoking or drinking when they insisted on having their money back.  Bryonyaposs father Simon Cude, from Cullompton, said: My daughter and a few of her friends got together for one of the girlaposs birthdays and instead of going out like normal teenagers they decided to have a girls night with a takeaway. They ordered the food they wanted and paid for this out of their own money - which they have earnt doing work for dferent places. They waited for over an hour for the food to arrive which they understood with takeaway’s being busy on a Saturday night. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.When the food arrived it was stone cold so the girls were fine with that and reheated it in a microwave, only to discover that the food wasn’t cooked properly and the chicken was raw. Simon said the group then called the restaurant and after a -minute conversation a driver came back to pick up the chicken and bring it back to the restaurant for inspection. The girls later received a phone call to tell them the chicken was not raw. He said: They called Ali Raj Takeaway and explained the food wasn’t cooked and askedthey could have either a replacement for the food or a refund - this was refused point-blank saying the girls had probably been smoking or been drinking. He then demanded to pick up the uncooked chicken by one of his drivers, which he did and then told the girls there was nothing wrong with it and they will not be getting any refund or replacement food. As you can imagine a small party of girls who choose to have a night in instead of being out and about with other friends was ruined. I think the way that he handled the situation and the way he had spoken to the girls was just as bad as the food. Ali Raj Indian Restaurant has since been contacted to respond to the claims and confirm that the curry in the images is theirs.  Owner and Chef Shafique Uddin, said: We served over  chicken kormas,the chicken was going to be raw I should have got inundated with complaints because we pre-cook the chicken and we serve it in the evening. I said Iaposll send a driver over and he can pick up the dish and we can check it ourselves, so we sent the driver over and he picked up the chicken and I looked at it, they actually put it in pieces - ripped the chicken all up. I saw the chicken but it wasnapost raw, you know sometimes when you get coloured bits, it is not all going to be white, thereaposs going to be a dark patch. Whenever you cook that chicken the dark patch gets even darker but they assumed it was raw and I kept telling them it is not raw - my driver ate the chicken. I said I can give you a chicken korma next time and she said aposoh no we want our full refundapos and I said I canapost do that because the chickenaposs not raw in the first place. That piece is brown - not all chicken breasts are going to be white. When askedhe asked Bryonyshe had been drinking or smoking he said: Yeah I did say that because our conversation went on for over  minutes. I thought they must have been a little bit drunk or something because theyaposre not listening to me. I said is this a prank call she said aposnoapos and I said well it sounds like it because all you want is a full refund. I said the chicken isnapost raw so I canapost give you a full refund - Iaposve got nothing to hide.

Jodie Weston - who supported Idris Elba at a gig last weekend - also said some drivers have even texted her afterwards because theyaposve saved her number.The -year-old told The Daily Star that she has become numb” to men sexually harassing her when she’s working in nightclubs.The Rich Kids Go Skint personality said: “It’s not right but it is the le of a woman. It is hard to be a woman and it’s not OK. “It’s really bad and it’s bad that you become numb to it because it happens so often. I do think the world is changing but it’s not quite there yet. “I’ve had taxi drivers ask methey can come back to mine with me. They also try to text me afterwards because they have my number from the booking.” Jodie - who also played at London’s Ministry of Sound last month - said she often brings male friends to avoid harassment. She explained: “I get a lot of inappropriate comments for how I dress. I’m not wearing turtle necks, I like being a woman and I like being sexy. “I enjoy embracing my figure. I like to DJ wearing glamorous clothes but I get a lot of hate from that. “I often take a male friend with me DJing just so people think it’s a boyfriend even though it’s just a friend. “I usually have at least one male friend with me to make sure nothing untoward happens.” Jodie also told about how she was groped and bitten in a frightening attack two years ago in East London as she was on her way to one of her gigs. Jodie, who hosts a radio show called The Dollhouse Show on Flex FM, says she is still targeted by trolls despite her success. She said: “I have had so many trolls saying I must dress down to cover a lack of talent.“Usually they are people who have never been to a gig. They look at my Instagram and make assumptions about me, it’s mainly men but I do get it from girls too which is annoying.”She admits that the cruel comments do upset her but they have also driven her to be successful. She added: “I’ve always had a fighter mindset and I even had family members tell me I wouldn’t make it as a DJ but it gives me fuel to prove people wrong.  Being a reality show star won’t help you when you’re playing at high-end venues like Ministry of Sound, it will make you have to prove yourself ten times moreanything. “I’ve had to prove I have the talent. When I was doing reality shows and first starting DJing I got trolls coming at me every single day. She added: “People would say ‘oh you think you’re a DJ ha ha ha what a joke’. “Now there is less of that because the proof is in the pudding - although I do still get them. “But I always keep on going, push past people, tell me no, and look at me now.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Ministry of SoundIdris ElbaReality shows\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Katie told OK! : Eugenie and Jack are very close to Harry and Meghan.Itaposs actually one of the few close relationships Harry and Meghan have retained in the royal family. It appears that the bond between Harry and Eugenie has been a long-shared one that goes way back to when they were children.Both their mothers, the late Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson, were close friends, who spent a lot of time together. They even went on holiday together with the children also tagging along, forming the basis of the bond.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. As they grew older, the royal cousins hit the London club scene together and they were regulars at the popular London club, Mahiki, sneaking in the back entrance. Insiders say that of all of the Queenaposs grandchildren, Harry and Eugenie had the most natural connections and are the closest of friends. In their book Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claim Harry and Eugenieaposs roles within the royal family was the base of their close relationship.  They write: Like Harry, Eugenie also struggled to carve out her own identity growing up. Not being in a senior role meant that she had to go out into the world and find her own path, which she has done, moving to New York in  to work at Paddle, the auction house run by Mishaaposs husband and Harryaposs friend Alexander. Harry had always confided in his cousin when it came to the women in his le. Not only did he trust her implicitly, but friends say that she gives great advice and has always been beyond wise for her years.  And due to this bond, Eugenie was one of the first people Harry told about Meghan, and he was keen to introduce them. Eugenie reportedly told a friend Meghan was just the tonic for her cousin.More recently, since Harryaposs move away from the UK to Calornia, he and Meghan allowed Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank to live in Frogmore Cottage at Windsor.In fact, when Harry travelled back to the UK for Prince Philipaposs funeral and for the unveiling of the Princess Diana statue, he is said to have isolated at Frogmore Cottage with Eugenie and Jack, who have a young son named August, due to Covid-related travel restrictions. Recently, Eugenie spoke out about her cousin, saying she wouldn’t presume to give advice to Harry and Meghan, except to say to be happy.And when Harry and Meghan announced the birth of their daughter Lilibet in June, Eugenie took to Instagram to congratulate her dear cousins.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleRoyal FamilyPrincess Eugenie\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Speaking in a documentary to mark the Queenaposs th birthday, Kate revealed what the thoughtful gt was.  She explained: I can remember being at Sandringham, for the first time, at Christmas. And I was worried what to give the Queen as her Christmas present. “I was thinking, aposGosh, what should I give her apos I thought back to what I would give my own grandparents. And I thought, aposIaposll make her something,apos which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my grannyaposs recipe for chutney.

Tony Hickmott, now  was supposed to be released eight years ago, yet he remains in hospital care. Mr Hickmott, from Brighton, is thought to be one of the longest-held patients in a secure unit in the UK.His parents Pam, , and Roy,  were finally able to tell Tonyaposs story after a gagging order was overturned by Sky News and the BBC.They are fighting for him to be able to live in the community with his own carers, something all of the agencies involved in his care agree is the best thing for him.  However, authorities claim that they are unable to find him somewhere suitable to live. Mum Pam said: Itaposs ruined our lives. Absolutely ruined our lives, Tonyaposs le. Heaposs spent half of his le in an institution. She added: I mean, my son isnapost dangerous, heaposs never hurt anybody. Tony deserves to come home because thataposs all he lives for. Pam says that the hospital aposisnapost the right place for himapos, and that he son is being kept in a unit that is similar to a aposlock and key.apos In , the Court of Protection began to look for somewhere for Tony to live in the community, but this has not materialised leaving Pam and Roy aposheartbrokenapos. Tony spending  years in detention has had a huge impact on the whole family. Pam says that they aposdonapost smile anymoreapos, and the emotional turmoil that Tonyaposs institutionalisation has left them in has meant they have aposgiven up.apos His dad, Roy, said he becomes overwhelmed with emotions when he goes to visit his son. Driving half way home I pull in and Iaposm sitting there crying, Roy told the broadcaster through tears. I mean I hate to say it - I sit there crying. For all the misery itaposs caused. I just think of Tone sitting there on his own. He added: I just canapost do another winter. Iaposm not coping. Iaposve had it. Iaposm at the end. Not having Tony around is dficult for his parents, and Roy says he becomes the most upset when he is having dinner with Pam. When Iaposm sitting at that table eating a big dinner, a nice dinner cooked well and Tonyaposs down there. Iaposd like to take my dinner down to him and give him it. Under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Article , all those with a disability are entitled to an apos inherent right to le and shall take all necessary measures to ensure its effective enjoyment... on an equal basis with others.apos They are also entitled to a right to aposl iving independently and being included in the communityapos with apos appropriate measures to facilitate full enjoymentapos as s per Article .Article  says that all people with a disability have the right aposto an adequate standard of living for themselvesapos, which includes housing, and to have a aposcontinuous improvement of living conditions.apos If a person like Tony is deemed to lack mental capacity to make decisions, then under the Mental Capacity Act, an assessment will be made to determine which decision making powers will be delegated to the relevant bodies. This can include anything from finances and housing to day-to-day decisions, and is the responsibility of the relevant authorities to empower and safeguard those under their care. Sadly, as of October this year, , people with a learning disability or autism live in hospitals across England despite decades of efforts by disability activists to de-institutionalise social care.. NHS figures state that at least  of those in hospital care are ready for discharge.Roy believes that evenTony is released, all of those years stuck in hospital will mean that his son will aposnever be the person he wasapos Tony wants nothing more than to leave the hospital, telling Pam: apos[Iaposll] come home soon mum. Iaposm good enough now. I can come home.apos A Brighton  Hove City Council spokesperson said: “We are aware of the dficulties Tony’s parents have faced in seeing their son over the years and are very sympathetic to their situation. “We are working closely with his family and other key parties to secure safe and sustainable accommodation that would enable Tony to live in his own home in the community close to the Brighton area and his parents. “Tony has extremely complex needs. His current out-of-town accommodation is the nearest that offers the specialist care and the very high staffing ratios required to care for him and manage his needs. “We have tried on a number of occasions in recent years to find a sustainable solution for Tony’s care needs nearer to Brighton  Hove that ensures the safety both of Tony and of the staff looking after him. Unfortunately these were not successful. “We are now working with Tony’s parents, NHS colleagues and a new housing provider and we are actively considering options over the coming months which will meet the needs of Tony and the wishes of his parents.” The NHS in the South East said it continues to work closely with Tony his family and the local commissioners involved in his care.It said it is committed to funding Tonyaposs care and has offered £, to fund his care package over the next  years as well as capital funding to support his discharge.

Steve Pexton, , from Leeds, said a short saunter made him feel horrible and left him red-faced.At his heaviest, the semi-retired Network Rail crossing keeper tipped the scales at a staggering  stone and recorded a BMI of over , Leeds Live reported.The NHS states that anything over  is considered severely obese.But Steve swapped his XXXXXL trousers for a snug size M just three years after joining Slimming World and said he feels fitter than he ever did even as a teenager. Steve now weighs just  stone  lbs and said he feels like he’s been handed a new lease of le at the age of .  Steve, who now lives in Knaresborough, Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said: “I’m quite proud of myself for what I’ve done. “I feel  percent fitter than I ever have before, I don’t remember ever being this weight it must have been about  years ago. “There are so many things I can do now that I never could. I can walk, I can get into my car without trouble. “I feel so much more confident to speak to people, and people greet me all of the time which never used to happen. “It feels like I’ve found a completely new and dferent le at .” Steve said he struggled to walk to his own post box just outside his home, but he now enjoys his daily five-mile walks around the stunning North Yorkshire countryside. He added: “Three years ago I never walked anywhere, I used to have trouble getting to my postbox from my house without stopping from oxygen.  “Now I’m walking about five miles a day and I’ve been doing that since the lockdown. “I spent years where I couldn’t even dream of walking anywhere.” One downside of Steve’s incredible weight transformation is that he has been forced to get rid of all of his clothes. He said he can now finally go into any shop and pick anything he wants - which he was never able to do before. “I used to wear XXXXXL but now I fit into mediums. It was very dficult to get clothes, I needed to get them from specialised places.“Now I can walk into any clothes shop and pick whatever I like which is brilliant, he said. Steve said he couldn’t pinpoint the moment he started to see his weight balloon, but said he would often scoff down three takeaways a week.  But after joining Slimming World in October , he managed to lose lbs in his first week and he quickly began to lose more. Steve has now amassed  awards which are given for every half stone lost and he is encouraging others in the same boat to keep at it.Then Breakfast Bowl of muesli A couple of slices of toast with marmalade Coffee Lunch Cheese and onion sandwiches Chocolate bars Large bag of crisps Full fat Coke Dinner Large pizza Garlic bread Chips Full fat Coke BurgerNow Breakfast Weetabix Lunch Pasta pots Skinny Whip bars Diet Coke Dinner Slimming World ready mealsDiet Coke Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Obesity\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Daughter Princess Anne and the Queen’s racing manager John Warren are the two people she will speak to and both of these callers can get through to her majesty from anywhere in the world. Royal commentator Jonathan Sacerdoti made the claim about the Queen’s dialling habits, adding that she uses a Samsung packed with anti-hacker encryption by MI. Mr Sacerdoti told US presenter Christina Garibaldi: “Apparently the Queen has two people who she speaks to the most on her phones and she also apparently has a mobile phone which is said to be Samsung packed with anti-hacker encryption by MI so nobody can hack into her phone. “But the two people she phones the most are said to be her daughter Princess Anne and her racing manager John Warren.” And particularlyJohn calls, “she answers”. “He is the son-in-law of the Queen’s friend, the late Earl of Carnarvon and his home was Highclere castle in Berkshire which viewers of TV may know better as Downton Abbey.”John is one of the world’s leading horsemen and oversees all of the Queen’s racing and breeding interests. Her royal majesty has been involved with horses for over  years and first attended the Royal Ascot in  aged  years old, according to Britain Magazine. And it seems the Queen has an unbreakable bond with her only daughter Anne despite having multiple other children to favour. Their relationship has been captured over the years in photographs, that show the pair coordinate fashion styles and colour schemes. And with a nod to this, the Queen published a series of heartwarming photos to mark Anneaposs st birthday on Sunday  August. Perhaps the pair bonded over horse riding and all things equestrian as it has been a le-time hobby for both. The monarch has been praised for her work-ethic and Anne has followed in her footsteps too by attending royal engagements yearly, reports Hello Magazine.

Owners must rank on a five-point scale statements including: “My cat torments their prey rather than killing it straight away”, “my cat vocalises loudlyfor no apparent reason”, and “my cat is very excitable ”.Other statements include observing whether your cat sits in high places, whether they “dominate” the neighbourhood cats, and whether they purr when attacking people or animals.The results help measure the cat’s levels of “meanness” – traits such as a lack of empathy and callous aggression – “disinhibition” as in issues with behavioural restraint, “boldness” as well as its level of unfriendliness towards people and other pets.  Lead researcher Rebecca Evans of Liverpool University said: “In our study, we developed a questionnaire measure of psychopathy in domestic cats. “The questionnaire was developed using owner-provided examples of their cat’s behaviour in the context of the triarchic model of psychopathy . “The final questionnaire measures five factors of feline psychopathy: boldness, meanness, disinhibition, pet-unfriendliness and human-unfriendliness.”  She continued: “A cat that has a high score on the boldness scale may benefit from large cat trees and tall scratching posts, as the Cat-Tri+ items suggest that a bold cat enjoys exploring and climbing. “Providing environmental enrichment for bold cats may reduce agonistic behaviours towards people, other pets, and possessions.” Researchers hope the test will help improve relationships between cats and their owners, and in turn reduce the number of pets that end up in shelters or being put down.  Ms Evans added: “Behavioural issues such as aggression – conceptually related to meanness – and disobedience, conceptually related to disinhibition, are reported as the reason for around % of cat relinquishments to UK shelters. “Euthanasia of unwanted animals is also the leading cause of death for domestic cats. “That is why it is important that we seek to understand how feline personality affects the quality of the cat-owner relationship.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Liverpool John Moores UniversityUniversity of LiverpoolCatsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She first noticed her legs becoming swollen at the age of Danielle Thornton is fundraising for liposuction Image: Danielle Thornton   CATERS NEWSByHayley PughChiara FiorilloNews Reporter:,  Nov | commentsA woman who said she was branded obese by doctors has been diagnosed with a rare chronic condition that causes her legs to swell up. Danielle Thornton first noticed her legs becoming swollen at the age of  and, despite being a fit and active teenager, she found herself being bullied due to her physical appearance. The -year-old woman said she visited doctors constantly over the past  years and after being labelled as obese, she tried many dferent diets. Danni, a proposal manager from Coventry, said she also walked , steps per day and visited the gym daily in a bid to shrink her legs, but nothing worked.  After visiting a specialist in London in July, she was diagnosed with Lipoedema, an incurable disease caused by an abnormal build-up of fat cells in ious parts of the body. Not only does Danni struggle with her appearance, she now suffers excruciating pain every day and is unable to get out of bed or walk across the room without being in agony as her condition has progressed. Despite her healthy and active lestyle, the circumference of both her thighs and calves increased by cm in just a few months and is continuing to grow.The NHS and Danniaposs own private medical insurance will not cover treatment for Lipoedema - which involves removing the fat from her legs - because it is considered to be cosmetic surgery. Danni, who has a size  waist but has to wear size  trousers in order to get them over her legs, said: I hate the way I look but itaposs not just about that, the pain is unbearable. Itaposs horric at times. I find myself dragging my feet and legs across the floor because they just feel too heavy for me to move. Iaposve been in constant agony since I was a teenager and itaposs only getting worse. I went to an all-girls secondary school and became aware of a dference between me and the other girls almost instantly. I was very athletic and into dance and drama, I started to get an hourglass waist but my legs were huge. I looked like I had been sewn together completely wrong.  Iaposve never been able to wear boots because they wonapost fit around my calves and I live in baggy trousers because nothing  fits. Treatment wonapost cure it but it will make the condition easier to live with and without sounding dramatic that would honestly change my le. Danni has recently set up a GoFundMe page and hopes to raise £, so that she can travel to Poland for specialist treatment - which involves removing  litres of Lipoedema fat from her legs in a single operation. Her condition affects her legs, bottom, stomach and arms, but as her legs cause her the most pain she is desperate for help with those.  She added: Despite the fact that I was exercising and eating a healthy diet, I couldnapost figure out why my legs were getting bigger. I had constant doctor visits where I was told that I simply needed to go on a diet, that I was obese, that I should try water tablets, and that I should move more but I had a feeling there was something wrong with my health.I would not have recognised the symptomsit hadnapost been for the other ladies speaking out about Lipoedema on Facebook and Instagram.Iaposm not normally the type to ask for help and I am continuing to save as much money as I can but the costs involved are extortionate. I just want to reduce the pain so that I can enjoy my le and help make others aware of the condition.To make a donation, you can click here.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Obesity\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But we do know that getting in a flimsy boat on a freezing, wild sea felt like a better option than whatever they were leaving behindGulwali, now  and living in Kettering Image: Ken McKay ITV REX ShutterstockByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnist:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsLast night, when Gulwali ­Passerlay went to take out the bins he found himself breaking down. “It was so cold out there. I thought how cold it must have been in that sea. A pregnant woman, children, men in that cold water. When I went to bed, I couldn’t sleep for thinking about them in the water.” Watching the tragedy in the Channel unfold, in which  men, seven women and three children died, and two people were taken to hospital with ­hypothermia, I thought of a passage in Gulwali’s book. The Lightless Sky tells the story of his ,-mile journey from Afghanistan to safety in the UK in lorries and on a dangerously ­overcrowded boat. “I have heard somewhere that drowning is a peaceful death,” he writes. “Whoever said that hasn’t watched men soil themselves with fear aboard an overcrowded, broken-down boat in the middle of a raging ­Mediterranean storm.” Gulwali’s journey across the sea took  hours, with  other people on a boat built for . He was just  years old. “I was very, very scared,” says Gulwali, now  and living in Kettering, Northants. “I knew I was face to face with death. You see your death. You know you are going to die. Those people in the Channel, they would have known their death and, for them, help was not there. “I made it out alive only because the Greek coastguard rescued us. We were lucky –they hadn’t, our boat would have capsized. It was holed on every side.”  His own eventual journey across the Channel was in the back of a ­refrigerated lorry, carrying bananas and a terried child. It was his th attempt to cross from France to Britain. Had the lorry driver switched the refrigerator on, Gulwali would have died like the people in the cold sea on Wednesday, on the last leg of his journey. “People ask ‘why do they come to the UK’  And I ask, ‘why not’ ” Gulwali says. “England says ­refugees should stay in France. France says Italy. Italy says Greece who built a wall with Turkey who built a wall with Iran, which they say is a safe country. Who is going to take the responsibility for this crisis  Who is going to give people some hope  “Instead, we saythese people die, it’s not our problem. If they drown, it’s tough. Turn the boats away.” Gulwali’s journey began in eastern Afghanistan during the years of the war on terror. His father, a doctor, and beloved grandfather were killed in a firefight with American troops.  With an uncle in the Taliban, Gulwali and his brother Hazrat were called on to martyr themselves to avenge their father’s death. The boys’ mother paid , to get them “to safety” in Europe. When the other option was watching your sons blow themselves up at an American army base, was she wrong  Today, after a dficult start in the UK, her son has a Master’s degree from Coventry University, a family, is a published author and runs his own company. We don’t yet know the stories of the  men, women and children who lost their lives. But we do know that getting in a flimsy boat on a freezing, wild sea felt like a better option than whatever they were leaving behind. We know that the two rescued people – who are in critical care – are from Iraq and Somalia. French media are reporting that the dead are believed to be Iraqi or Iranian Kurds. France’s Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin described their boat as “extremely fragile… like a pool you blow up in your garden”. We know that yesterday, despite almost certainly knowing the fate of the , more people set off on the same deadly journey. “If I went to Calais now, would I tell people not to cross ” Gulwali says. “I would tell themFrance will give you accommodation and a work visa you should stay. Butnot  If the other option is to be sent home or stay in the hell of Calais… I can’t tell them not to cross.” To understand why more and more people are making the crossing, we need to understand that government policy since  has gradually shut down almost every single safe and legal route through which people could have had their asylum application considered before making that crossing. The truth is that Britain doesn’t take anything like a fair share of refugees – we are one of the countries taking the fewest. Less than % of the refugees in the world. But Boris Johnson ’s government was elected on the back of Brexit, and a promise to take back control of Britain’s borders. The less rosy post-Brexit Britain looks, the more hysterical tough talk about our borders we should expect.So, the Government’s response to a human tragedy will be to ratchet up even further the anti-refugee sentiment. It will be the excuse it needs to push through the most anti-refugee legislation – Priti Patel’s odious Borders Bill is currently going through Parliament – this country has ever seen. It should be called the People Smugglers’ Bill. The price goes up every time a legal route disappears. Somewhere deep down we know the answer is the exact opposite. To create safe and legal routes, and to find compassionate solutions. To give people hope we will deal with them fairly. To take our fair share of refugees and use our international standing to support peace and tackle climate emergency. Why did Gulwali come to the UK  For the most human of reasons. He had heard his brother had reached here. And because he had made a promise to his mum. “When my brother and I fled Afghanistan, my mum said: ‘No matter how bad it gets, don’t come back, and hold on to each other’s hands’,” he says. “So, when the smugglers separated us, the thing that kept me going on the journey was not letting my mum down.” Now it is Gulwali’s turn to worry about his mother who is trapped in Afghanistan as the country starves. An unfolding crisis that will only lead to more desperate people setting off from the shores of northern France, as we drag our heels on taking refugees. The deaths on Wednesday were an avoidable tragedy. And they are just the ones we know about. Unless Britain changes course, the Channel risks becoming an ever-growing mass grave.

People were still advised to only travelabsolutely necessary as the storm continued to pose a danger to le, and the Met Office described gusts overnight as “damaging” and having affected “a wide swathe of the United Kingdom”. As much as cm of snow was expected over the Pennines and cm on higher ground in the Midlands, with flakes settling at lower levels across the UK.

Friday night’s rugby union Premiership game between Newcastle Falcons and Worcester Warriors was postponed until Saturday evening due to safety concerns.And in North Wales, ITV was forced to pre-record Friday night’s live episode of I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out Of Here! amid concerns, including that poor weather would interfere with the broadcast around Gwrych Castle.Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said it had been dealing with a “large” number of incidents late on Friday “caused by the current weather conditions including many fallen trees and roofs being blown off structures”. Meanwhile ScotRail services were disrupted between Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street, Dunblane and Stirling after a barn was blown onto the line close to Polmont, near Falkirk.  The Met Office described the conditions as “horrendous” and people also reported power cuts. Footage showed howling winds whipping up the North Sea in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, and snowfall where, including in Redcar, Yorkshire, and Whitley Bay, Northumberland. A Met Office statement said: “People should stay away from the coast as waves and debris are a danger to le.” After the warnings expire, more wintry showers are expected in the north and east, and it will be a very cold night with widespread frost and icy patches.

Ashley Stephen Payne, , has been jailed for  weeks for several offences, including the attack on the -year-old woman. CCTV released after he was sentenced showed him aggressively running towards the teenage magazine seller before hitting her on the head. The girl is knocked to the ground from the force of the blow, prompting bystanders to rush to her aid.Payne, of Bristol, was sentenced at Bristol Magistrates’ Court on Monday  November.He was also charged with  additional offences that he admitted to, including assault on the -year-old woman, a separate assault on a -year-old shop worker, and  counts of theft. Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. All the offences were committed between  August and  November this year in the Fishponds and Staple Hill areas of Bristol. After the case, Sgt Andrew Bradshaw, said: We’re pleased with the custodial sentence given to Payne by the court for the series of offences he committed in our local community over a two-month spell. “The attack on the -year-old woman was a particularly cowardly and unnecessary act of aggression – all because she challenged him for stealing from a local store. “It’s taken persistence and hard work by the neighbourhood team and our colleagues in the Detainee Investigation Team to investigate this series of offences and gather the evidence needed to secure these convictions.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON CCTVCCTV footage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The World Health Organisation warned evidence suggests the iant, labelled Omicron in its Greek alphabet naming convention, has an increased risk of re-infection and may sp rapidly. The iant should have been called Nu but the WHO believes that would be confused with the word “new”, so used the next letter – omicron. From midday today, the UK halted flights from six countries: South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Swaziland. Health Secretary Sajid Javid, in an urgent statement in the Commons, told the public: “If you’ve arrived from any of these countries in the last  days, NHS Test and Trace will be asking you to take a PCR test.“But please don’t wait to be contacted. You should take PCR tests right away.” He added: “It is highly likely it has spread to other ­countries. We are concerned this iant may pose substantial risk to public health.” Almost , people have arrived from South Africa in the past two weeks. Around  cases of Omicron had been found by genetic sequencing in South Africa, Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel. The European ­Commission has ­recommended an EU-wide travel ban to and from southern Africa.  Experts fear history could repeat itself a year after the Alpha iant triggered a Christmas lockdown. Prof Adam Finn, of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, warned: “We all need to be ready for the possibility of a change in the restrictions.” Mr Javid said the Government is still following its Plan A but warned, “ we need to go further, we will”. Prof Sharon Peacock, director of the Covid- Genomics UK ­Consortium, said we may only be able to “buy time” before the Omicron iant gets in to Britain.  She said: “Once a new iant of concern emerges, and it’s fitter than the previous iant, it can be ­dficult to stop it going into a country unless you have very, very ­stringent lockdown rules.” Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “It is the most worrying we have seen.” Askedit could already be in Britain, she said: “It’s always possible.” Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies, said: “This is a huge worry. The molecular data would point to perhaps this thing being able to evade the immune response.” And England’s Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty told the Local Government Association his greatest fear is people would not adhere to another lockdown after “two years of their lives being interfered with”.  Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said any spread “could coincide with what we’re expecting to be an extremely ­dficult winter”. Carol Popplestone, council chair of the Royal College of Nursing, called for swt action. She urged: “The Government must reintroduce compulsory face coverings immediately and set out further steps in the coming days.” Welsh rugby teams Cardf and Scarlets were trying tofrom South Africa, and  UK and Ireland golfers have quit the Johannesburg Open. Tourists from the UK landing in Cape Town wept when they were told South Africa was “red listed”. Anna DeMarigny, , of Galway, Ireland, had flown in to see her terminally ill friend.  She said: “My daughter is due to visit me from San Francisco with her baby. I can’t go into quarantine. I’m going to have to cut short my stay.” Tony Haupt, , of Oxford, had arrived to visit five of his six ­children. He said: “I hope I get back in time for my daughter’s graduation.” Mr Javid said the ban on flights is temporary while the UK re-established its Red List hotel ­quarantine scheme. But Dr Angelique Coet­­zee, of the South African Medical ­Association, said the travel restrictions are “like a storm in a teacup.” Downing Street said Boris Johnson had spoken to South Africa’s ­president Cyril Ramaphosa, saying: “The PM commended South Africa’s leadership in transparently sharing data.”AstraZeneca said it is hopeful that its antibody cocktail will retain ­efficacy against the omicron iant. England’s weekly R number has risen above one to between . and ., estimates suggest. In the latest -hour period, , infections were recorded, the highest daily count for over a month.

Sometimes the waist is too loose and the bum is too tight, others youaposve got the perfectbut you need to size up.And, sometimes, as what happened with one lady, youaposre left with legs so long you may as well try and use them as flippers, because youaposd have more luck swimming with them than walking down the street.Thataposs exactly what happened to TikTok user Melanie Wilmoth @melaniewilmoth , when she ordered a pair of scrunched up, flared blue jeans from retailer giant Shein.  Melanie, who works as a personal trainer, decided to treat herself to the s-style trousers, which appear to be designed to be worn in a bunched up fashion.But, when the trousers arrived, it turned out they werenapost bunched together by stitches like you might expect instead they were just really, really long.Melanie took to TikTok to share a screenshot taken from the Shein website, before sharing a clip of herself wearing the jeans, and itaposs fair to say the dference is stark. Alongside the clip, she wrote: Shein, count your days! But, not everyone was impressed, with many commenting to point out the jeans are supposed to be pulled up. Girl, pull the pants up and itaposll literally be the picture, one commented, while another added: So we all agree itaposs her and not the pants. In follow up clip, Melanie took her followersapos advice and decided to pull up the jeans, before coming to the conclusion that they werenapost the right style for her.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Those who want to be considered as future tenants will also need to apply for a free Ikea Family membership to qualy.  The company said the tiny living space will be then rented out with a lease until January , . The tenant will be responsible for paying their own bills, Ikea said. Any person interested in renting the flat, though, will have to consider how small the space around them is - with the main living area being just  square feet.  In comparison, the UK governmentaposs minimum space requirement for a single-person dwelling is  square feet. Ikea said they tried to do their best to make the space livable. The company said on its website: One of the keys is to make good use of the vertical space. By capturing the room three-dimensionally, new possibilities open up in a limited space.  Ikea used its famous toy shark, Blahaj, to promote the project online and around Japan. Tokyo is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and a trend for micro-apartments has recently emerged.The Tokyo politan Government estimates that the city is home to just over  million people. According to Japan Guide, the average monthly rent for a one-room apartment is between ,and ,yen. Over the summer, a tiny house measuring just . metres in width went on the market in London for £, in London.The two-bedroom terraced pad is on Third Cross Road in Twickenham and has an extended kitchen diner. The open area has skylights and double doors to the garden - which bring in plenty of natural light. And the living room could easily be mistaken for a corridor, but there is just enough room to fit some armchairs and a sofa.

The shocked man from the province of Saraburi in Thailand called the local snake wrangler and waited outside his home until the specialists arrived.He guided the team to the toilet where the deadly snake curled behind the plastic water tank. As the team approached the ft-long creature, it slithered through a tiny gap, attempting to escape and even spitting its venom at the specialist. The team managed to catch the reptile within  minutes, using a snake hook to place it into a sack and carrying it out of the house.  The terrying serpent was later freed to the wild. Surapon said: I was terried to discover a cobra spreading its hood at me. Iaposm glad I was the first to find the snake as it could have hurt my son.Last year, a pensioner was left shaken after finding a king cobra lurking behind his washing machine. Sakorn Sayan, , first became aware of the snake while taking a bath as he heard a noise reminiscent of a water leak from behind the machine at his home in Trang, southern Thailand. Glancing at the device located in his bathroom, he immediately saw the snakeaposs tail poking out from beneath the machine. Terried Mr Sayan said he leapt out of the bath, grabbed a towel and ran out of the house to call for help. Cobras are large, venomous snakes that hiss and spit - and have the ability to raise the upper part of their bodies. Their bites can be fatal, especiallyleft untreated.  Thailand is home to three species of cobras and the King Cobra which is considered to be a separate genus.Last year, a British dad almost died when he was bitten by a King Cobra in India.Ian Jones, , from the Isle of Wight, passed in and out of a coma and was given anti-venom, oxygen and CPR in order to survive. Doctors told him he was incredibly lucky to survive the double bite from the venomous reptile - which has enough venom in one bite to kill  men. The dad-of-two suffered paralysis and blindness following the incident in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, although his family hoped his condition would improve over time. Tragically, earlier this year his brother Mark revealed his condition deteriorated and he is now unlikely to regain the use of his legs.

Passenger Juliana Amorim said: Flight attendants started saying the plane was going to blow up, that we needed to evacuate the plane, and that it was urgent. I donapost know how many people got out in front of me, but I managed to leave, thank God, without any injury. I went down the slide and saw a lot of injured people. When I went down the slide, the engine was on and it was so windy that people were being knocked over.  The airline said in a statement: Customers evacuated the aircraft via the planeaposs emergency exits. Azul would like to emphasise that we are providing all the necessary support to customers, and regret what happened.

vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there is ldquohuge international concern surrounding the strain after banning flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia to limit its spread.Mr Javid told MPs there are concerns the iant may be more transmissible, make existing vaccines less effective and may hinder one of the UKrsquos Covid treatments, Ronapreve.Ministers were facing calls to go further to prevent a wave of the new iant arriving in Britain while a Delta surge is ongoing, as Belgium became the first EU country to announce a case.Professor John Edmunds, who advises the Government as part of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , warned that could create a ldquovery, very, very dficult

category for concerning iants.Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an ldquoincreased risk of reinfection and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a ldquogrowth advantage.Novavax said it has ldquoalready initiated development of a new recombinant spike protein based on the known genetic sequence of B... and will have it ready to begin testing and

iant which could escape the effects of the vaccines, the firm expects ldquoto be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that iant in approximately  days, subject to regulatory approval.No cases of the new strain have been detected in the UK but its arrival in Belgium ndash after being found in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel ndash has heightened concerns.Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the Rega Institute in Belgium, said a sample was confirmed as the iant in a traveller who ed from Egypt on November  before first showing symptoms  days later.The six African countries

Letrsquos look at the dferent stages in the le of both types of trees.Real treesThe growing time for real trees is approximately - years to reach the most popular size of  ft . During that time, they provide habitat for wildle, capture carbon from the atmosphere, stabilise ground that is often unsuitable for other uses and reduce water run-off that can cause erosion.With estimated sales of in excess of seven million real trees sold in the UK every year, itrsquos clear that forestry also provides much-needed rural employment.You donrsquot need to worry about deforestation either: Christmas trees are a renewable resource, generally grown as a crop with up to  trees being planted for every two-metre tree that is cut down, ensuring that the environmental benefits of woodland are maintained and potentially even improved.As the seedling grows into a tree, itrsquos clear that real trees make positive benefits to our environment but once that tree leaves the forest or the nursery, your choices begin to matter.How can you help the environment  The first step is easy: buy a Scottish-grown tree from a local business and you minimise the carbon miles from the forest to your home.Most reputable garden centres in the area should be able to offer you a Scottish-grown tree, but other outlets may not. We recommend that you check the source before you buy!But itrsquos what happens to the tree after Christmas where you can make a real dference. Research shows that the way in which the tree is disposed of has considerably dferent environment effects.At one end of the spectrum, landfill is the worst possible solution for disposing of your Christmas tree, since decomposition and the release of methane negatively impact on the environment. Surprisingly, even burning the tree is preferable to landfill as that reduces potential emissions by over  per cent.At the other end of the spectrum, one of the most environmentally friendly solutions is to reuse the tree by chipping it for mulch or to compost it.Chipping simply accelerates the plant cycle that would occur naturally on the forest floor.This non-chemical process helps the tree break down more quickly than it otherwise would in the forest, naturally ing fibre and nutrients to the soil.Local authorities often offer a collect and chip service, and East Lothian Council have done so for a number of years now.Articial treesArticial trees, it is argued, are environmentally friendly because they can be re-used year after year and, for many, itrsquos the ideal solution for reasons of practicality and convenience. In fact, the key to determining whether an articial or a real tree is more environmentally friendly lies in the number of times you use the articial tree. Letrsquos consider the factors.Most articial trees are manufactured in China using plastic, PVC and metal, and these are then shipped to consumers around the world.The materials used in production and the global shipping distances involved in delivery combine to result in a considerable negative environmental impact from articial trees.And whilst the tree can be reused year after year, there still remains the problem of disposal at the end of its le articial trees are not recyclable and inevitably end up in landfill.According to the Carbon Trust, the carbon footprints for a m tree are:l Articial tree ndash kgl Real tree to landfill ndash kgl Real tree, chipped ndash .kg.Therefore, their advice is that you need to re-use your articial tree more than  times to equal the carbon footprint of a real tree that is responsibly disposed of. Many articial trees are not built to last that long and soyou decide that an articial tree is best for your lestyle, try to buy one that genuinely can be reused over at least  years.In conclusionCaring for our environment is a complex matter, andit only involved a single issue ndash such as the carbon footprint figures above ndash decisions would be easy. But itrsquos rarely that simple you only need to think about the many iables mentioned in this article to understand the complexity of the decisions we all have to make.We hope that this article offers you a brief overview that will help you decide which type of tree is best for you.As always, our plant team are happy to discuss the options with you and help you decide what tree ndash real or articial ndash is best for you.Theyrsquore also able to explain how you can get the very best from your tree and enjoy it throughout the Christmas

The Covid impact of the past two years has left theatres darker than Phantomrsquos catacombs. And any normal -year-old billionaire who owns eight West End theatres surely would have decided enough is enough and stayed at home to watch Hairspray on Netflix.However, thatrsquos far from the case. Indeed, Mack is back in town with a vengeance. ldquoItrsquos the most concentrated period of my le, he says. ldquoLes Mis is my seventh show Irsquove opened since July, right across the world. In fact, Irsquom supposed to be getting on a plane at the weekend, to open Miss Saigon in Vienna.\"But as we all know, Vienna has shut down for a month, so we wonrsquot know for  days whether we will get to open.He offers a hint of a sigh. ldquoIt would all be a huge amount of work to do in normal circumstances. But with Covid, itrsquos been a nightmare. I hope I never have to go through all that again.The producer offers up a hint of the current complexities in trying to make theatre happen. ldquoThe key creative staff there [in Vienna] is a core of people. And you only have them contracted for a short period because they are due to go on to another show. So, yoursquore worried about that. Then yoursquore worried about the actors getting Covid, and yoursquore worried about the audience. But having said that, the audiences have been incredibly supportive. Theyrsquore coming in.Mackintoshrsquos Les Mis is selling so well he doesnrsquot really have to promote the show. But you sense he wants to herald its . And why shouldnrsquot he  The producer lives to make theatre. He lives to watch rehearsals, check out the fine detail, check the lighting and sound making sure his French revolution tale is an exercise in theatrical perfection. ldquoWe have a wonderful cast for this six-week run, he enthuses. ldquoI wish we were here for  weeks because Irsquom sure we could sell it out.He adds: ldquoOne of the few pluses to come out of Covid is that the public seem more aware of what goes into creating a theatre show. What seems effortless takes a huge amount of effort. I think they appreciate what we do.But what of the weight on his shoulders  Itrsquos hard enough being a theatre producer with shows running around the world without having to contend with continuing disasters.ldquoWhat Irsquove had to do is keep the business going. And itrsquos been very, very hard. Irsquom unique in that Irsquom not owned by a hedge fund. I donrsquot have outside investors. By and large, I am my own boss and I have to employ people to run my theatres and shows. The truth is all my theatres and shows around the world were doing incredibly well, then suddenly we found that a lot of trains were suddenly hurtling into brick walls, globally.His voice becomes darker. ldquoCommercial theatre in this country has had virtually no support from the government, apart from rates relief, or furlough. But most people who work for us are freelance, so theyrsquove fallen out of that net. Itrsquos all very dferent to the likes of America and Australia and Japan who recognised that theatre is the heart and the soul of the country, but also the economic drivers.How did he feel when Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said recently that commercial theatres didnrsquot need cash injections from the Commercial Relief Fund, and the fact they are still standing is proof of that fact  ldquoDid she say that  Well, nothing this government says would surprise me although we are hoping the Chancellor will at least help us with a tax break to get us through this winter, to get these big shows back up.He takes a moment to reflect. ldquoIrsquom proud of people who work for me. So many actors have had to take on other jobs. My actor who plays Valjean in Les Mis has been out driving a truck and going around Tescos. Itrsquos been humbling. Wersquove also lost around a third of the people who would normally work in theatre. Some have decided that the job they took to keep their livelihoods going suits them better now.Mackintosh reveals that as well as losing many creatives and backstage people, hersquos lost a signicant number of actors. ldquoThere are so many TV series being made everywhere, with the likes of Netflix, and wersquore losing so many of our character actors. Amazon have four or five big studios operating in Britain right now. And the knock-on effect is that theatre is being drained of talent.Yet, true to form, the producer is turning the problem on its head. ldquoWhatrsquos exciting about this [Les Mis] company is that there are three people who havenrsquot been at drama school, playing younger characters. Because Irsquom involved with the Conservatoire in Glasgow, a lot of the students are doing workshops with my company during the run of the show.For any young person considering a le in theatre, Cameron Mackintosh is an exercise in the power of passion and determination, to be part of great theatre. Ever since an aunt took him along to a production of the musical Salad Days in , the seven-year-old was entranced by the stage and hasnrsquot stopped wanting to create theatre ever since.At school, the young Cameron,was nicknamed Darryl F Mackintosh, in a nod to the legendary Hollywood mogul. Aged , Mackintosh landed work on Oliver! as an assistant stage manager, while also playing the role of a Pot Boy. Years later, he still has the poster from the show ndash lsquoTo Cameron, the man who gets things done,rsquo scribbled by an actor in the production.Yet, early attempts at producing shows were disastrous. One of his first, Anything Goes, in , lost pound, in unsecured loans and another, Home with the Dales, lost pound, ldquobecause no one wanted to see it. He produced yet another turkey in After Shave, which hersquod hoped would be a female Beyond the Fringe.Try, try again  Thankfully, he did. Mackintosh was still living in a pound-a-week rented flat in  when, at the age of , he met with chum Andrew Lloyd Webber for lunch to discuss an idea. The composer reckoned a musical could be written based on TS Eliot poems. ldquoWe went back to his flat and he played me some of his settings of Old Possumrsquos Book of Practical Cats and I went, lsquoOh, therersquos something there.rsquoThe producerrsquos resilience had won out. But you also need the instinct to spot a great idea, know the component parts of theatre intrinsically, or be prepared to wrestle for years for the rights to stage Mary Poppins.And it helps to have the thrust to grab onto Hamilton, which he hopes will come to Scotland in two three years. Mackintosh, who has a home at Loch Nevis, laughs as he points out ldquoOf course, Alexander Hamilton came from Nevis, before being sent to America. So, Hamilton is really a Scottish musical.Itrsquos fitting Cameron Mackintosh has ed to Glasgow with Les Mis, the ultimate show of defiance. Mackintosh speaks at someabout how young people represent great hope for the theatre future ndash his new venture Mountview, a fantastic new facility in London offers, he says, people of every race and background the chance to come through and get first class training.ldquoWhen Andrew and I started to do Cats, we had to audition for months to find people of the standard we needed. Now,  years on, London can run  musicals at once.ldquoFinding black performers was dficult when I first did Five Guys Named Moe. Now, there are many wonderful black and Asian performers out there.He adds: ldquoYou need the work to attract the people. And the more successful a show is the more you have to bring in new talent to feed it.A show such as Les Mis  ldquoYes. Itrsquos a great musical but it has such a social resonance, and it never dates. It reminds there are always people out there fighting for a better tomorrow.His smile alone suggests a forward momentum that is almost uncontainable. ldquoAnd thankfully this show proves that tomorrow always comes.Cameron Mackintoshrsquos, Les Miseacuterables, Theatre Royal, Glasgow,  November -  December"},{"url":null,"title":"new-glasgow-bridge-costs-risen-due-brexit","story":"Work will get underway in January to build a new crossing linking Partick and Govan, re-establishing a history connection between the two areas.The cost of the bridge was originally tabled as pound.million but has risen to pound.million.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said all construction projects were facing substantial cost increases as a result of Brexit and the pandemic, which has led to steel prices doubling in the past six months.He said the scope of the project had also increased and will require \"very complex engineering\".: poundmillion wellbeing retreat planned for Glasgow City CentreA signicant proportion of the cost is said to be associated with the mechanical and electrical elements required to allow the swing bridge to open.The council said the price had been tested through an open-market tender and benchmarked against the MediaCity Footbridge in Salford, said to similar in structure.FarransLtd will lead the project to create the pedestrian and cycle bridge over the River Clyde between Water Row in Govan and Pointhouse Quay in Partick.The council said  contractors submitted bids, with the top five scoring of these invited to submit a tender.Three did, with Farrans achieving the highest score on criteria which included price, quality, design, construction impact, quality control and fair work practices.: Core of Glasgow city centre to become car free within five yearsWorks are expected to begin on-site in January , with project completion towards the end of .The new bridge is a Glasgow City Region City Deal project, with funding awarded by the Scottish and UK Government.Project leaders say  construction jobs will be created including five new apprentices and a new graduate school mentoring work placement.A council spokeswman said:\"The reasons for the increase in cost include the well-documented price increases facing all construction projects at this time as a result of Brexit and the pandemic and an increased scope for the project. \"This is aswing opening bridge that will feature very complex engineering.\"The requirement to provide navigational clearance over a  metres navigational channel means that the main span of the bridge is approximately  metres long, making it one of the longest opening footbridges in the UK. \"A signicant proportion of the cost is associated with the mechanical and electrical elements required to allow the bridge to open.\"The contract also includes the cost of the extension of the quay wall at Pointhouse Quay which is needed to provide a landing point for the bridge on the north bank.\"Final approval of the contract will be considered at the Glasgow City Region Cabinet on  December."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13085594.jpg?type=article-full","title":"first-hampden-park-campaigners-bid-world-heritage-site-status","story":"Just a year later, the original Hampden Park opened on October , , and became home to Queenrsquos Park FC and the Scotland national team until .It closed due to the building of the Cathcart Circle railway line.Last month archaeological experts finally proved that what is now known as Hampden Bowling Club is the site of the first national stadium.Read more:Extra time secured for club on site of historic first Hampden ParkArchaeological digs proved that records found by Hampden devotee Graeme Brown, which suggested the bowling club site was the first Hampden Park, and now a campaign is due to be launched this week with the hope of securing UNESCO World Heritage status for the place where it is considered football began.Campaigners believe the site should have world heritage statusTomorrow a virtual meeting of experts and enthusiast will join together to discuss the history and legacy of the first Hampden and explore the stance that Scots led the way for the modern game which is played and watched by millions around the world.The evidence to back up records discovered by Mr Brown, of the Hampden Collection initiative, came just weeks after the site was given a reprieve when it was feared Hampden Bowling Club itself might have been in jeopardy. Members managed to elect a new committee and secure time to be able to carry out a structural report for repairs to the clubhouse. Had they been unable to elect a committee the lease would have been lost with the site reverting back to arms- council organisation City Property.Former Scotland and Queens Park player Joseph TaylorIn  Mr Brown, who was then with Hampden Bowling Club, discovered a railway map proving Hampden Bowling Clubrsquos legendary tale and this year digs were carried out in a bid for hard evidence. And with  months to go before the th anniversary of the first international, Mr Brown believes now is the time for Scotlandrsquos contribution to football to be recognised and the site of the first Hampden being protected.Read more:Scotlands first national football ground faces uncertain futureMr Brown leads what has become known as The Hampden Collection and Footballrsquos Square Mile - the Worldrsquos Biggest lsquoOpen Airrsquo football museum in Glasgow which follows the discovery of the foundation stone of the Worldrsquos first enclosed purposefully built international football ground.Mr Brown, who will bring together a  of guests for the event, said: ldquoThe next stage of the footballing journey is to get the entire st Hampden Site recognised as the epicentre of World Football. However, to do that, and to bring the story to le, we have brought in a number of other sites that have huge signicance in the story of football, and as launched earlier this year, created the worldrsquos biggest open air football museum.ldquoIn our opinion, this is the way to stamp Scotlandrsquos claim, and also brings huge amount of opportunity to tell this story. Footballrsquos Square Mile is the way to do it and the campaign to make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site will be launched this week which will be one year to go until the th anniversary of the worlds first international football match.Joseph Taylors great grandson Colin discovered the grave in Cathcart CemeteryMr Brown realises it will be a dficult process, but says they are ready for the campaign.ldquoWith the timing and signicant dates next year, along with the possibility that Scotland could be playing at the World Cup, we want to put the spotlight on just how important the discovery of the first Hampden and Footballrsquos Square Mile is. If this was anywhere  in the world that could lay claim to the beginning of football as we know it, it would be a world tourist attraction so why not here.Carrying out a geophysical survey, as well as excavating six trenches in the Queens Park Recreation Ground and Kingsley Gardens site, the archaeologists revealed evidence of the foundations of the first Hampden Park pavilion where the first players to play for Queens Park and Scotland would have got changed before matches and where the team officials would have sat.One of the sites on the Hampden walking tourThey also found tantalising evidence of the original playing surface, sealed beneath over a century of earth and grass, as well as numerous artefacts dropped by the early supporters including beer bottles, juice bottles and clay pipes.Dr Paul Murtagh, Senior Project Officer at Archaeology Scotland who managed the st Hampden Dig Team, said the project was unique in more ways than one as it brought people together.Dr Murtagh said: ldquoThis was a project which was part of Archaeology Scotlandrsquos New Audience Project, funded by Historic Environment Scotland, and brought people from dferent backgrounds and nationalities together. Football was the hook for this and while it not be their own countryrsquos heritage they were helping to establish part footballing heritage.ldquoWe were very lucky to have records to got on but it was when we dug the trenches and with the use of geophysics we could really pinpoint the site. The findings, which included artefacts from people who would have stood on the terraces, really give you something tangible from that moment in time.A group enjoying the Hampden tourGlasgow Football Tour founder Lindsay Hamilton had been aware of the myth surrounding the site of the first Hampden Park, but like many people didnrsquot think much more of it.It was only when Mr Brown approached her to consider working on a Hampden walking tour that she found out more.ldquoIrsquove been offering tours around Glasgowrsquos five main stadiums for many years and I love telling people about our footballing heritage, said Ms Hamilton. ldquoBefore covid I had been taking tourists from all over the world to Hampden Park, Ibrox Stadium, Celtic Park, Cathkin Park and Firhill as well as part of a -minute minibus tour.ldquoGraeme was on my first tour and I remember him saying to me do you want to help me save Hampden Bowling Club and I wondered what he was talking about, but it was the rumour that it was the site of the first Hampden which Graeme then went on to find the map from the National Records of Scotland which showed where it would have been.Due to covid restrictions Ms Hamiltonrsquos minibus tours of the football grounds couldnrsquot go ahead, so a walking tour of the Hampden sites was developed.ldquoThe idea came about for the walking tour bringing in the three Hampden sites and was a chance to be able to tell the story of and signicance of the beginning of world football and the game we know today, Ms Hamilton added.ldquoPeople were keen to get outdoors and embraced walking more during lockdown and we ran nine walking tours this year. When you tell people about the history behind the first Hampden Park they are in disbelief. I think people on the tour, who were all Scottish as we still didnrsquot have international visitors at the time, felt very proud and we want people to go on tell the story and pass it on. The first Hampden needs to be protected and should be celebrated as the site where the modern game watched by billions around the world began.One football fan who joined the tour had a particular interest in Scotlandrsquos football heritage as he is very much part of it.Colin Taylor, the great grandson of Joseph Taylor, was drawn to the tour on his first trip to Glasgow to investigate his football history.ldquoI was always told as a youngster that Joseph Taylor played football for Queens Park, Colin said. ldquoLater I was told he also played for Scotland, but kind of took that with a pinch of salt. When my father passed away in  I started to get interested in family history and with my fatherrsquos brother, my paternal uncle, who was by then in his mid s, started looking through old photos and we found one of Joseph and one of his grave. My uncle said he had looked for Josephrsquos grave in the rsquos but assumed it was in Langside and thought it had been lost during bombing in the Second World War.Ten yearsrsquo ago Colin discovered the location of Taylorrsquos grave by accident.Colin added: ldquoIt was a simple email to Cathcart, I emailed every cemetery in Glasgow, and I discovered where he rested. I was also contacted by the historian Andy Mitchell who sent me more information on Joseph and a photo of his grave.ldquoI saw an opportunity this year after lockdown to go to Scotland for a few days and visit Josephrsquos grave and visit Hampden. I was intrigued by the three Hampdenrsquos story and the discovery of the very first Hampden.ldquoI joined a walking tour in September and I achieved my ambition of seeing Josephrsquos grave, seeing the original Hampden where he played, and Queenrsquos Park where he also played and practised.I could feel goosebumps looking at the old pavilion at the bowling club and imagining Joseph not only playing there but also being instrumental in some major decisions as he was president of Queens Park for a year after he finished playing in ."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive accessas we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive pound for two months offer here.From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expectground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content ndash as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just pound for two monthshere.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as ldquounsatisfactory on pollution, according to data from the ScottishEnvironmentProtection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oilcompanies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as ldquovery poor in .

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

concerning strain of coronavirus that has sparked travel bans.The iant, named Omicron and designated a ldquoiant of concern by the World Health Organisation , has reached Belgium after being discovered in South Africa.The WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the iant has an increased risk of reinfection and may sp rapidly than other strains.A number of pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there is ldquohuge international concern surrounding the strain after banning flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia to limit its spread.Mr Javid told MPs there are concerns the iant may be more transmissible, make existing vaccines less effective and may hinder one of the UKrsquos Covid treatments, Ronapreve.Ministers were facing calls to go further to prevent a wave of the new iant arriving in Britain while a Delta surge is ongoing, as Belgium became the first EU country to announce a case.Professor John Edmunds, who advises the Government as part of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , warned that could create a ldquovery, very, very dficult situation.The EU, US and Canada all followed Britainrsquos move to impose travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa ahead of the WHO adding the strain, also known as B..., to its highest category for concerning iants.Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an ldquoincreased risk of reinfection and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a ldquogrowth advantage.Novavax said it has ldquoalready initiated development of a new recombinant spike protein based on the known genetic sequence of B... and will have it ready to begin testing and manufacturing within the next few weeks.Moderna said: ldquoSince early , Moderna has advanced a comprehensive strategy to anticipate new iants of concern.ldquoThis strategy includes three levels of response should the currently authorized  microgbooster dose of mRNA- prove insufficient to boost waning immunity against the Omicron iant.Pfizer and BioNTech said that in the

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

But as he can find change a worry, it’s time for Casper to move for the final time into a permanent new home. Stephanie Scott, Home from Home Co-ordinator at Ballymena said: “Casper is a very sweet natured boy with a lovely character who loves playing with his toys especially a ball. “He also has a sensitive side where he can be shy and anxious about open spaces and leaving what he considers to be his safe places. “We noticed this when he first came into kennels when he didn’t want to leave his kennel, so we felt that he would cope better in a foster home and he is enjoying le with his foster family who are patient and kind. “However, placing a dog in a foster home is only ever a temporary measure so it is now time for Casper to find his new family.“Casper is happy and content when he spends time with his foster family in the house or garden but upon leaving this space for walks he can become nervous. “We think many people will be able to relate to Casper’s worries following the pandemic when going out into the world again can lead to anxiety.“Casper very much enjoys company and is an affectionate dog once he knows you. “He likes someone being around most of the time and in his foster home he likes to sleep in the bedroom area. We know that whoever rehomes Casper will be getting a devoted canine pal for le.”Casper requires a quiet, adult only home as the only pet.

There’s absolutely no doubt it’s a single event. It’s what we call epidemiologically speaking, a ‘point source’ linked with this teenage disco,” he added.The Elk has been contacted in response to this story.In revealing the impact, the PHA also urged young people to come forward to receive their Covid- jab, with a weekend of clinics available across Northern Ireland.Dr Brid Farrell, Deputy Director of Public Health at the PHA, said: “We would really encourage young people to come forward for their vaccination. It will help protect them and the people they care about.“The programme of special clinics this weekend will complement the ongoing school vaccination programme.”Those aged --years-old will require an adult to accompany them to a vaccine clinic to provide consent.  and  year olds are eligible for a second dose  weeks after their first dose.Vaccination clinic locations below:Saturday November · Ballymena - Seven Towers Leisure Centre: . am to . pm · Belfast - Ulster Rugby Kingspan Stadium: . am to . pm· Belfast - Ulster Hospital, acute services block: . am to . pm· Craigavon - Rushmere Centre: . am to . pm · Downpatrick - Downshire Hospital, Great Hall: . am to .pm· Enniskillen - South West Acute Hospital, key workers# accommodation: . am to . pm · Lisburn Primary and Community Care Centre: . am to . pm· Londonderry - Altnagelvin Hospital, Level , tower block: . am to . pm · Kilkeel Leisure Centre: . am to . pm · Omagh - Tyrone and Fermanagh Hospital, old school canteen: . am to . pm Sunday November · Ballymena - Seven Towers Leisure Centre: . am to . pm · Belfast - Ulster Rugby Kingspan Stadium: . am to . pm· Belfast - Ulster Hospital, acute services block: . am to . pm· Craigavon - Rushmere Centre: . am to . pm · Downpatrick - Downshire Hospital, Great Hall: . am to . pm· Dungannon - the Junction: . am to . pm · Enniskillen - South West Acute Hospital, key workers# accommodation: . am to . pm · Lisburn Primary and Community Care Centre: . am –to . pm· Londonderry - Altnagelvin Hospital Site, level , tower block: . am to .pm · Omagh - Tyrone and Fermanagh Hospital, old school canteen: . am to .pm Most ReadWarning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Long queues for Belfast petrol station#s Black Friday cut price dealTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressWhere old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmDUP Spad Emma Little-Pengelly paid £k when role ended after Arlene Foster exitTop VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen lands - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"PlayJody Waterworth on BBC Hope Street filming in DonaghadeePlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFLatest CoronavirusPublic urged to stay calm after news of new Covid iantCovid-linked staff shortages creating ‘an absolute nightmare’ for principalsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageViewpointOpinionHealthy approach to shopping is vitalNorthern Ireland guidance remains unchanged as UK government urges public to take lateral flow tests before Christmas shoppingLatestGusts of almost mph as UK is battered by Storm ArwenPharmaceutical firms work to tweak vaccines against new ‘Omicron’ iantOmicron iant: World races to contain new Covid threatTributes pour in for ‘musical theatre giant of our times’ Stephen SondheimMan dies as mph gusts batter the UK,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture Colm O#Reilly Belfast-- FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelfast city centre is expected to be busy for Black Friday salesClaire McNeillyTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailShoppers in Northern Ireland are expected to spend around £m on Black Friday deals alone, a leading economist has said.The ongoing pandemic means that most of that money will likely be spent online — a huge blow to the struggling high street retailers.Read MoreClaire McNeilly:OpinionBlack Friday: Streets or screens  The dilemma of big bargain ‘event’ and  deals to check outThe streets are, however, expected to be well populated with bargain hunters on what has become the biggest shopping day of the year.Dr Esmond Birnie told the Belfastthat shops here “will be hoping for a lot in both Black Friday and Christmas sales” after a “very trying” two years.The Ulster University senior economist also said there could be a gender imbalance when it comes to splashing the cash tomorrow.“The ious surveys out there are sending mixed messages as to whether Northern Ireland’s Black Friday spend per person will be up or down relative to  but there seems general agreement men will be spending more, on average, than women,” Dr Birnie said.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Elsewhere, experts have said UK shoppers will part with almost £bn before December  to make up for last year#s cancelled Christmas, with a massive £.bn being spent on Black Friday goodies alone.Research by vouchercodes also forecast spending up to Christmas Eve will be £.bn higher than in  and £bn up on last Christmas, when Covid- lockdowns put paid to family gatherings.It can be daunting for consumers to navigate the murky world of what to buy and what to avoid in the sales, especially when watchdogs are constantly warning that Black Friday ‘offers’ are not always the best deals.So here, the Belfastanswers five questions on snaffling deals without getting ripped off:Q Will buying on Black Friday guarantee the best prices A No. An investigation by consumer group Which  found that nine in  Black Friday so-called deals from shops were cheaper or the same price before the same sales day last year. But remember that inflation and shipping costs are pushing up prices of some items by five to % compared to earlier in the year. So although a deal might seem pricier than you expect, it could still be cheaper than where.Q Is it better to wait until Cyber Monday before buying A If you find the product you want at a reasonable cost, after comparing prices where, do buy on Black Friday. Yet, prices on some products can fall even further on Cyber Monday, which falls on November  this year.Q Does Black Friday just last one day A No. Now the sales go on for a week, a month, or even longer.Q What about the Boxing Day sales A This is the other great time of year to get a good bargain.For Black Friday, retailers and manufacturers spend months negotiating knockdowns to offer shoppers. The same happens for what used to be called the January sales, but which now start on Boxing Day. But at this time of year, retailers are also running more clearances of items which didn’t sell well during the run-up to Christmas.Q Should I hit the high street or go online A Why not do both  Black Friday is becoming an internet phenomenon, with fewer shoppers in the shops compared to the panicked scenes of previous years. It can be easier to compare prices on your computer at home. But, in the spirit of supporting local retailers, remember that there will be tempting offers in the physical shops too.Meanwhile, ahead of the bumper sale bonanza, leading price comparison site money has analysed several of the most sought-after items and put together a handy guide on which products consumers should steer clear of.Fitness equipment: If you’re looking to spend big on a rowing machine, weight bench or treadmill, then you should wait until the new year. Brands know that one of the most common new year’s resolutions is to ‘get in shape’, so they ramp up the deals in January to take advantage of the booming market.Clothing: Most clothing retailers have jumped on the Black Friday bandwagon, so it will be possible to get good reductions this week. Butyou want to get the very best price, then you might be better off waiting.

But the gap between our positions is still signicant and we are ready to use Article  to protect the BelfastAgreementother solutions cannot be found,” he said in a statement.Technical discussions between their teams will continue before the pair meet again next Friday.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Sefcovic said the emphasis of Friday’s talks was on the supply of medicines, adding: “A decisive push is needed to ensure predictability.“We’ll meet again next week.”International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has suggested that triggering Article  would not be used before Christmas.The protocol effectively places Northern Ireland in the EU’s single market for goods to help avoid a hard border with Ireland.But this has led to checks on goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, creating a barrier to trade within the UK.The meeting between Lord Frost and Mr Sefcovic also came at a time of strained relations over post-Brexit licences to fish in UK waters, with French fishermen protesting on Friday over the issue.Crews blocked French ports and ferry traffic crossing the Channel, causing disruption to the flow of goods in Calais, Ouistreham and Saint-Malo.Most ReadWarning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Long queues for Belfast petrol station#s Black Friday cut price dealTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressWhere old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmDUP Spad Emma Little-Pengelly paid £k when role ended after Arlene Foster exitTop VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVF - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"PlayJody Waterworth on BBC Hope Street filming in DonaghadeeLatest Northern IrelandGusts of almost mph as UK is battered by Storm ArwenMan dies as mph gusts batter the UKTributes are paid to popular principal killed after a falling tree struck his carGlentoran weather storm to jump into second and crank up the title heatPublic urged to stay calm after news of new Covid iantLatestGusts of almost mph as UK is battered by Storm ArwenPharmaceutical firms work to tweak vaccines against new ‘Omicron’ iantOmicron iant: World races to contain new Covid threatTributes pour in for ‘musical theatre giant of our times’ Stephen SondheimMan dies as mph gusts batter the UK,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Today, I have seven teachers off and four other staff. That is an absolute nightmare to manage. “On Monday, I had to contact the board of governors and agree that we would suspend Year  and  classes to allow us to cover junior classes for the day.”The school is back to blended learning, with all year groups studying from home one day a week.“We have to do that until further notice until I know my staff are back,” Mr Walsh said.

The Northern Ireland Substitute Teacher Register is there to call, but you can phone all day and nobody gets back to you. When you finally get someone, they tell you they’re already working, so it’s a waste of time.”Askedschools were getting enough guidance from the Department of Education, he replied: “We were told we could come back and remove our bubble system. In terms of guidance, there really isn’t any. They’re leaving that to schools to deal with themselves.”Alison Steen, the head of Drumrane Primary School, near Limavady, and the president of the Ulster Teachers’ Union, said she had similar problems.She agreed it was “very dficult” to get substitute teachers and said all schools had been forced to consider cancelling mass gatherings to keep students and staff safe.Ms Steen stressed that ato remote learning before Christmas was the last thing anyone wanted.“We want to keep children in schoolat all possible. I know of principals who are ringing a hundred subs in an evening to try and get cover for the next day, so they really are trying to keep classes open,” she said.Teaching unions have called on Education Minister Education Minister Michelle McIlveen to immediately publish guidance on keeping the transmission of Covid under control.The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents teaching and support staff unions, urged the minister to cancel all Christmas shows, assemblies and parent-teacher nights.The Department of Education said it was aware schools had been facing extra pressure during the pandemic.It added that were “currently no plans toto remote learning across all schools”. A spokesperson for the department said the Executive’s response to the Covid crisis was based on medical and scientic advice. They added: “The department is aware of the ongoing dficulties faced by some schools in securing appropriate cover as a result of staff absence, and acknowledges that inidual schools may need to consider a short period of remote learning for a class or classes, in response to local circumstances.“There are currently no plans for any school circuit breakers. Any decision to do so would be taken by the Executive and would be based on medical and scientic advice.”Related topicsDepartment of EducationMichelle McIlveenMore On Department of EducationLiam Neeson’s pride as Ballymena’s first integrated primary opens PremiumViewpointOpinionQuestions over wisdom of AQE testsEducation Minister extends Covid- support for childcare providersMore than  reports of  school TikTok accounts reported since October, reveals PSNICall for social media companies to take action to stamp out abuse from ‘rate your teacher’ Tik Tok videosMost ReadWarning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Long queues for Belfast petrol station#s Black Friday cut price dealTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressWhere old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmDUP Spad Emma Little-Pengelly paid £k when role ended after Arlene Foster exitTop VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVFPlayBlack Friday queues as GO Stations drop their fuel price by p Per LitreLatest Northern IrelandGusts of almost mph as UK is battered by Storm ArwenMan dies as mph gusts batter the UKTributes are paid to popular principal killed after a falling tree struck his carGlentoran weather storm to jump into second and crank up the title heatPublic urged to stay calm after news of new Covid iantLatestGusts of almost mph as UK is battered by Storm ArwenPharmaceutical firms work to tweak vaccines against new ‘Omicron’ iantOmicron iant: World races to contain new Covid threatTributes pour in for ‘musical theatre giant of our times’ Stephen SondheimMan dies as mph gusts batter the UK,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Department of Finance said she received a severance payment of £, on July .Mr Reynolds received a payment of £, on the same date.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFormer DUP special adviser Lee Reynolds FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFormer DUP special adviser Lee ReynoldsIn October , it was confirmed Ms Little-Pengelly received a severance payment after ceasing to be a Spad when she became an Assembly member —this was a contractual obligation.She was co-opted as MLA for South Belfast, replacing Jimmy Spratt. She later became a Junior Minister in the Executive, holding this post from October  to May .Ms Little-Pengelly was re-elected as an MLA in May , but lost out at the March  election, triggered by the resignation of Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, when the number of seats in each constituency was cut from six to five. She was allocated a £, resettlement allowance.She stood for MP in the June  Westminster election, taking the South Belfast seat from the SDLP’s Alasdair McDonnell, but lost it to Claire Hanna at the December  Westminster election.Parliamentary records show she received a £, ‘resettlement payment’. While the exact amount she received after her Spad role ceased in  was not disclosed, special advisers who had been in the job at least four years and left under these circumstances were entitled to six months’ salary. Ms Little-Pengelly’s salary at the time was just under £,.The Department of Finance confirmed there was no requirement for the settlement to be repaid after Ms Little-Pengelly ed as a Spad in . Earlier this month she confirmed she was resuming her career as a barrister.Ms Little-Pengelly said on Thursday: “My employment automatically came to an end when Arlene Foster left her role.“All Spad jobs are like this — the lack of security in these roles is why there is a redundancy aspect to the contract. If your Minister resigns or is sacked, then your employment ends. In this case, I received three months’ redundancy.”She added: “All public sector jobs have a redundancy arrangement, subject to how long you have been employed. This presumably recognises that it usually takes some time for people to find employment where etc, especially when their employment comes to a sudden end.”Ms Little-Pengelly added that redundancy payments “are not applied for and are paid automatically in line with the redundancy provisions set out in the contract”.She continued: “If a Spad resumes being a Spad within the period the redundancy applies, then the balance is repaid to ensure fairness — in my case in ,I resumed being a Spad within three months.“Redundancy or severance payments are always linked to the relevant employment and are payable in accordance with your contract in relation to that employment, not a previous one .”She said this was standard practice for public and private sector employment contracts.Mr Reynolds, the other recipient of a severance payment, was appointed a Spad to Mrs Foster last November. A former DUP group leader on Belfast City Council, he replaced Kim Ashton, who had previously quit after a few weeks in the role.Philip Weir, the other of Mrs Foster’s three Spads, stayed on as an adviser to First Minister Paul Givan, while Richard Bullick has ed, four years after quitting as a key aide.The other three Spads in The Executive Office are Dr Dara O’Hagan, Stephen McGlade and John Loughran.Read MoreSam McBride:OpinionArlene Foster has weakened the DUP’s Stormont veto by mistake, with major implications for the futureRelated topicsArlene FosterDepartment of Finance The Executive OfficeEdwin PootsBelfast City CouncilPaul GivanMost ReadWarning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Long queues for Belfast petrol station#s Black Friday cut price dealTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressWhere old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmDUP Spad Emma Little-Pengelly paid £k when role ended after Arlene Foster exitTop VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVF - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"PlayJody Waterworth on BBC Hope Street filming in DonaghadeeLatest Northern IrelandGusts of almost mph as UK is battered by Storm ArwenMan dies as mph gusts batter the UKTributes are paid to popular principal killed after a falling tree struck his carGlentoran weather storm to jump into second and crank up the title heatPublic urged to stay calm after news of new Covid iantLatestGusts of almost mph as UK is battered by Storm ArwenPharmaceutical firms work to tweak vaccines against new ‘Omicron’ iantOmicron iant: World races to contain new Covid threatTributes pour in for ‘musical theatre giant of our times’ Stephen SondheimMan dies as mph gusts batter the UK,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was also an apt description of the dark and heavy rain clouds hanging over Belfast city centre on Friday.Retailers would have been hoping for a constant ringing of tills, but the miserable weather — with storm Arwen bringing gales, downpours and even hailstones — clearly had put people off from hitting the shops and had them logging online instead. Read MoreBargain hunters reign in the rain as NI shoppers get that Black Friday feelingEven the popular Christmas market at Belfast City Hall appeared to be lighter on festive cheer.Although footfall appeared to be fairly brisk, lots of people were zigzagging across the main throughfares minus shopping bags — a sight that would disappoint store owners.And of those who were carrying bags, it was the familiar Primark logo that was a frequent occurrence, despite the retailer being one of a handful of big high street names, along with BM and Next, to shun the event.Zara appeared to be a popular choice, with the Royal Avenue store buzzing with fashion fans snapping up items with discounts of %.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sports fashion retailer JD Sports also appeared to be enticing in customers with what it had billed was its ‘biggest ever Black Friday’.Keen to take advantage of the bargains was Kilkeel man Brendan McVeigh who took the opportunity of Black Friday to make an overnight stay in Belfast.Laden with shopping bags displaying brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Mac and TKMaxx, the -year-old said the breadth of deals was not as evident this year.“The likes of Jack Wills would have had % off and it’s not happening this year.

Credit: Martyn Boyd FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueProfessor Ultan Power. Credit: Martyn Boyd“It also seems to be transmitting fast. It is very, very early days yet but the way it has taken hold within an area in South Africa is of concern,” he said.“Within a two-week period it went from one per cent of the positive samples. Today there is some suggestion that it is up to % of positive samples.“That suggests it is out-competing Delta, which is obviously a concern. Again, it’s early days. It’s something that needs to be monitored and taken seriously by the public health authorities and governments.”Prof Ian Young, Northern Ireland’s chief scientic adviser, said that “based on the early information we have this is probably the most concerning new iant” since the Delta form of the virus.He said the new B... iant has “a number of changes” compared with forms seen before.“And those may alter its behaviour in a way that makes it more easily transmitted,” he added.Meanwhile, chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride described the iant as a “matter of concern”.“This is undoubtedly a matter of concern. We are taking the action on international travel on a precautionary basis, while we await further evidence on the spread of this iant in South Africa and understand more about it.”Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist, also insisted it was a case of “wait and see”, adding: “There are still many unknowns and only time will tell how impactful B... is, but to be cautious we should act now to slow it down by bolstering border control and surveillance... and taking the usual measures to control virus spread at home.”Fellow Queen’s expert Dr Andrew Kunzmann, an epidemiologist, stressed that he didn’t think “people should panic yet, and calm heads are needed”.“Panic can be counterproductive and just cause people to disengage with the measures that can help to keep them safe,” he explained.“We don’t yet know enough about the new iant to estimate what impact this will have in Northern Ireland.”Dr Kunzmann continued: “However, fast action from governments is needed to delay importation of large numbers of cases whilst we try to improve our understanding of the new iant and get more vaccines and boosters to the people who need it.“Surveillance for new iants is only usefulit leads to swt action when something is flagged.” He admitted that measures such as quarantine for travellers ing from ‘red list’ areas may help “delay” the importing of the strain — along with the vaccination programme – but it is “unlikely to work for ever”.“It seems likely that vaccines will still offer protection against severe disease, and I’d still recommend anyone who isn’t vaccinated to get vaccinated,” he added.“However, new iants make it important to keep your immunity as high as possible, so I would encourage anyone who is offered a booster to take up that offer when possible.”Related topicsQueen’s UniversityMore On Queen’s UniversityNorthern Ireland guidance remains unchanged as UK government urges public to take lateral flow tests before Christmas shopping‘Male reproductive health has been largely ignored’ PremiumYou can push yourself: Alliance councillor Peter McReynolds living with multiple sclerosis to run for StormontQueen’s and Ulster staff to stage three-day strike as part of UK-wide action at UK universitiesCreating history project for the Troubles ‘could be done in an unbiased way’Most ReadWarning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Long queues for Belfast petrol station#s Black Friday cut price dealTV stars flood Instagram with messages of support for Corrie actressWhere old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmDUP Spad Emma Little-Pengelly paid £k when role ended after Arlene Foster exitTop VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Garfield Beattie found guilty of sending threat signed by UVF - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news aa .ece AUTOCROP wh abaeafcebebf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   - Picture Shows:Niamh OrsquoHare , Shay OrsquoHare , Siobhan OrsquoHare , Finn OrsquoHare , Leila Hussain , Clint Dunwoody , Nicole Devine , Barry Pettigrew , Marlene Pettigrew , Callum McCarthy-Long Story TV - Photographer: Christopher Barr\"PlayJody Waterworth on BBC Hope Street filming in DonaghadeeLatest Northern IrelandGusts of almost mph as UK is battered by Storm ArwenMan dies as mph gusts batter the UKTributes are paid to popular principal killed after a falling tree struck his carGlentoran weather storm to jump into second and crank up the title heatCovid-linked staff shortages creating ‘an absolute nightmare’ for principalsLatestGusts of almost mph as UK is battered by Storm ArwenPharmaceutical firms work to tweak vaccines against new ‘Omicron’ iantOmicron iant: World races to contain new Covid threatTributes pour in for ‘musical theatre giant of our times’ Stephen SondheimMan dies as mph gusts batter the UK,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

work to tweak vaccines against new omicron variant","story":"Pharmaceutical firms are looking at how vaccines might be tweaked against the new iant  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePharmaceutical firms are looking at how vaccines might be tweaked against the new iant By Aine Fox and Sam Blewett, PANovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWork is underway to look at tweaking vaccines against the new concerning strain of coronavirus that has sparked travel bans.The iant, named Omicron and designated a “iant of concern” by the World Health Organisation , has reached Belgium after being discovered in South Africa.The WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the iant has an increased risk of reinfection and may sp rapidly than other strains.A number of pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there is “huge international concern” surrounding the strain after banning flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia to limit its spread.Mr Javid told MPs there are concerns the iant may be more transmissible, make existing vaccines less effective and may hinder one of the UK’s Covid treatments, Ronapreve.Ministers were facing calls to go further to prevent a wave of the new iant arriving in Britain while a Delta surge is ongoing, as Belgium became the first EU country to announce a case.Professor John Edmunds, who advises the Government as part of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , warned that could create a “very, very, very dficult situation”.The EU, US and Canada all followed Britain’s move to impose travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa ahead of the WHO adding the strain, also known as B..., to its highest category for concerning iants.Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an “increased risk of reinfection” and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a “growth advantage”.Novavax said it has “already initiated development of a new recombinant spike protein based on the known genetic sequence of B... and will have it ready to begin testing and manufacturing within the next few weeks”.Moderna said: “Since early , Moderna has advanced a comprehensive strategy to anticipate new iants of concern.“This strategy includes three levels of response should the currently authorized  µgbooster dose of mRNA- prove insufficient to boost waning immunity against the Omicron iant.”Pfizer and BioNTech said that in the event of a iant which could escape the effects of the vaccines, the firm expects “to be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that iant in approximately  days, subject to regulatory approval”.No cases of the new strain have been detected in the UK but its arrival in Belgium – after being found in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel – has heightened concerns.Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the Rega Institute in Belgium, said a sample was confirmed as the iant in a traveller who ed from Egypt on November  before first showing symptoms  days later.The six African countries were added to the UK’s travel red list on Thursday evening and passengers arriving in the UK from these countries from am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a Government-approved hotel quarantine for  days.Downing Street urged anyone who has arrived from those countries recently to get tested.Mr Javid said discussions are ongoing over the prospect of adding further countries to the red list, telling the Commons the Government “won’t hesitate to actwe need to do so”.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ce

South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday afternoon after foreign minister Naledi Pandor said the flight ban “seems to have been rushed”.The Prime Minister “commended South Africa’s rapid genomic sequencing” and its “leadership in transparently sharing scientic data”, Downing Street said.“They discussed the challenges posed globally by the new Covid- iant and ways to work together to deal with it and reopen international travel,” a statement said.Prof Edmunds said the new strain “is a huge worry” and that “all the data suggests” it would be able to evade current immunity.“Our fears are it would do so to a large extent,” he told BBC Radio ’s PM programme.Prof Edmunds urged ministers to look at extending travel restrictions and to prepare a plan to deal with Omicron because “at some point we’re going to get this iant here in the UK”.But Professor Brendan Wren, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said people should “stay calm and not overreact”, adding that scientists can “easily mody vaccines to meet new iants”.Striking an optimistic tone in the Daily Mail, he wrote: “In the arms race against the virus, humanity is winning – and we are well prepared. This is not the last time another iant will emerge.“In the meantime, it is vital to remember to stay calm and not overreact.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

His father, who died suddenly in March , competed in triathlons for Ireland and was a member of the North West Triathlon Club. Dannyhas now raised over pound, for mental health and wellbeing organisations across the city. Over his -day challenge, people from across the city and district joined him for sections of his challenge, with others lining routes to cheer him on. Danny thanked the people of Derry saying they “lted him up, and filled him with adrenaline.” He said: “Thank you all so much, from the bottom of my heart, from the sweat on my brow to the blisters on my feet, thank you. And of course, to my daddy, I hope I made you proud big man. Danny spent much of the year training for thechallenge starting on August , which consisted of a. mileswim, followed by a milecycle and then a milemarathon, every day for  consecutive days. At a meeting of Derry City and Strabane District Council on Thursday, a motion proposed by Sinn Feacuteins Christopher Jackson and Sandra Duffy, calling for the honour to be bestowed on Mr Quigley, passed unanimously. Councillor Jackson said: “The challenge itself caught the imagination of the city and the most important element of it is the promotion of positive mental health. Danny has raised over pound, for local mental health charities and he has created a lasting legacy. This motion is a way ofacknowledgingDanny, his family and all the supporters that helped him complete this task. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane and DUP Councillor Graham Warke said Danny has brought a city together and said it was something that was very much needed” during such a dficult time. “I’ve never seen anyone  do that,” he said, “The money and awareness he has raised, he is a credit to everybody and to his family.” Sandra Duffy added: “The work that he has done and the awareness he has raised has been absolutely tremendous.“We have a really ordinary citizen who has done an extraordinary thing.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

However, Mr Durkan – who is also the SDLPs Justice Spokesperson – accused Ms Hargey of resting “on her laurels” and that her “lackadaisical approach” would leave those in desperate need of support in a vulnerable position. He said: “There is no denying that the winter period will present a huge challenge for already struggling households. “The cruel cuts to Universal Credit, spiralling energy costs and the economic fallout of the pandemic have created a perfect storm. “Yet despite persistent calls for an emergency support package or a Household Support Fund similar to that announced in England in September for vulnerable families, the Minister rests on her laurels. “Minister Hargey cannot laud the North’s ‘unique’ Discretionary Support Scheme as a cure-all amidst the unfolding cost of living crisis. “A scheme, which she seems to have forgotten failed serve its intended purpose of protecting people here, evidenced in theof pound million of unspent funds. “Again, Minister Hargey’s lackadaisical approach to protecting the vulnerable and in this case, outright dereliction of duty will leave people without adequate support at a time when they need it most.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

Seaacuten Mellon, one of the clubs founders and a man whose influence on hurling in the city has touched almost every club, passed away on Friday. The senior hurlers were at training when they heard the news, with centre back Breandaacuten Quigley tweeting his condolences afterwards. “It was with deep sadness I heard of the passing of Seaacuten Mellon, an absolute Titan of hurling andof hurling in the city,” he said, “Probably fitting that we were informed of his passing while on the field. It’s oft said, but we really will never see the likes of him again.” Mellons legacy is a hurling side whose stock continue to rise. Action from Lavey v Na Magha in Ballyarnett earlier this year. They competed well in this years Antrim league, reaching the Division  semi finals where they were defeated by a strong Cuacutechullains Armagh side. Championship action in Derry though, has proved both frustrating and disappointing. The frustration stems from the fact the club were denied a chance to compete in a county final following the withdrawal of opponents Eoghan Rua. The Coleraine side had come through a bruising senior football encounter with Slaughtneil the previous week, and the decision caused anger and frustration in Ballyarnett. Derrys hurling championship provided plenty of games for the city men, but results were disappointing given the elevated standard of those they faced. Attacking talisman Deacuteaglaacuten Foley. They lost all four group games by an average margin of  points, coming closest to Ballinascreen in their final outing, where they lost by nine. The defeats skew their statistics. They have scored a total of - , giving them a scoring average of . points per game. At the other end, they have shipped - , an average concession per game of . points. In comparison, Cootehill have had four championship games, in which they have scored a total of - , giving them a scoring average of . points per game. A concession of -leaves an average concession of . points per game. Na Magha will point in mitigation to the standard of teams they had to play in a group that contained senior runners-up Kevin Lynchs, and there is no doubt the dficulty of the Derry championship is greater. Personnel wise, the threat from the Cavan champions arises from full forward Diarmuid Carney, who registered - in the county final, with - coming from play. Cootehill celebrate lting the Cavan title. Half back Fiachra Hughes hit - for Celtic, while their two goals came from midfielder Oisiacuten Carolan and corner forward James McKay. For Na Magha, the experienced Breandaacuten Quigley will hope to drive his side on from the heart of defence, while they have a number of pacey forwards who will trouble Cootehill. Keelan Doherty tortured defences in Antrim all year, while Deacuteaglaacuten Foley, Timothy Rankin and Padraig Nelis all carry an attacking threat. A .pm throw-in away in Cavan adds another layer of dficulty, but the Derry side are no strangers to adversity, and in a week where they lost a club legend, will be determined to come home with the win. CHAMPIONSHIP STATS    Deep sadness as Derry hurling stalwart passes away  Seaacuten Mellon was one of the founding members of Na Magha CLG.

The ladies were quick to remind him they had tasted the adrenaline of the provincial stage, but for the men, currently waiting in the wings, this is uncharted territory. Although Sean Dolans made things sticky for them, St Martins eventually pulled away for a ten-point win which secured back-to-back junior titles. They leave a great deal of created history in their wake. The  crown, won in , was the clubs first junior title since , and they became the first team to win the championship twice within one calendar year last month. Desertmartin management team. ONeill says the players are keenly aware they are living through history. “Its a great place to be in really,” he said. “None of these boys have ever had this opportunity and there are boys round training saying theyve never trained in November before. “I know the weather hasnt been great, but you can see the boys want to be there and they want to grab this opportunity with both hands. “We also have to be mindful that we may never get this opportunity again, so its about making the most of it while we are here. “There are clubs who have had success over the past few years, that have been going in Ulster and they know what theyre at, whereas its new to our boys. “At the minute, were making the most of it.” The double junior champions will be without Ryan McGuckin, who suffered a broken jaw in the Derry semi final win over Craigbane, while Marty Breen is again an injury doubt. Enda McGuckin Desertmartin are yet to concede a goal in championship football this season, and have conceded a paltry - across their five games. A total of -at the other end leaves them averaging . points per game and an average concession of just  points per game. In Derry, they have been almost impenetrable. Their opponents, St Patricks Donagh, are coming from a similar favourites position in Fermanagh. Like Desertmartin, they were tipped to win the championship and duly did so. Managed by Ballinascreen man and former Derry ladies manager Paul Hasson, they saw off neighbours Newtownbutler in the Fermanagh final. Across four championship games, they conceded - , leaving an average concession rate of  points per game, but their total at the other end may point to Desertmartins toughest test yet. Donagh celebrating their Fermanagh title. Donagh have racked up -in four games, only failing to find the net once in their opening-day defeat, also against Newtownbutler. They have averaged . points per game, something that may raise a few eyebrows in the Derry sides defence, and manager Kevin ONeill says it will be a massive test. “Ive seen a few videos of them, so Ive been able to watch a couple of their games. They won Division  in Fermanagh and are probably playing in a championship below where they should be,” he said. “They were favourites to win it and they went on and won it, which is testament to them putting their shoulder to the wheel and responded to a wee bit of pressure. “They have a lot of experience in their team theyre big and physical, so we definitely wont be taking them lightly.”  The club has been the centre of a real buzz since the county final. The club held their dinner dance, giving a chance for everyone to celebrate their achievements. A breakfast event has been organised for the morning of the game, before a bus will transport supporters to Enniskillen. ONeill says the players have to prepare a little dferently. “You probably dont realise it when youre just going to training, but there is a huge buzz around the place,” he said. “Theyre making the most of this opportunity and everybody in the club is aware that this doesnt come around too often and we want to make the most of it when it does. “Its the biggest game of these boys club careers, but so far theyve answered everybodys questions when the pressure has come on. “Its been a long wait, really four weeks is a long time, but well take an Ulster campaign no matter how long we have to wait.” CHAMPIONSHIP STATS    KEY PLAYERS DESERTMARTIN Lachlan Murray  Murray, an All-Ireland minor winner with Derry, is a precocious talent. He has the ability to unlock a packed defence and has a willingness to work hard to find shooting opportunities Equally comfortable playing on the loop and taking men on to go directly through the middle, he is a player who will certainly be on the radar of the Fermanagh men. DONAGH Brian McDermott A - haul from full forward McDermott helped Donagh to victory in the Fermanagh final, and the full forward has time again proved the focal point for his sides attacking options. He hit consecutive hattricks in the games against Brookeborough and Coa, and flanked by the very able Eimhin Curran and Ryan Kelly, who both scored goals in the final, he is a formidable opponent.

It is popular amongst children and adults and generates festive cheer in every Irish household bringing a sprinkle of magic across the country. Each year there are guest appearances from many people ranging from celebrities to local heroes and family members of the participating children, youre sure to see a familiar face or two! Heres a round-up of the greatest guest appearances in Toy Show history  Girls Aloud  Toby appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and was surprised by mega girl-band Girls Aloud when he was performing their song on a Karaoke machine. Little Toby was stunned to see the pop group in person.   Ed Sheeran -  The greatest duet in ! Aimee Keogh was speaking about her love for music when showing Ryan Tubridy a Karaoke Machine, and included Ed Sheeran in her list of favourite artists. Ryan Tubridy and Aimee began to duet Lego House by Ed Sheeran, when she was surprised by the man himself. Starstruck and surprised by his appearance, she began to sing with Ed Sheeran on the Karoke Machine. Mr. Sheeran surprised her with tickets to his concert in London that year.  Danny from the Script  A group of three children sang Superheroes by the Script on the Late Late Toy Show in  as they were big fans of The Script. The band were surprised by lead singer Danny who thought their performance was amazing and said they would give The Script a run for their money. Mr. ODonoghue invited the boys to perform at their soundcheck in Croke Park that year. X Robbie Keane  Domhnall appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and spoke about his hero Robbie Keane and listed out several facts about the soccer star. It was evident Mr. Keane was his role model as he had a vast knowledge about him, his career, and his recent injury that year. Domhnall was overwhelmed when Robbie Keane surprised him on set and he was allowed to ask questions about his career.  Evelyn Cusack  Johnny charmed viewers when he spoke about his passion for the weather and his admiration for Evelyn Cusack who presents the weather on RTE One. He told Ryan he plays a game called Whos it going to be for the weather forecast and always hopes it is Evelyn, he also invented a board game called Aimsir. Evelyn Cusack surprised him on set, and Johnny was thrilled to see her.  Dermot Kennedy  Michael Moloney performed a Dermot Kennedy song on the Toy Show last year and was surprised by Dermot Kennedy mid-song during his performance. Michael was very professional and continued singing despite the shock and surprise sketched on his face. It was a truly heartwarming moment that uplted the viewers as we battled our second lockdown last year.  Davy Fitz: One of the most iconic moments in Toy Show history, Michael won the hearts of the nation when he appeared on the Toy Show. He revealed his favourite GAA manager was Davy Fitz and joked that he did not think they would get along as he was from six-mile bridge. Dvy Fitz walked out and surprised Michael, who was bewildered by his appearance. He asked Mr. Fitz to sign his book as he had brought it along with him . Davy invited Michael to speak to the Wexford team before their league matches.  While many celebrities drop by to say hello to Ryan and the children, family members also make an appearance. These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .  Graham Burke  Adam and Kayla Burke from Midleton, Co Cork were reunited with their dad Sergeant Graham Burke in a heartwarming reunion. Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him. During his segment on the Toy Show, Adams favourite hospital porter surprised him on set and Adam gave him a virtual hug. John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family. It was an emotional reunion as Lee had not seen his sister in three years and embraced her in a big hug.  Many more memorable appearances have occurred throughout the history of the Late Late Toy Show, and tonight will be no dferent. The list continues to grow with every show, and itreally is the most wonderful time of the year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

It is popular amongst children and adults and generates festive cheer in every Irish household bringing a sprinkle of magic across the country. Each year there are guest appearances from many people ranging from celebrities to local heroes and family members of the participating children, youre sure to see a familiar face or two! Heres a round-up of the greatest guest appearances in Toy Show history  Girls Aloud  Toby appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and was surprised by mega girl-band Girls Aloud when he was performing their song on a Karaoke machine. Little Toby was stunned to see the pop group in person.   Ed Sheeran -  The greatest duet in ! Aimee Keogh was speaking about her love for music when showing Ryan Tubridy a Karaoke Machine, and included Ed Sheeran in her list of favourite artists. Ryan Tubridy and Aimee began to duet Lego House by Ed Sheeran, when she was surprised by the man himself. Starstruck and surprised by his appearance, she began to sing with Ed Sheeran on the Karoke Machine. Mr. Sheeran surprised her with tickets to his concert in London that year.  Danny from the Script  A group of three children sang Superheroes by the Script on the Late Late Toy Show in  as they were big fans of The Script. The band were surprised by lead singer Danny who thought their performance was amazing and said they would give The Script a run for their money. Mr. ODonoghue invited the boys to perform at their soundcheck in Croke Park that year. X Robbie Keane  Domhnall appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and spoke about his hero Robbie Keane and listed out several facts about the soccer star. It was evident Mr. Keane was his role model as he had a vast knowledge about him, his career, and his recent injury that year. Domhnall was overwhelmed when Robbie Keane surprised him on set and he was allowed to ask questions about his career.  Evelyn Cusack  Johnny charmed viewers when he spoke about his passion for the weather and his admiration for Evelyn Cusack who presents the weather on RTE One. He told Ryan he plays a game called Whos it going to be for the weather forecast and always hopes it is Evelyn, he also invented a board game called Aimsir. Evelyn Cusack surprised him on set, and Johnny was thrilled to see her.  Dermot Kennedy  Michael Moloney performed a Dermot Kennedy song on the Toy Show last year and was surprised by Dermot Kennedy mid-song during his performance. Michael was very professional and continued singing despite the shock and surprise sketched on his face. It was a truly heartwarming moment that uplted the viewers as we battled our second lockdown last year.  Davy Fitz: One of the most iconic moments in Toy Show history, Michael won the hearts of the nation when he appeared on the Toy Show. He revealed his favourite GAA manager was Davy Fitz and joked that he did not think they would get along as he was from six-mile bridge. Dvy Fitz walked out and surprised Michael, who was bewildered by his appearance. He asked Mr. Fitz to sign his book as he had brought it along with him . Davy invited Michael to speak to the Wexford team before their league matches.  While many celebrities drop by to say hello to Ryan and the children, family members also make an appearance. These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .  Graham Burke  Adam and Kayla Burke from Midleton, Co Cork were reunited with their dad Sergeant Graham Burke in a heartwarming reunion. Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him. During his segment on the Toy Show, Adams favourite hospital porter surprised him on set and Adam gave him a virtual hug. John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family. It was an emotional reunion as Lee had not seen his sister in three years and embraced her in a big hug.  Many more memorable appearances have occurred throughout the history of the Late Late Toy Show, and tonight will be no dferent. The list continues to grow with every show, and itreally is the most wonderful time of the year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Storm Arwen is to bring bring large coastal wavesWeatherStorm Arwen: Weather warnings issued as strong winds forecast across Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry student, Emma McCaughey with her brother John.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24Novemeber2021_StreetBoost.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

Latest news bulletins are reporting ever increasing numbers of confirmed cases of Covid- in the last few days causing hospitals and intensive care units to be overwhelmed, indeed to breaking point. Millions, many of them children, remain unvaccinated in impoverished countries, and at huge risk to infection, serious illness, and death. Changing climate concerns intensy with serious threat to the future of the world.

That is also the message of today’s gospel narrative. Even in the midst of the world’s confusion and chaos, Jesus reassures us: “The Kingdom of God is near”. As dficult as it may sometimes be to discern its presence. Our Lord faced turbulent times as well – born of parents forced to seek shelter for the night in a cow shed – not exactly the palace of a prince or king. Yet, the surprise of Christ’s incarnation forces us to look again in our own age at the “signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars”, and to consider anew the signs of God’s involvement in the world about us.Advent is the season when we learn to overcome our “fear and foreboding” and once more open our hearts to others just as God has disclosed and demonstrated his love for us in Christ.Advent also reminds us that our spiritual winter will come to an end. The fig tree will again blossom and bloom. “Summer is near,” our Lord reassures us – even at the beginning of Advent. “Our redemption is drawing near.”Amid all the dficulties of this le, when uncertainty and fear loom near, may we ever look to Jesus, and put all our faith and trust in Him, mindful that His word and promise to His people “will not pass away”.Let us remember His timely warning: “Be on your guard”. We must always recall that, as the Gospel reminds us, our Lord will come like a thief in the night, and at a time when we least expect him. As we enter the Advent season, may we be vigilant, awake, and always on our guard for Christ’s ‘Second Coming’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Sadly the proposals for Covid passports are none of these things“Whilst I acknowledge that it would take an act of political bravery to change our position on Domestic Certication, I would strongly encourage Executive colleagues to do so.”Mr Lyons said that with every passing hour it became more apparent there was a “myriad of issues” with the scheme. He said there had been a lack of meaningful engagement with sectors that would have to use it.He said the announcement of the plan has already had a “very real” economic impact.Mr Lyons claimed hotels in the region had been hit with £ million worth of cancellations in the first two days after the policy was agreed.He said Christmas parties and other bookings were being cancelled on a “worryingly regular basis”.“For an industry that had felt singled out during the pandemic, and has borne the brunt of restrictions, this is all hard for them to take,” he said.“It is abundantly clear from listening to the hospitality sector that it is neither fair nor reasonable to introduce this policy within a matter of days when as late as this morning no regulations nor details have been shared with them.”He said he was especially concerned about the effect on small restaurants and cafes who not do have enough “staff or space” to carry out the checks on certs.Gordon LyonsStormont ExecutiveRobin SwannEconomy MinisterNorthern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularUnionist backlash against PUP Deputy leader John Kyle support for Northern Ireland ProtocolJamie Bryson seeks leave to have door staff case heard in UK’s highest courtMotorist confirmed dead after tree falls on car in AntrimPeacemaker asks why politicians have not contacted him after Protestant beaten for moving into ‘republican’ area - and warned to leave or be shotJohn Kyle of PUP talks of the opportunities of the Northern Ireland ProtocolMost PopularOur favourite Ninja Black Friday discounts  - best deals on air fryers, multi-cookers, juicersBest JD Sports Black Friday deals : up to % off, with deals on trainers, Gazelles, menswear, womenswearBest Black Friday clothing deals : best deals from Pretty Little Things, Arket, ASOS, HM, Sweaty BettyThe best Black Friday bargains for toys, including Disney, Lego, Harry Potter, Paw Patrol Best Black Friday clothing deals : best deals from Pretty Little Things, Arket, ASOS, and Sweaty Betty                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Sadly the proposals for Covid passports are none of these things“Whilst I acknowledge that it would take an act of political bravery to change our position on Domestic Certication, I would strongly encourage Executive colleagues to do so.”Mr Lyons said that with every passing hour it became more apparent there was a “myriad of issues” with the scheme. He said there had been a lack of meaningful engagement with sectors that would have to use it.He said the announcement of the plan has already had a “very real” economic impact.Mr Lyons claimed hotels in the region had been hit with £ million worth of cancellations in the first two days after the policy was agreed.He said Christmas parties and other bookings were being cancelled on a “worryingly regular basis”.“For an industry that had felt singled out during the pandemic, and has borne the brunt of restrictions, this is all hard for them to take,” he said.“It is abundantly clear from listening to the hospitality sector that it is neither fair nor reasonable to introduce this policy within a matter of days when as late as this morning no regulations nor details have been shared with them.”He said he was especially concerned about the effect on small restaurants and cafes who not do have enough “staff or space” to carry out the checks on certs.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe iant, named Omicron and designated a ldquoiant of concern by the World Health Organisation , has reached Belgium after being discovered in South Africa.The WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the iant has an increased risk of reinfection and may sp rapidly than other strains.A number of pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said there is ldquohuge international concern surrounding the strain after banning flights from South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia to limit its spread.Mr Javid told MPs there are concerns the iant may be more transmissible, make existing vaccines less effective and may hinder one of the UKrsquos Covid treatments, Ronapreve.Ministers were facing calls to go further to prevent a wave of the new iant arriving in Britain while a Delta surge is ongoing, as Belgium became the first EU country to announce a case.Professor John Edmunds, who advises the Government as part of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , warned that could create a ldquovery, very, very dficult situation.The EU, US and Canada all followed Britainrsquos move to impose travel restrictions on visitors from southern Africa ahead of the WHO adding the strain, also known as B..., to its highest category for concerning iants.Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an ldquoincreased risk of reinfection and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a ldquogrowth advantage.Novavax said it has ldquoalready initiated development of a new recombinant spike protein based on the known genetic sequence of B... and will have it ready to begin testing and manufacturing within the next few weeks..removeModerna said: ldquoSince early , Moderna has advanced a comprehensive strategy to anticipate new iants of concern.ldquoThis strategy includes three levels of response should the currently authorized  microgbooster dose of mRNA- prove insufficient to boost waning immunity against the Omicron iant.Pfizer and BioNTech said that in the event of a iant which could escape the effects of the vaccines, the firm expects ldquoto be able to develop and produce a tailor-made vaccine against that iant in approximately  days, subject to regulatory approval.No cases of the new strain have been detected in the UK but its arrival in Belgium ndash after being found in Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel ndash has heightened concerns.Marc Van Ranst, a virologist at the Rega Institute in Belgium, said a sample was confirmed as the iant in a traveller who ed from Egypt on November  before first showing symptoms  days later.The six African countries were added to the UKrsquos travel red list on Thursday evening and passengers arriving in the UK from these countries from am on Sunday will be required to book and pay for a Government-approved hotel quarantine for  days.Downing Street urged anyone who has arrived from those countries recently to get tested.Mr Javid said discussions are ongoing over the prospect of adding further countries to the red list, telling the Commons the Government ldquowonrsquot hesitate to actwe need to do so.\" data-title\"HEALTH Coronavirus\" data--holder\"PA
